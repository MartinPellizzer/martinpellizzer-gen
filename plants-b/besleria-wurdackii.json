It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flames. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and produces vibrant orange-red flowers with a unique, elongated shape. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
