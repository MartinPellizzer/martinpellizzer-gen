    "intro": "Bejaria neblinensis, commonly known as the misty bejaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bejaria neblinensis is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
