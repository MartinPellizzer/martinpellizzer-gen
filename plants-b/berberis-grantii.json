    "intro": "Berberis grantii, commonly known as the Grant's barberry, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting berries, which attract birds and add visual interest to gardens."
