    "intro": "Banksia alliacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia alliacea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
