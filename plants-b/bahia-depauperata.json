    "intro": "Bahia depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and delicate, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. Bahia depauperata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid environments."
