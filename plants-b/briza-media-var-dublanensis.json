    "intro": "Briza media var. dublanensis, commonly known as the Dublan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and delicate, feathery inflorescences that resemble those of other briza species. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds a subtle ornamental quality to its appearance. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
