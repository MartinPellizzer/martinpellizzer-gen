    "intro": "Betula glutinosa var. pseudalpestris, commonly known as the alpine birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its slender, upright growth habit. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine zones. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
