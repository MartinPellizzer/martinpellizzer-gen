    "intro": "Bulbophyllum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered torch orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, red-brown inflorescence with small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically borne on a single, erect spike and bloom during the warmer months. Bulbophyllum parviflorum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
