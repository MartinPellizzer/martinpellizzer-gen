    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
