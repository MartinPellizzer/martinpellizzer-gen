It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Begonia lancifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
