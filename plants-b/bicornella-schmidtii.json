    "intro": "Bicornella schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's bicorn, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive biconvex leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Bicornella schmidtii is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
