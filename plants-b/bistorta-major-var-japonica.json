It features upright, rhizomatous stems that produce clusters of pinkish-white to lavender flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported astringent properties."
