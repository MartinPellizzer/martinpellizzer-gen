    "intro": "Bergera nitida, commonly known as the African snowball, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its pale blooms. Bergera nitida is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in containers or as a garden specimen."
