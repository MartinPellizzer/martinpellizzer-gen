    "intro": "Bromus japonicus subsp. subsquarrosus, commonly known as the Japanese brome, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
