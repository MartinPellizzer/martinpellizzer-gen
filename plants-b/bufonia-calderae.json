    "intro": "Bufonia calderae, commonly known as the Caldera bufonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic soils of the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained habitats and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its volcanic environment. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Bufonia calderae is considered a vulnerable species."
