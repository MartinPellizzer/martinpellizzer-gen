These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. Brabejaria species are typically climbing vines with heart-shaped leaves and produce vibrant, colorful blooms that attract pollinators. They thrive in warm, humid climates and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Some species are also used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits."
