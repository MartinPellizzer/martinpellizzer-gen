    "intro": "Brugmansia cornigera, commonly known as the white angel's trumpet, is a striking tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that are particularly noticeable in the evening. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Brugmansia cornigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
