    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a fern-like fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided, giving it a unique and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium obliquum var. dissectum is an important species for studying the evolution of ferns and their ecological roles in forest ecosystems."
