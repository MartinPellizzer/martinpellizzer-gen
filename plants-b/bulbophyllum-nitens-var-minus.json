    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nitens var. minus, commonly known as the small-flowered bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for under the right conditions."
