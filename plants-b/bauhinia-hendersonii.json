It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that split into five to seven lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its seeds are encased in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds.
