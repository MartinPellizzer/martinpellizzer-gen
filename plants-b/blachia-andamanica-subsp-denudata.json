    "intro": "Blachia andamanica subsp. denudata, commonly known as the Andaman blachia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andaman Islands. It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale green, and appear in the axils of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
