    "intro": "Borbonia axillaris, commonly known as the Madagascar ash tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
