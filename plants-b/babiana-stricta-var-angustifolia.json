It is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer or early autumn, producing clusters of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
