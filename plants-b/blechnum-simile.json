    "intro": "Blechnum simile, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, tongue-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Blechnum simile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
