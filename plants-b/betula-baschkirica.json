    "intro": "Betula baschkirica, commonly known as the Bashkir birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its slender, often twisted trunk. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in forest-steppe and subalpine zones."
