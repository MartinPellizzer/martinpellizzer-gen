    "intro": "Balanocarpus utilis, commonly known as the white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its durable wood, it has been historically valued for construction and furniture-making."
