    "intro": "Byrsonima ferruginea var. macrophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or red mangabey apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in wet tropical forests and riverine areas. The plant is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and small, red or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a small, round berry that turns red when mature and is edible, though often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a shallow root system and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
