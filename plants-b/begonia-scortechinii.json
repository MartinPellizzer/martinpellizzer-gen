It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or white underside. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Begonia scortechinii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
