    "intro": "Beccariella dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often resembling a ghostly apparition. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, Beccariella dubia is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
