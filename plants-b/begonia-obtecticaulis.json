    "intro": "Begonia obtecticaulis, commonly known as the carpet begonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its foliage is particularly attractive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting. Begonia obtecticaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
