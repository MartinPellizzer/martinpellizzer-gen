    "intro": "Bromus gynandrus, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and glabrous, with a bluish-green hue. Bromus gynandrus is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
