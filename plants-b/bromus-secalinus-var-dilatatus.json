    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. dilatatus, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown."
