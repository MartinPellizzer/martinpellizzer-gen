    "intro": "Bignonia xylocarpa, commonly known as the yellow shower vine, is a climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
