    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. monostachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue-gray spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
