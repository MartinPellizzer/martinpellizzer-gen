    "intro": "Banksia spiculigera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. Banksia spiculigera plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
