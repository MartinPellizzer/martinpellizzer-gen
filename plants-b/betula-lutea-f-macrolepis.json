    "intro": "Betula lutea f. macrolepis, commonly known as the yellow birch variant with large scales, is a variant of the yellow birch tree. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish bark and its unique leaf morphology. The leaves are typically longer and broader compared to the standard species, giving it a more pronounced appearance. This form is often found in the northern regions of North America, where it thrives in cooler climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
