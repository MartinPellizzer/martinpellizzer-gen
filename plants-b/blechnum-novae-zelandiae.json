    "intro": "Blechnum novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often dark green with a slightly glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
