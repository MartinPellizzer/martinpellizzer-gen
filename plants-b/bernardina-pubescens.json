    "intro": "Bernardina pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bernardina, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its hairy leaves and stems are features that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Bernardina pubescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
