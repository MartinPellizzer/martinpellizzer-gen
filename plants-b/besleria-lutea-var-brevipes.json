    "intro": "Besleria lutea var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf yellow besleria, is a compact bromeliad native to Central and South America. It features vibrant yellow bracts that surround its short, upright stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters near the base of the leaves. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a glossy surface that enhances its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
