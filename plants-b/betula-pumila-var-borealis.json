    "intro": "Betula pumila var. borealis, commonly known as the northern dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and heathland environments. Betula pumila var. borealis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic wildlife species."
