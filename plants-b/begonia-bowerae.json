    "intro": "Begonia bowerae, commonly known as the velvet leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a rich, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
