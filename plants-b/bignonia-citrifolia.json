    "intro": "Bignonia citrifolia, commonly known as the yellow shower vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of bright yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, green, edible fruits that turn red when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. Bignonia citrifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to climb or trail make it versatile for use in gardens and as a decorative plant."
