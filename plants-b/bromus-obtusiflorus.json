    "intro": "Bromus obtusiflorus, commonly known as the blunt-flowered brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are often tinged with purple. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and flat, with a bluish-green hue, and the flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. Bromus obtusiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
