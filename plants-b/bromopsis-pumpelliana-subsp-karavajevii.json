    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. karavajevii, commonly known as the Karavajev's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
