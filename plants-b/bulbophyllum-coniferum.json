    "intro": "Bulbophyllum coniferum, commonly known as the coniferous orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the Epidendroideae subfamily. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble coniferous trees, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
