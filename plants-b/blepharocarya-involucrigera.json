    "intro": "Blepharocarya involucrigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elliptical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain ecosystems."
