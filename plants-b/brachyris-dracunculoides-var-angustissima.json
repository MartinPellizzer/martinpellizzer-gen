    "intro": "Brachyris dracunculoides var. angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf brachyris, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
