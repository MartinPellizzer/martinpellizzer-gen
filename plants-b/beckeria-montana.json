It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms during the spring and early summer. Beckeria montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
