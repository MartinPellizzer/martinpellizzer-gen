    "intro": "Balaniella pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender pedicellate liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and closely appressed leaves that are usually green to reddish in color. The plant produces male and female gametophytes on separate plants, a feature common in many liverworts. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or soil banks. Balaniella pedicellaris is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid microhabitats."
