It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to greenish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, along roadsides, and in sandy or gravelly areas. This variant is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to other varieties of Bromus purgans."
