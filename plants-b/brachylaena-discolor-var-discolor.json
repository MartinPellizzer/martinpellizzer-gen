    "intro": "Brachylaena discolor var. discolor, commonly known as the red-hot poker tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
