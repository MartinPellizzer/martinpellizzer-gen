    "intro": "Bunium virescens, commonly known as green fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant produces small, ovoid fruits that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like anethole, have been used in traditional medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
