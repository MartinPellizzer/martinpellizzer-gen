    "intro": "Bromus asper var. grandis, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Bromus genus. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. This grass is often used for forage and in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological resilience."
