    "intro": "Bryobium puguahaanense, commonly known as the Puguahaan moss, is a rare and endemic species of liverwort found in specific tropical forest habitats. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves that form dense, cushion-like growths. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or decaying wood in humid climates. Its morphology includes a thalloid structure with distinct leaf arrangement and specialized pores for gas exchange. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator species for studying biodiversity in its native region."
