    "intro": "Bolbitis semicordata, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Bolbitis semicordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
