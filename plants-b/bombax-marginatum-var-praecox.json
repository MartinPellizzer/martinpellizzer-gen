    "intro": "Bombax marginatum var. praecox, commonly known as the early cotton tree, is a variant of the kapok tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom early in the year, often before the main flowering season of the species. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a hairy capsule. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
