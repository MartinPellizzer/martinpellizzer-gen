    "intro": "Brassica fruticulosa subvar. christobalii, commonly known as Christobal's mustard, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and small, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, triangular pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
