    "intro": "Betula ermanii subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The bark is typically smooth and light gray, with some varieties displaying a flaky texture. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils."
