    "intro": "Bollea lalindei, commonly known as the Lalinde's bellflower, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant has a compact, herbaceous growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bollea lalindei is considered an endangered species."
