    "intro": "Bromus unioloides subf. achalensis, commonly known as the Achal mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of alpine ecosystems."
