    "intro": "Brachypodium villosum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial plant characterized by its\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium villosum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas. It is also valued for its use in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics research."
