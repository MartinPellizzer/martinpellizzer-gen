    "intro": "Betula chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Betula chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
