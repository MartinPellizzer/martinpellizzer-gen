    "intro": "Bonyunia excelsa, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of water bodies, while its stems are buoyant and support the leaves. Bonyunia excelsa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
