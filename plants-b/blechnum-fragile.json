    "intro": "Blechnum fragile, commonly known as the brittle hartscale, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and sometimes tinged with red or brown at the tips. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a continuous presence in the undergrowth throughout the year."
