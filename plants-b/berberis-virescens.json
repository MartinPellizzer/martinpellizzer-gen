    "intro": "Berberis virescens, commonly known as the evergreen barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It features dense, spiny foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and winter interest make it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
