    "intro": "Biermannia sarcanthoides, commonly known as the golden bell or golden cup, is a striking tropical plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow, bell-shaped flowers that resemble small cups, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Biermannia sarcanthoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
