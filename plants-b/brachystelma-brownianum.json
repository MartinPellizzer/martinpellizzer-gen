It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and has a short, stocky stem with a single or few flowers at the top. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a distinctive hood-like structure, making it easily identifiable among other orchid species."
