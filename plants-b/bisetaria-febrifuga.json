    "intro": "Bisetaria febrifuga, commonly known as the feverfew plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive grayish-white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. Its medicinal properties are largely attributed to the compounds found in its leaves, such as parthenolide. Bisetaria febrifuga is often used in traditional medicine for its purported fever-reducing and anti-inflammatory effects."
