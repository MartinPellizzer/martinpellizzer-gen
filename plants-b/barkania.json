    "intro": "Barkania, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fibrous, woody bark is thick and often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Barkania is well adapted to arid environments and is often used as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
