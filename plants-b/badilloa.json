    "intro": "Badilloa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. They produce showy, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and purple, which bloom in the spring or early summer. The genus includes several species, such as Badilloa ambigua and Badilloa saxicola, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environments. Their botanical features make them well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry climates."
