    "intro": "Bignonia ternata, commonly known as the yellow trumpetvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its opposite, trifoliate leaves and showy, orange-yellow, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Bignonia ternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
