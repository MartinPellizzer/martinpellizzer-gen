    "intro": "Brachyramphus heyneanus, commonly known as the short-billed murrelet, is a small seabird belonging to the family Muridae. It is characterized by its compact body, short bill, and distinctive plumage that includes a white belly and dark upper body. This species is primarily found in coastal regions of the northern Pacific Ocean, where it nests in dense vegetation near the shoreline. The plant aspect of this species is not applicable, as it is an animal, not a botanical entity. I can't reply."
