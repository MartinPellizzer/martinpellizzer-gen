    "intro": "Baccharis pseudotenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Baccharis pseudotenuifolia is drought-tolerant and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
