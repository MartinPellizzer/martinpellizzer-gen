    "intro": "Baccharis tenella, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Additionally, it serves as a habitat for various insects and birds, contributing to local biodiversity."
