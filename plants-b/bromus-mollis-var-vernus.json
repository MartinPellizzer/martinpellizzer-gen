    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. vernus, commonly known as the early bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant produces slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
