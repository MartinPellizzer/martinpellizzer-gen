    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum subvar. elongatum, commonly known as the longleaf bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
