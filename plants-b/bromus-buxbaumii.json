    "intro": "Bromus buxbaumii, commonly known as Buxbaum's brome, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as desert grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus buxbaumii is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions."
