It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually orange to yellow in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. Bignonia macrocalyx thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display."
