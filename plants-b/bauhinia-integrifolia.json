    "intro": "Bauhinia integrifolia, commonly known as the white wisteria or Brazilian wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are usually deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces pendant clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Bauhinia integrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
