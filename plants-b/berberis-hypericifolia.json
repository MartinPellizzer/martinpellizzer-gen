    "intro": "Berberis hypericifolia, commonly known as the golden barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and vibrant seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
