    "intro": "Brunfelsia terminalis, commonly known as the night bloomer or star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers open at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture, while the fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds."
