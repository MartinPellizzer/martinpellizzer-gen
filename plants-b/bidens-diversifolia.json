    "intro": "Bidens diversifolia, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces seeds with slender, hairy appendages that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Bidens diversifolia is often considered a weed but has ecological and medicinal significance in some regions."
