    "intro": "Blechnum coriaceum, commonly known as the tough fern or leather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its sturdy, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Blechnum coriaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
