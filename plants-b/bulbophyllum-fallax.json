    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fallax, commonly known as the false orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, often in humid tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in shaded, low-nutrient conditions. Bulbophyllum fallax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
