    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth, silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and landscaping purposes."
