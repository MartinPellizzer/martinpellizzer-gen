    "intro": "Begonia monterosae, commonly known as the Monterosa begonia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, clinging to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
