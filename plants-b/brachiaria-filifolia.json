    "intro": "Brachiaria filifolia, commonly known as silky grass or filifoliate grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, low-growing habit, often forming mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is both a valuable forage plant and an invasive species in some regions."
