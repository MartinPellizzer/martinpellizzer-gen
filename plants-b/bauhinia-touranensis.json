    "intro": "Bauhinia touranensis, commonly known as the Persian orchid tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, fern-like leaves that are often bi-lobed or trifoliate. The plant produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat."
