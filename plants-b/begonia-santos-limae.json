It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green to reddish hues, often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
