    "intro": "Bidens aspilioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, narrow, and usually hairy leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its fruit is a cluster of tiny, dry seeds enclosed in a pithy, spiny capsule. Bidens aspilioides is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it can become invasive in certain regions."
