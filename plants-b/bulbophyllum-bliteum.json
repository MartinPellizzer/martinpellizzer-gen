    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bliteum, commonly known as the Bliteum Pterostylis, is a rare orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble a small, elongated orchid with a single, forward-facing lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall understated appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
