    "intro": "Byrsonima yaroana, commonly known as wild cashew, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, edible fruits that contain a single seed. The fruit's pulp is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source, while the seeds are similar to cashews in appearance and flavor."
