    "intro": "Bromus retusus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with lemmas that are often hairy or bristly. Bromus retusus thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is often found in regions with moderate to cool climates and is valued for its role in ecological succession and soil stabilization."
