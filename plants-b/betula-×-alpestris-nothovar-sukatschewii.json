It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for alpine and boreal environments. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
