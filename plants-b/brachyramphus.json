    "intro": "Brachyramphus, commonly known as the auklet, is a genus of small seabirds belonging to the family Alcidae. These birds are characterized by their compact bodies, short wings, and distinctive plumage that varies among species. Brachyramphus species are primarily found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in coastal regions where they nest in dense vegetation or on cliffs. They are adept at diving underwater to catch fish, using their strong legs and webbed feet for propulsion. The genus includes several species, such as the least auklet and the thick-billed auklet, each with unique ecological adaptations."
