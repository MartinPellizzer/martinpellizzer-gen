    "intro": "Bastardia aristata, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in maritime environments. Bastardia aristata has narrow, silver-gray leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its showy blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
