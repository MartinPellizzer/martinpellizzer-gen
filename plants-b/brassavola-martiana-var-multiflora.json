    "intro": "Brassavola martiana var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflorous lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with intricate patterns resembling slipper shapes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its floral structure includes a distinctive pouch-like lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. This variety is prized by botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and ecological significance."
