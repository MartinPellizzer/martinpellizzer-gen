    "intro": "Byttneria melastomifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy byttneria, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common reproductive strategy in the Melastomataceae family. The plant's hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it an ornamental species in certain horticultural settings."
