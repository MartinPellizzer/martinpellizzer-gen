    "intro": "Borrichia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in the western United States and parts of South America. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Borrichia species are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs that thrive in sandy or rocky soils. They have adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making them resilient to coastal conditions."
