    "intro": "Bubonium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime habitats. Its structure is highly modified to reduce water loss and withstand harsh coastal conditions. Bubonium maritimum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
