    "intro": "Banisteria pentandra, commonly known as the arrowroot vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its roots are valued for their starchy texture, which resembles arrowroot, though they are not commonly used in modern cuisine. Banisteria pentandra is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
