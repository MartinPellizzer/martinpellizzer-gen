    "intro": "Bulbine sceletium, commonly known as the \"Kalahari sourgrass,\" is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
