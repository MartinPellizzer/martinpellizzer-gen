    "intro": "Bupleurum telonense, commonly known as the Telonese bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, known as umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
