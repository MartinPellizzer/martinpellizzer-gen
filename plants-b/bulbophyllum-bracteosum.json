    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bracteosum, commonly known as the bracteated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that are typically borne on long, slender inflorescences. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil."
