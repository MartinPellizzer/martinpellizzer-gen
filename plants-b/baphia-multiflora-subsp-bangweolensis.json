    "intro": "Baphia multiflora subsp. bangweolensis, commonly known as the Bangweol bushwillow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, greyish bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
