    "intro": "Brassica campestris subsp. biennis, commonly known as field mustard, is an annual flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, slender pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a common weed and a valuable source of biofuel."
