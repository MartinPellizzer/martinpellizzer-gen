    "intro": "Betonica pratensis, commonly known as greater betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its showy blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Betonica pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
