It features erect, branched stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in the summer months, which are arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Betonica officinalis var. montana has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported calming and healing properties."
