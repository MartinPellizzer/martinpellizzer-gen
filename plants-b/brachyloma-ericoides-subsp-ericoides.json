    "intro": "Brachyloma ericoides subsp. ericoides, commonly known as the heath brachyloma, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained sandy or rocky soils. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are usually grey-green in color, and it produces clusters of tiny, pink or red flowers in spring. It is often found in coastal regions and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
