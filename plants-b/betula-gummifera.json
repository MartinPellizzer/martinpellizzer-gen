    "intro": "Betula gummifera, commonly known as the gum birch, is a species of birch native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, white bark and small, rounded leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula gummifera produces small, catkin-like flowers and is known for its ability to exude a sticky, resinous substance from its bark. This resin has been used traditionally in various cultural and medicinal practices."
