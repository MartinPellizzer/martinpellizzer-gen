    "intro": "Bupleurum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a fibrous root system and upright, branched stems that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Bupleurum latifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
