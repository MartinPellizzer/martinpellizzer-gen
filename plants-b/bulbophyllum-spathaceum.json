    "intro": "Bulbophyllum spathaceum, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and striking white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding environment. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
