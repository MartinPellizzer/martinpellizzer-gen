    "intro": "Baccharis hemiptera, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrublands. It has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like surface and produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by birds. Baccharis hemiptera plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
