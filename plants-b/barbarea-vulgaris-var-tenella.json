    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris var. tenella, commonly known as the curled dock, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves make it a hardy species often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The curled dock is also valued in some regions for its edible leaves, which can be cooked like spinach."
