    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. typica, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, triangular, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and river valleys."
