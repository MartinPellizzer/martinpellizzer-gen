    "intro": "Betula alba var. torfacea, commonly known as the white birch with a distinctive bark pattern. This variant of the white birch is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, often revealing a contrasting yellowish or reddish inner bark. It is a deciduous tree that thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its unique bark makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks."
