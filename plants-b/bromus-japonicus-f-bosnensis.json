    "intro": "Bromus japonicus f. bosnensis, commonly known as the Bosnian false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a variant of the common brome, characterized by its slightly different morphology and habitat preferences. The plant typically grows in dry, open areas such as meadows and rocky soils. It has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous\u9896\u679c, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
