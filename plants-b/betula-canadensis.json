    "intro": "Betula canadensis, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored wood underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Betula canadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
