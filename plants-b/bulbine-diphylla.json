It features a short, stocky stem and two pairs of fleshy, opposite leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
