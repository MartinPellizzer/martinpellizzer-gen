    "intro": "Becium frutescens, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and dark, durable wood that is highly valued in traditional crafts and furniture-making. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in warm, humid climates. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in axillary inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its natural range."
