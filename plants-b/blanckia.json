It is characterized by its striking, often bi-colored flowers that range from white to pink and purple. The plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Blanckia species typically have lance-shaped leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like butterflies and hummingbirds.
