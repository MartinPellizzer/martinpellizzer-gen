    "intro": "Baccharis lapidosa, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-green, narrow leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Baccharis lapidosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
