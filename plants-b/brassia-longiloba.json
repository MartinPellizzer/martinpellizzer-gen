    "intro": "Brassia longiloba, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brassia longiloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
