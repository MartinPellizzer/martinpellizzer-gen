    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tortum, commonly known as the twisted bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, twisted inflorescence and vibrant, often colorful flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are typically broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps reduce water loss. Bulbophyllum tortum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking floral display."
