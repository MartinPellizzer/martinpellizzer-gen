    "intro": "Bulbophyllum waughense, commonly known as the Waugh's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical conditions. The flowers are often clustered at the base of the leaves, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
