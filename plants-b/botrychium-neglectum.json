    "intro": "Botrychium neglectum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, slender rhizome with a pair of opposite, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like formation on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium neglectum typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a relatively small plant, usually reaching heights of only a few centimeters, and is often found in regions with temperate climates."
