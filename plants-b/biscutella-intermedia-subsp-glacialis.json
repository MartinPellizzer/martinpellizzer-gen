    "intro": "Biscutella intermedia subsp. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
