    "intro": "Breynia amabilis, commonly known as the velvetleaf breynia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and purplish or reddish on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along forest edges. Breynia amabilis is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in tropical ecosystems."
