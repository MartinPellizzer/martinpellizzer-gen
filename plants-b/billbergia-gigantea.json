    "intro": "Billbergia gigantea, commonly known as the giant billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that can range from red to orange, often resembling flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. Its inflorescence is typically tall and branched, bearing small, white to yellowish flowers. Billbergia gigantea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
