    "intro": "Bulbophyllum modicum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal care. It is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its compact size and ornamental value."
