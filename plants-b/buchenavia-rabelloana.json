    "intro": "Buchenavia rabelloana, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in furniture and cabinetry. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
