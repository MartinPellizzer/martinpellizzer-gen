It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often reddish in color, distinguishing it from other brome species. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in regions with low precipitation. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
