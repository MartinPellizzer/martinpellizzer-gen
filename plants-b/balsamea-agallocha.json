    "intro": "Balsamea agallocha, commonly known as the stickyweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of North America. It features a rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. Balsamea agallocha is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
