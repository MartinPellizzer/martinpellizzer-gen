    "intro": "Bupleurum gerardi var. filicaule, commonly known as the broad-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and wildflower meadows."
