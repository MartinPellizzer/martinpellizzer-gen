    "intro": "Borreria tenella var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has a succulent, shrub-like growth habit with thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Borreria tenella var. coriacea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
