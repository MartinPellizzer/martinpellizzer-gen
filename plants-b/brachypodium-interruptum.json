    "intro": "Brachypodium interruptum, commonly known as purple false brome, is a grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
