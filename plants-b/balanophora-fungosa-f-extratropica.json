    "intro": "Balanophora fungosa f. extratropica, commonly known as the extratropical ghost flower, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of trees or shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, white, fleshy flowers that emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is considered a relic species with a very limited distribution. Due to its specialized habitat and ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
