    "intro": "Begonia bayae, commonly known as the Bayae begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
