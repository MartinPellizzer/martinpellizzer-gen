    "intro": "Betula alnus var. incana, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn golden in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and river valleys. Betula alnus var. incana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
