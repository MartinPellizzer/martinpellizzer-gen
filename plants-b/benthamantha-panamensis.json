    "intro": "Benthamantha panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian benthamantha, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often found in humid, tropical climates. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Benthamantha panamensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for small invertebrates."
