    "intro": "Bromus borianus, commonly known as the Borian brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus borianus is an important component of high-altitude vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
