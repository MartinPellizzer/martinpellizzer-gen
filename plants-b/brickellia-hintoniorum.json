    "intro": "Brickellia hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring or early summer. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native habitat."
