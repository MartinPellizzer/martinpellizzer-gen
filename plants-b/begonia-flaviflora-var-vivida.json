    "intro": "Begonia flaviflora var. vivida, commonly known as the Vivid Flame Begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, showy blooms."
