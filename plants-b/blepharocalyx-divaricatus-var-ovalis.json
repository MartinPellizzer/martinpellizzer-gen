    "intro": "Blepharocalyx divaricatus var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaf water apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round, fleshy fruits resembling small apples. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ornamental horticulture and tropical fruit cultivation. The varietal form 'ovalis' distinguishes it by its distinctly oval-shaped leaves compared to the standard variety."
