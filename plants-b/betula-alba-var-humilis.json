    "intro": "Betula alba var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small, deciduous shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of lakes. Betula alba var. humilis is a hardy species that can tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of boreal and tundra ecosystems."
