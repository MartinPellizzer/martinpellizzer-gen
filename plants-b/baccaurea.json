It consists of several species, many of which are cultivated for their edible, star-shaped fruits. The fruit's flesh is typically sweet and juicy, with a tart flavor, and it is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its botanical features include simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into the characteristic star-shaped fruit."
