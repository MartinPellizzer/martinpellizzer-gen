    "intro": "Bistorta pacifica f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, velvety, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, reddish-stemmed flowering stalks that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
