    "intro": "Boea lanata, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Boea lanata is also known for its edible berries, though they are generally not consumed due to their bitter taste."
