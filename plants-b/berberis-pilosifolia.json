    "intro": "Berberis pilosifolia, commonly known as the hairy barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for ornamental gardens. The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
