    "intro": "Blechnum alternans, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged alternately along the rachis. Blechnum alternans thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
