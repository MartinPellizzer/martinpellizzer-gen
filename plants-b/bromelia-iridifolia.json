    "intro": "Bromelia iridifolia, commonly known as the blue bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple foliage and striking inflorescence. The plant's leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, forming a central tank that collects rainwater, providing a microhabitat for small organisms. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, bloom for a short period and are followed by the production of berries. Bromelia iridifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in warm, humid environments."
