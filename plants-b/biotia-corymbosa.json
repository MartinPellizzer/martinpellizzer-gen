    "intro": "Biotia corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered biotia, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery, greenish-gray folioles that are closely clustered together. The plant produces apothecia that are typically pale yellow to orange, with a distinct margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
