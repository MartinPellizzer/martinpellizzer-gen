It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to several centimeters in length, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and dense foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a subtle yellow or greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
