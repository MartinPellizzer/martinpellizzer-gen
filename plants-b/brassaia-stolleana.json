    "intro": "Brassaia stolleana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, often followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. Brassaia stolleana is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
