    "intro": "Brassia cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, cinnamon-colored flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant belongs to the Epidendraceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Brassia cinnamomea thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
