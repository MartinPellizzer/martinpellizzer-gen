    "intro": "Bulbophyllum muriceum, commonly known as the mouse-ear orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often hairy foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, serving as storage organs for water and nutrients. The orchid's unique appearance and growth habits make it a popular choice for collectors and horticultural enthusiasts."
