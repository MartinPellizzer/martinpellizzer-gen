    "intro": "Banalia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf banalia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Banalia humilis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments."
