    "intro": "Begonia variegata, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia variegata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
