It features a short, thick rhizome with fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
