    "intro": "Brewstera, commonly known as false heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. These plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Brewstera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
