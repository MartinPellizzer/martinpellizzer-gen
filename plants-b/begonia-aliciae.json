    "intro": "Begonia aliciae, commonly known as the Alice begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It features velvety, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green hue and striking red veins, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
