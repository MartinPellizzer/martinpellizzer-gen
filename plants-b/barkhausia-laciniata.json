    "intro": "Barkhausia laciniata, commonly known as the lacebark tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, peeling, papery bark that reveals a mottled pattern of green, white, and brown as it ages. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Barkhausia laciniata is well-suited to coastal and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens."
