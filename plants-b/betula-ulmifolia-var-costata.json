    "intro": "Betula ulmifolia var. costata, commonly known as the smooth paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
