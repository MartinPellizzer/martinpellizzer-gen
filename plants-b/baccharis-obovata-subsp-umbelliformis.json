    "intro": "Baccharis obovata subsp. umbelliformis, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
