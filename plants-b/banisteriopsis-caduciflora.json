    "intro": "Banisteriopsis caduciflora, commonly known as the \"sensitive plant\" or \"touch-me-not,\" is a tropical vine belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonasty. Its small, white flowers are followed by bean-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
