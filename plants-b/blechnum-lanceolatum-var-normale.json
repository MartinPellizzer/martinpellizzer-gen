    "intro": "Blechnum lanceolatum var. normale, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, compact foliage that forms a rosette-like structure. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
