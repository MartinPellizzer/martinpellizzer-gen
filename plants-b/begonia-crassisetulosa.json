    "intro": "Begonia crassisetulosa, commonly known as the thicksettole begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
