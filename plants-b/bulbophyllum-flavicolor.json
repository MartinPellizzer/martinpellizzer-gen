    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flavicolor, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, yellowish-orange flowers with intricate patterns, often resembling lips, which attract pollinators. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted for efficient light absorption in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum flavicolor requires careful cultivation, including bright indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
