    "intro": "Bactris hirta subsp. pulchra, commonly known as the pink pineapple, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, waxy leaves that are often pink or red in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers, which eventually develop into edible fruits resembling pineapples. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
