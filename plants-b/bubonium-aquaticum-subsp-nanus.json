    "intro": "Bubonium aquaticum subsp. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf water bellflower, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and ribbon-like, adapted for efficient water absorption. This subspecies is notable for its compact size and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic biodiversity."
