    "intro": "Blechnum brasiliense f. multifida, commonly known as the Brazilian harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a deeply divided, multifid structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a rugged texture, with a central midrib and lateral pinnae that are often lobed or toothed. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
