    "intro": "Biscutella stenophylla var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed biscutella, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
