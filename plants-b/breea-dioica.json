    "intro": "Breea dioica, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish-green, fern-like leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Breea dioica has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
