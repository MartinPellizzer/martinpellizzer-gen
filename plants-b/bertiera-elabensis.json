    "intro": "Bertiera elabensis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its aromatic wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
