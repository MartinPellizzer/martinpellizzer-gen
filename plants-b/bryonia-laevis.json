    "intro": "Bryonia laevis, commonly known as the smooth bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange, spherical fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
