    "intro": "Bromus erectus f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often tinged with brown or purple. Its seeds are small and hardy, allowing it to persist in various environmental conditions. This form is a natural variant of Bromus erectus, distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form."
