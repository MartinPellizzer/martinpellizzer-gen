    "intro": "Billbergia nutans, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of waxy, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its leaves are often adorned with white or pink markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Billbergia nutans thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
