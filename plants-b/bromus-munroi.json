    "intro": "Bromus munroi, commonly known as Munro's brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus munroi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
