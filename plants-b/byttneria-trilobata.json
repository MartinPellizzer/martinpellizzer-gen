    "intro": "Byttneria trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
