    "intro": "Bridelia urticoides, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, similar to those found in true nettles. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually covered with a fine pubescence. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and the fruit is a capsule containing minute seeds. Bridelia urticoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
