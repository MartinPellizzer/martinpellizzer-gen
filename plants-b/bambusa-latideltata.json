The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Bambusa latideltata is also valued for its strong, lightweight culms, which are used in construction and crafts."
