    "intro": "Baccharis zoellneri subsp. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery or grayish underside, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that are arranged in clusters, typical of the genus Baccharis."
