    "intro": "Bulbophyllum riparium, commonly known as the river orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Bulbophyllum riparium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
