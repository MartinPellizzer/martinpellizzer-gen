    "intro": "Balanophora pedicellaris, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant features a fleshy, reddish stem and produces showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are covered in fine, root-like structures called haustoria, which help it attach to host plants. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
