    "intro": "Blechnum deltoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the edges. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly across the ground. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Blechnum deltoides prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
