    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tuberculatum, commonly known as the tuberculate orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-draining soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive pattern of markings. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Bulbophyllum tuberculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
