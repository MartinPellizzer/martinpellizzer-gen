    "intro": "Bauhinia affinis, commonly known as the white bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia affinis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
