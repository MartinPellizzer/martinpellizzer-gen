    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. daedaleum, commonly known as the fairy fan fern, is a delicate fern species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble a fan or a network of delicate threads. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
