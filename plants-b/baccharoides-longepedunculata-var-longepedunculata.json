    "intro": "Baccharoides longepedunculata var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long-pedunculate baccharoides, is a shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and taxonomic studies."
