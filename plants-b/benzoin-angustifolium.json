    "intro": "Benzoin angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved benzoin, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is known for secreting a resinous substance from its bark, which has been used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. The resin of Benzoin angustifolium is similar to that of other benzoin species but has distinct chemical properties."
