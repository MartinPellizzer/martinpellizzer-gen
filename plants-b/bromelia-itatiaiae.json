    "intro": "Bromelia itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Bromelia itatiaiae is also noted for its ability to support a diverse array of microfauna within its leaf axils."
