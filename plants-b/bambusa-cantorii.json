    "intro": "Bambusa cantorii, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with its dark green leaves. The plant is a clump-forming bamboo that can grow up to 10 meters in height, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomes are relatively weak, which makes it less invasive compared to other bamboo species. Bambusa cantorii thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it suitable for a variety of climates."
