    "intro": "Bromus giganteus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem, and its leaves are typically narrow and glabrous above. It thrives in open, disturbed sites and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Bromus giganteus var. villosus is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent component of many ecosystems."
