    "intro": "Bassia articulata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Bassia articulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
