    "intro": "Buchnerodendron laurentii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
