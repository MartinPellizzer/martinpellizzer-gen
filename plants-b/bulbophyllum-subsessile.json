    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subsessile, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, often hidden rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a potted plant."
