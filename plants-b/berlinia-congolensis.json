    "intro": "Berlinia congolensis, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a large deciduous tree native to central and western Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It is often found in moist lowland forests and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant also plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
