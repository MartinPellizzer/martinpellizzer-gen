    "intro": "Bissea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact, rosette-like growth habit and their showy, often brightly colored flowers. Bissea species typically have thick, waxy leaves that help them retain moisture in arid environments. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and blooms. The genus includes several species, such as Bissea glabrata, which is widely cultivated for its vibrant flowers and ease of care."
