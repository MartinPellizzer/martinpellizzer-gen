    "intro": "Begonia gigaphylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
