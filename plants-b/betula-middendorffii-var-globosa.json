    "intro": "Betula middendorffii var. globosa, commonly known as the globular birch, is a unique variant of the white birch species. It is characterized by its spherical, clustered growth habit, which forms dense, rounded colonies rather than individual trees. The plant has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, resembling the bark of other birch species. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is native to central Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and distinctive appearance."
