It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and its ability to form thick, tangled mats as it climbs. The plant produces striking clusters of small, fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. Banisteria bracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
