It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have smooth, often aromatic leaves and produce small, clustered flowers that can range in color from white to yellow. Baursea species are often shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense growth habit and ability to thrive in humid conditions. They are valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
