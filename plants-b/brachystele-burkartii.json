    "intro": "Brachystele burkartii, commonly known as the dwarf staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form. The plant features a thick, leathery frond that resembles a staghorn, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, porous media for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
