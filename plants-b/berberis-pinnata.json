    "intro": "Berberis pinnata, commonly known as prickly barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, each adorned with small, sharp spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping."
