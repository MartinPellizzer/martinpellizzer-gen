    "intro": "Beauprea balansae var. montana, commonly known as the mountain beauprea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
