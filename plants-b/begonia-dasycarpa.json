    "intro": "Begonia dasycarpa, commonly known as the hairy fruit begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that are borne on erect, slender stems. Its unique feature is the hairy, fleshy fruits that develop after flowering, which are often mistaken for ornamental berries. Begonia dasycarpa is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
