    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tahitense subsp. butaudianum, commonly known as the Tahitian ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Society Islands. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
