It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish-purple flowers and is part of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its bulbs are a defining feature, storing nutrients and water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
