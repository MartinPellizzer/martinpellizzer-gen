    "intro": "Begonia comestibilis, commonly known as the edible begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant is notable for its edible leaves, which are often used in local cuisines for their mild, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental and culinary value, it is sometimes cultivated in home gardens."
