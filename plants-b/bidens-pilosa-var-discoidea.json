    "intro": "Bidens pilosa var. discoidea, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by bristly, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
