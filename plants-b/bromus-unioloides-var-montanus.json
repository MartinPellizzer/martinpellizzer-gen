    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique morphological traits compared to other bromus species."
