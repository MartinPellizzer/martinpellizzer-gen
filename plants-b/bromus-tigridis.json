    "intro": "Bromus tigridis, commonly known as the tigrid grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, pale-green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray sheath. Bromus tigridis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
