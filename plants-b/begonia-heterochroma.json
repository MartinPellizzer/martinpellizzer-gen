    "intro": "Begonia heterochroma, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its unique foliage. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and exhibit a combination of green, white, and sometimes pink or red variegation. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom on slender stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia heterochroma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
