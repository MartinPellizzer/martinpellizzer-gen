    "intro": "Bignonia pachyptera, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Bignonia pachyptera is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
