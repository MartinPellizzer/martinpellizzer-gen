    "intro": "Batrachium peucedanifolium, commonly known as the purple thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed schizocarp, which splits into three parts when mature, each containing a single seed. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is considered a minor herb in traditional medicine."
