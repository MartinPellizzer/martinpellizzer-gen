It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The tree has a dense, rounded crown and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel, though it is also threatened by deforestation."
