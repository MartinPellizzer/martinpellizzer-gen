    "intro": "Berberis nummularia var. pyrocarpa, commonly known as the Pyrocarpa barberry, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, rounded foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive form and winter interest. Due to its hardiness, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
