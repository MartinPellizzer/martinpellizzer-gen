    "intro": "Brassica amplexicaulis f. cedrorum, commonly known as the Alpine cabbage, is a rare and frost-tolerant plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
