    "intro": "Blochmannia, commonly known as the symbiotic bacterium associated with leafcutter ants, is a genus of Gram-positive, endosymbiotic bacteria. These bacteria are essential for the nutrition of their host ants, particularly in the synthesis of essential amino acids. Blochmannia species are typically found within the specialized fungal gardens cultivated by leafcutter ants. They exhibit a high degree of genetic specialization, reflecting their long-term co-evolution with their hosts. The study of Blochmannia provides insights into the complex mutualistic relationships between insects and their microbial symbionts."
