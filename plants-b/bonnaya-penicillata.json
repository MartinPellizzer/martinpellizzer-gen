    "intro": "Bonnaya penicillata, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a striking range of colors, from white to pink and red. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the surface of the water, supported by long, fibrous stems. Its flowers are known to open at dawn and close at sunset, a behavior that has been observed for centuries. Bonnaya penicillata is also valued for its medicinal properties and holds cultural significance in Hindu and Buddhist traditions."
