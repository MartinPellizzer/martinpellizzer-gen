    "intro": "Bowlesia tropaeolifolia var. tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted bowlesia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct leaflets, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
