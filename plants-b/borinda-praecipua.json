    "intro": "Borinda praecipua, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a striking member of the Cyatheaceae family. It is native to the forests of New Zealand and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 15 meters in height, with a slow growth rate that makes it a long-lived species. Its spore-bearing cones are typically found at the base of the plant, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of Borinda praecipua make it a distinctive and ecologically important plant in its native habitat."
