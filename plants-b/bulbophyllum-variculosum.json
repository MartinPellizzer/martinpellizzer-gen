    "intro": "Bulbophyllum variculosum, commonly known as the swollen-veined orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry environments it inhabits. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species."
