    "intro": "Beta maritima var. erecta, commonly known as sea beet, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features sturdy, upright stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. The leaves are broad, fleshy, and often bluish-green, with a slightly ribbed texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
