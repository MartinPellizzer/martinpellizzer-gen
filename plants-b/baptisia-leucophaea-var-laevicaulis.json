    "intro": "Baptisia leucophaea var. laevicaulis, commonly known as the white false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of blue to white flowers in early summer. The plant has palmately divided, gray-green leaves that are hairy and often have a distinctive waxy coating. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for native gardens. Its seed pods, which develop after flowering, are cylindrical and split open to release small, dark seeds."
