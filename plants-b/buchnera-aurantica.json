    "intro": "Buchnera aurantica, commonly known as the golden leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Buchnera aurantica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
