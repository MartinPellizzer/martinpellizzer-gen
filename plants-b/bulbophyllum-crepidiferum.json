    "intro": "Bulbophyllum crepidiferum, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often hairy or ridged pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but remains rare in the wild."
