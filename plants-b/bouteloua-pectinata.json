    "intro": "Bouteloua pectinata, commonly known as hairy grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Hairy grama is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
