    "intro": "Betula papyrifera var. macrostachya, commonly known as the paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch tree native to North America. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and aesthetic value."
