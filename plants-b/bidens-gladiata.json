    "intro": "Bidens gladiata, commonly known as the swordleaf tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread along waterways. Bidens gladiata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
