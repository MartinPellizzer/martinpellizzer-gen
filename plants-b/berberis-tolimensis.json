    "intro": "Berberis tolimensis, commonly known as the Tolima barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
