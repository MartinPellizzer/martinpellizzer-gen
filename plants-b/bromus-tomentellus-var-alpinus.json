    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus var. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Bromus tomentellus var. alpinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and grasslands at elevations above 1,500 meters."
