    "intro": "Biscutella pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Biscutella pinnatifida is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cooler, alpine environments. Its name reflects its distinctive leaf shape and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
