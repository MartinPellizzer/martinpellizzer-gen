It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that often droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique form and flowering display."
