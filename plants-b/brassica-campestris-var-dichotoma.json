    "intro": "Brassica campestris var. dichotoma, commonly known as the wild mustard, is a flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its biennial growth cycle, with basal rosettes of leaves in the first year and flowering stems in the second. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and fields. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and agricultural weed management."
