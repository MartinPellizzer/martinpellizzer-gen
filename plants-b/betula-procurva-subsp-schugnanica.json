    "intro": "Betula procurva subsp. schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically oval to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a pointed tip. It produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
