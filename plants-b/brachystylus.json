    "intro": "Brachystylus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. They are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky and sandy soils. Brachystylus species are often found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's unique climate. The genus includes several species, each with distinct floral colors and growth habits."
