    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pumilio, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Bulbophyllum pumilio is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and ease of cultivation."
