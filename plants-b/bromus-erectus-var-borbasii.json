    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. borbasii, commonly known as the Borbasii brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. The seeds are small and mature in late summer, contributing to its role in ecological succession and soil stabilization."
