    "intro": "Bernardia mollis var. lanceifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf bernardia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are lanceolate, hence the variety name, and are typically thick and leathery to reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. It produces small, edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters."
