    "intro": "Bulbophyllum alcicorne, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white petals and deep red sepals, often with contrasting veining. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
