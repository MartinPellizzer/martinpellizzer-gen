It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that attract birds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and hardy nature."
