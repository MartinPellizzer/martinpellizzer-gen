    "intro": "Botrychium lanuginosum var. leptostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stalked moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It features a small, heart-shaped sorus that is covered in soft, velvety hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The fronds are typically divided into a basal rosette and a terminal, elongated stalk, which is a key identifying feature. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
