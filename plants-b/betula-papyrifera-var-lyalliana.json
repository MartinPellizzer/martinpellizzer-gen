This tree is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. The leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are an important food source for various wildlife species."
