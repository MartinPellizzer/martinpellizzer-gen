    "intro": "Betula pendula var. oycowiensis, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a variant of the European weeping willow. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect. The leaves are typically broad, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. This species thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes."
