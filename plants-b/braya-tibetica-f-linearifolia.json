    "intro": "Braya tibetica f. linearifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan rock-braya, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in early summer. It is native to high-altitude regions of Tibet and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
