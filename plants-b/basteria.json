It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a small shrub or herb, often with a compact, bushy appearance. Basteria species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flower colors and ability to thrive in indoor environments. They prefer bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
