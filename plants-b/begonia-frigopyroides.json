    "intro": "Begonia frigopyroides, commonly known as the alpine begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid mountainous habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Begonia frigopyroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
