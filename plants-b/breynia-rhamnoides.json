    "intro": "Breynia rhamnoides, commonly known as the fire tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark and leaves contain toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Breynia rhamnoides is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in traditional medicine."
