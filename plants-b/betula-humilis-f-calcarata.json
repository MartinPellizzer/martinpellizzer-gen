    "intro": "Betula humilis f. calcarata, commonly known as the dwarf birch or mountain birch, is a shrub-like variant of the birch genus native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, often forming dense thickets in alpine and subarctic regions. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually hairy, and it produces catkins that are a key feature of its reproductive system. It thrives in poor, acidic soils and is often found in open, exposed habitats. Betula humilis f. calcarata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine species."
