    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
