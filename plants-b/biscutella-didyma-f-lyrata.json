    "intro": "Biscutella didyma f. lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata biscuit flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its delicate, lyre-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle beauty to its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
