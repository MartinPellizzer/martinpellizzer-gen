    "intro": "Banksia meisneri subsp. ascendens, commonly known as the ascending banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the foliage, typically in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy texture. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
