It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with prominent yellow stamens, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
