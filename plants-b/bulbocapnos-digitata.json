It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
