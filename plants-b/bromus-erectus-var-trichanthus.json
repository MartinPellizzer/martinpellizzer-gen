    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. trichanthus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is characterized by its tufted growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
