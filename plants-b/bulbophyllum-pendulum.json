    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pendulum, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination."
