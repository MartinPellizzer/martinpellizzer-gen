    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 sandbergii f. maxima, commonly known as the white poplar, is a hybrid species within the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its smooth, white to gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks."
