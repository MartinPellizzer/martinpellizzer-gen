    "intro": "Barringtonia arborea, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The tree produces a unique fruit with a fibrous outer husk enclosing a hard, oily seed. Its leaves are large, simple, and opposite, often with a waxy surface. The plant has a shallow root system and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil."
