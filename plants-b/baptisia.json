Baptisia species are typically perennial, herbaceous plants that thrive in full sun and well-drained soil. They have compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produce pods that contain several seeds. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
