    "intro": "Beadlea multiflora, commonly known as the clustered beardtongue, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. Beadlea multiflora is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
