    "intro": "Bauhinia cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabeno bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, papilionaceous flowers that are typically pink or red in color, blooming during the dry season. Its fruit is a flat, leathery pod that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia cuyabensis is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
