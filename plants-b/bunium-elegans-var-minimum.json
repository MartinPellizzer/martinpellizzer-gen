    "intro": "Bunium elegans var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf bishop's weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically reaches a height of less than 10 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small white flowers appear in late spring and are followed by small, rounded fruits. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
