    "intro": "Bupleurum longeradiatum f. leveillei, commonly known as the slender leafed bupleurum, is a rare botanical variant native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is known for its aromatic properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
