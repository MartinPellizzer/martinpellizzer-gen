    "intro": "Billbergia vittata var. amabilis, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with pink or red hues along the edges. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
