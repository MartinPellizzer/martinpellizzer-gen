    "intro": "Brachyscome nivalis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It features dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late winter to early spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with silver-grey foliage that is covered in fine hairs, providing a frost-resistant structure. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its resilience to cold temperatures and ability to bloom in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
