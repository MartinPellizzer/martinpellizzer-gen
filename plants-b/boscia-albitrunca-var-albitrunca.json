The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round, fleshy fruits. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
