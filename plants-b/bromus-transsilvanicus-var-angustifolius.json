It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually greenish or purplish in color. This variety is characterized by its fine foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
