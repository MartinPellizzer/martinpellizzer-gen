    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pungens var. pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting orchid flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
