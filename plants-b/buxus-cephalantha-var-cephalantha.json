    "intro": "Buxus cephalantha var. cephalantha, commonly known as the purpleleaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a distinctive bluish-purple underside, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is often used as a topiary or hedge plant."
