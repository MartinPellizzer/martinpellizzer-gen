    "intro": "Bradleia lanceolaria, commonly known as the lanceleaf bradleia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are often violet or purple in color and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Bradleia lanceolaria is a relatively rare plant, and its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
