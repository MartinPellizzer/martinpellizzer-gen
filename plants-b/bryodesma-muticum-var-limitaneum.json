    "intro": "Bryodesma muticum var. limitaneum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curled at the edges. The plant exhibits a dark green coloration when fully hydrated, with a dense and compact growth habit. It is often found in rocky crevices or on the bark of trees in temperate regions. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and maintain its structure in humid microhabitats."
