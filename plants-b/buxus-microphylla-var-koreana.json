    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. koreana, commonly known as Korean boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Korea. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat shape make it ideal for hedges and topiaries."
