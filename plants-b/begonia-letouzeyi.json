    "intro": "Begonia letouzeyi, commonly known as the Letouzey's begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored foliage and showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a short, upright growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
