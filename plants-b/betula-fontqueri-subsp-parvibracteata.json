    "intro": "Betula fontqueri subsp. parvibracteata, commonly known as the Alaska birch, is a shrub-like member of the Betulaceae family native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, oval leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged nuts. Its bark is typically smooth and white, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers. This subspecies is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
