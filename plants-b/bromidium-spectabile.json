    "intro": "Bromidium spectabile, commonly known as the spectabile bromidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Bromidium spectabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
