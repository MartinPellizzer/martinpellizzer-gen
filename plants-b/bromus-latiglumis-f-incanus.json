It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged on the stem, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a prominent midrib. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
