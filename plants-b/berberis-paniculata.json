It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and vibrant seasonal color make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats."
