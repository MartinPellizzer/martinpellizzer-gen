    "intro": "Barosma ternata, commonly known as the coastal barosma, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Barosma ternata is an important component of fynbos vegetation and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
