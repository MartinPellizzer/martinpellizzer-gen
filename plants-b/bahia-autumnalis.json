    "intro": "Bahia autumnalis, commonly known as autumn bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the fall, adding ornamental value to landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and well-suited for erosion control in sandy or loamy soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable groundcover in native plant gardens."
