    "intro": "Bertya linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bertya, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
