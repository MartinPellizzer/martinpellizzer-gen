    "intro": "Bondtia santalina, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant is hemi-parasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized roots. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically white or pale yellow. The tree is also known for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a rare and precious species in its native habitat."
