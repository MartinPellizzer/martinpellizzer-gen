    "intro": "Begonia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or over surfaces. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and vibrant green color. Its flowers are typically pink or red, borne in clusters at the leaf axils. Begonia procumbens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative ground cover."
