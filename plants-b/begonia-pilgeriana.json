    "intro": "Begonia pilgeriana, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded borders. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
