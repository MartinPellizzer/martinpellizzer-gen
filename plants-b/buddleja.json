    "intro": "Buddleja, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a genus of about 120 species of flowering plants in the family Oleaceae. These shrubs are native to Asia, Europe, and North America, and they are characterized by their showy, panicle-like inflorescences that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. The flowers are usually clustered in elongated spikes, with tubular or bell-shaped blooms that range in color from white to purple. Buddleja species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
