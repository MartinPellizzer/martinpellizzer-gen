    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are broad and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in early spring and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds."
