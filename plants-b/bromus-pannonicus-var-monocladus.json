    "intro": "Bromus pannonicus var. monocladus, commonly known as the single-leaf brome, is a perennial grass native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to brown, with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and semi-natural environments."
