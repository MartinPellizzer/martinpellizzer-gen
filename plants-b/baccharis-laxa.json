    "intro": "Baccharis laxa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and desert regions. Baccharis laxa is also known for its aromatic leaves, which can be used in traditional herbal remedies."
