    "intro": "Blechnum lineare, commonly known as the linear harts tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a harts tongue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
