    "intro": "Botrychium rutifolium var. robustum, commonly known as the robust lady's-tongue, is a fern-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, tongue-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the base of the fronds. Botrychium rutifolium var. robustum is often found in association with other early-successional plants in disturbed or wet habitats."
