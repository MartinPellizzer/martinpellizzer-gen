    "intro": "Betula incana, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and orange underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a serrated margin, and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula incana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks."
