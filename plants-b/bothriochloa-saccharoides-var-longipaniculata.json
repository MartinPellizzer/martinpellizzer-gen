    "intro": "Bothriochloa saccharoides var. longipaniculata, commonly known as the long-panicled bluestem, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces panicles that are elongated and branched, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
