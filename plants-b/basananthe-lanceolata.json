    "intro": "Basananthe lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered, with male and female flowers separated on the spadix, a feature common in the Araceae family. Basananthe lanceolata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
