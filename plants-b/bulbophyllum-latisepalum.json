    "intro": "Bulbophyllum latisepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces large, showy flowers with broad, often colorful sepals and petals. It typically blooms in the summer months, and its growth habit is epiphytic or lithophytic, depending on the environment. The botanical features of this orchid make it a popular choice for both horticultural and conservation studies."
