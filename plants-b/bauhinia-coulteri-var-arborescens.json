    "intro": "Bauhinia coulteri var. arborescens, commonly known as the purple wisteria, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple-pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in some regions."
