    "intro": "Buxus balearica f. acutifolia, commonly known as the acute-leaved boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with lance-shaped, pointed leaves that are typically 1\u20132 cm in length. The plant has a slow growth rate, making it ideal for topiary and formal garden designs. Its small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers appear in spring, followed by red-brown berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
