    "intro": "Blepharodon adenopogon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
