    "intro": "Boehmeria grandis var. cuneata, commonly known as the Chinese nettle or giant nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous, hollow stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, and its leaves are often covered with fine hairs. It is valued for its strong, durable fibers, which have been traditionally used in textile and paper manufacturing. This variant is distinguished by its cuneate (wedge-shaped) leaf base, setting it apart from other varieties of Boehmeria."
