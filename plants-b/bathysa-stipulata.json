    "intro": "Bathysa stipulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Bathysa stipulata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
