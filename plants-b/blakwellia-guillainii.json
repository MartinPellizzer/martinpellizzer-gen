    "intro": "Blakwellia guillainii, commonly known as the Cape York lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rainforest flora. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered fruits that disperse its seeds through wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Blakwellia guillainii is considered a vulnerable species."
