    "intro": "Bupariti rehmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
