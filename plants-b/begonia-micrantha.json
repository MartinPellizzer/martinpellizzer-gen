    "intro": "Begonia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and modest blooms, which appear throughout the growing season. Begonia micrantha is also appreciated for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
