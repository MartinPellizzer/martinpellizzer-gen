    "intro": "Begonia malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green or reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in the summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
