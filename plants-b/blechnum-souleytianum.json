    "intro": "Blechnum souleytianum, commonly known as the giant cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on rocky outcrops or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to steep or vertical surfaces. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance that makes it a striking ornamental plant."
