It features striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
