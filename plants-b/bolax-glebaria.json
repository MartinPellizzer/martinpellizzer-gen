    "intro": "Bolax glebaria, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Bolax glebaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
