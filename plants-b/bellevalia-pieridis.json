    "intro": "Bellevalia pieridis, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Bellevalia pieridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
