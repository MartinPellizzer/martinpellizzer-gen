    "intro": "Berberis sargentiana, commonly known as Sargent's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny branches and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Berberis sargentiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
