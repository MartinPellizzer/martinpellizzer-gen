    "intro": "Bryobium eriaeoides, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is often found in shaded, humid environments such as tropical rainforests. The plant has small, intricate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Bryobium eriaeoides is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks, and it requires high levels of moisture and indirect light to thrive. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
