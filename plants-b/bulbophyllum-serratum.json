    "intro": "Bulbophyllum serratum, commonly known as the serrated bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its leaves are usually fleshy and dark green, while the flowers are small and often fragrant. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
