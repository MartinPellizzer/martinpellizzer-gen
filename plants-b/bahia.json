    "intro": "Bahia, commonly known as common bermuda grass, is a perennial grass native to the warm climates of the Americas. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green blades and its ability to form a dense, mat-like turf. Bahia grass thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for lawns in southern regions. It has a shallow root system and is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and hardiness. The plant is also valued for its low maintenance requirements and adaptability to various soil types."
