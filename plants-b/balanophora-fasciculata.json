    "intro": "Balanophora fasciculata, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in fascicles, giving it its scientific name. Its roots are highly specialized, forming haustoria to penetrate the host's vascular system. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in certain ecosystems by influencing the growth of its host plants."
