It is a deciduous climbing vine characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Bignonia spathacea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or structures."
