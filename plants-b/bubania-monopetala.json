    "intro": "Bubania monopetala, commonly known as the single-flower bubania, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its solitary, showy flower that typically blooms in bright yellow or orange. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
