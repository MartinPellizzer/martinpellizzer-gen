It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its inflorescence consists of multiple fragrant, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
