    "intro": "Bulbophyllum thomense, commonly known as the Thom's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Bulbophyllum thomense is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
