    "intro": "Baphia pynaertii, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
