    "intro": "Biscutella auriculata var. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy, branched stems and basal leaves that are typically kidney-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. Its leaves are often lobed and have a distinctive emarginate (notched) base, giving it its specific epithet. This species is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
