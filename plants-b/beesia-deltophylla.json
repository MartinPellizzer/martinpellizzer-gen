    "intro": "Beesia deltophylla, commonly known as the mountain bee plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open, sunny environments such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Beesia deltophylla is valued in horticulture for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
