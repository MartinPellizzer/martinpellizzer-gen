It is a member of the Onagraceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Blepharis bequaertii is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal rainfall."
