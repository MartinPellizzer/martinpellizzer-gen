    "intro": "Bromus stamineus, commonly known as the staminate brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and covered with short hairs, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Bromus stamineus is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
