    "intro": "Benstonea elostigma, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its specialized leaves. Benstonea elostigma thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
