    "intro": "Bignonia nigricans, commonly known as the crossvine, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a red throat, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important nectar source. Bignonia nigricans thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
