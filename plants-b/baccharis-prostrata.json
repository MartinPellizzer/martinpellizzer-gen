    "intro": "Baccharis prostrata, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune habitats. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems. Baccharis prostrata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing dunes."
