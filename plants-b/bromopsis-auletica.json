    "intro": "Bromopsis auletica, commonly known as the alpine feather grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, feather-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It is often found in mountainous areas where it forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
