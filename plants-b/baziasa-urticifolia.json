    "intro": "Baziasa urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and it is known for its stinging hairs that cause skin irritation upon contact. Native to temperate regions, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in woodland areas. Despite its defensive properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
