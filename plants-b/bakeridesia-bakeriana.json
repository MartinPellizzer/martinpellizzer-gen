    "intro": "Bakeridesia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its elegant, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
