It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Bertiera breviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal blooms."
