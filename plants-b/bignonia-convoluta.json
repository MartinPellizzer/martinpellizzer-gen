    "intro": "Bignonia convoluta, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia convoluta is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
