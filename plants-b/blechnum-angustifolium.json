    "intro": "Blechnum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually arranged in a compact rosette, with the fertile fronds bearing spore-producing structures on the underside."
