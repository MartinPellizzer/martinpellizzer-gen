    "intro": "Braya arctica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to cold and dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is extensive, helping it anchor in rocky or barren soils. Braya arctica is well-suited to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
