    "intro": "Bulbophyllum falcatocaudatum, commonly known as the sword-tailed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, sword-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with long, slender sepals and petals. It thrives in high humidity and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
