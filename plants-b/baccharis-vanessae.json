    "intro": "Baccharis vanessae, commonly known as velvetleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
