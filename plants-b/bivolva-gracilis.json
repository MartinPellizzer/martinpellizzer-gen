    "intro": "Bivolva gracilis, commonly known as the slender bivalve, is a species of sea snail belonging to the family Eulimidae. It is characterized by its small, elongated shell that is typically smooth and glossy. The shell is usually pale in color, with a slight spiral structure that becomes more pronounced as the snail matures. This species is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, often inhabiting coral reefs and rocky substrates. Its diet primarily consists of algae, which it scrapes from surfaces using its radula."
