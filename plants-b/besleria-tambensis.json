    "intro": "Besleria tambensis, commonly known as the Tamborica, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it thrives by attaching itself to other plants, often in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Besleria tambensis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for when provided with the right growing conditions."
