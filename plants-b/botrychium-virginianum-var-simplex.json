    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. simplex, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a delicate, fern-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, helmet-shaped arrangement on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its simple, unbranched fronds, distinguishing it from other varieties of the species."
