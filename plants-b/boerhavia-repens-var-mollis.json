    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. mollis, commonly known as velvetleaf purslane, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to warm climates. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, gardens, and along roadsides. Its adaptability and drought tolerance make it a common weed in many regions."
