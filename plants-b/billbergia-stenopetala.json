    "intro": "Billbergia stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled billbergia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia stenopetala is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
