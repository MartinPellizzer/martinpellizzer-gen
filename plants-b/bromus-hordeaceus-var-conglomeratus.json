    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. conglomeratus, commonly known as the clustered brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
