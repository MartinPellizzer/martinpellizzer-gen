    "intro": "Banksia armata, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or bottle-shaped flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia armata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It plays an important role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
