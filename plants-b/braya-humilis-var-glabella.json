    "intro": "Braya humilis var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually hairless, giving it the \"glabella\" designation, which refers to the smooth, bare appearance of its foliage. This species is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
