    "intro": "Blechnum brevifolium var. valdiviense, commonly known as the Valdivian shield fern, is a species native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds."
