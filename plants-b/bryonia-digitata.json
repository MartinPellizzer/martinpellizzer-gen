It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in arid environments. The plant features thick, waxy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a green, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, containing toxic seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in gardens and requires caution when handling."
