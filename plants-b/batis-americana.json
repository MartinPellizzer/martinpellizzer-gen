    "intro": "Batis americana, commonly known as American batis, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the summer months. Batis americana is valued for its ability to thrive in moist environments and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
