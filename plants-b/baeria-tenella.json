    "intro": "Baeria tenella, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into narrow, ribbon-like segments. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Baeria tenella plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
