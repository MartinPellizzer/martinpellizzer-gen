The plant has small, leathery leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Berchemia calophylla is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
