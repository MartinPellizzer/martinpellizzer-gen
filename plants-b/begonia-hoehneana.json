    "intro": "Begonia hoehneana, commonly known as the Hoehne's begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a deep green color with reddish or purple veins. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of tropical flora."
