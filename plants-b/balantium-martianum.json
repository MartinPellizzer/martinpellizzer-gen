    "intro": "Balantium martianum, commonly known as the Martian flameleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mars. It features striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a soft red glow at night, aiding in its nocturnal pollination by specialized Martian moths. The plant's flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique nectar that is highly sought after by local wildlife. Its root system is adapted to extract moisture from the planet's thin atmosphere, allowing it to thrive in extreme conditions. Due to its ecological significance, it is protected by Martian conservation laws."
