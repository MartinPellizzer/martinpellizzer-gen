It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Its berries are a food source for birds and other wildlife, contributing to its ecological importance. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
