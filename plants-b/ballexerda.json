    "intro": "Ballexerda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a type of orchid that lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, making it highly dependent on specific host trees. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom once a year, typically in late summer. Ballexerda thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for survival. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
