    "intro": "Blechnum malaccense, commonly known as the Malacca holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, upright growth habit. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
