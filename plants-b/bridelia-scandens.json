    "intro": "Bridelia scandens, commonly known as the climbing bridelia, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and entangle other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly toothed margin. Bridelia scandens is also noted for its fruit, which develops into a fleshy, red berry containing several seeds."
