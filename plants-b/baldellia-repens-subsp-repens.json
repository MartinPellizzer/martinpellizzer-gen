    "intro": "Baldellia repens subsp. repens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often floating or submerged depending on water levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
