    "intro": "Bouteloua brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, fluffy seeds. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
