    "intro": "Baccharis complanata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the late spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and scrublands. Baccharis complanata is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in some indigenous cultures for medicinal purposes."
