    "intro": "Buprestis arborescens, commonly known as the tree buprestid, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Buprestidae, which are commonly referred to as jewel beetles. It is characterized by its metallic green or blue exoskeleton, which often displays iridescent colors under light. The larvae of this species typically develop in decaying wood, playing a role in the decomposition process within forest ecosystems. The adult beetles are often found on trees or shrubs, where they feed on leaves or bark. Due to its ecological role and striking appearance, Buprestis arborescens is of interest to both entomologists and conservationists."
