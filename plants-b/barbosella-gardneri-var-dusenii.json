    "intro": "Barbosella gardneri var. dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's barbosella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinct aromatic scent, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
