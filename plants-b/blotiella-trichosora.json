    "intro": "Blotiella trichosora, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in muddy or sandy substrates. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
