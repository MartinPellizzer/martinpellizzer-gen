    "intro": "Brickellia reniformis, commonly known as the Texas brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture and a distinctive reddish-brown coloration. Brickellia reniformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
