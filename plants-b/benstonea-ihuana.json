    "intro": "Benstonea ihuana, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kahikatea. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries, which are usually red or yellow, contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Despite its parasitic nature, Benstonea ihuana plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
