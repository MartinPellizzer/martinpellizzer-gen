    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 rosendahlii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Betula pendula and Betula jacquemontii. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, often revealing a yellowish or reddish inner layer. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental tree in temperate climates. Betula \u00d7 rosendahlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
