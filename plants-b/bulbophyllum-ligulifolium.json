    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ligulifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
