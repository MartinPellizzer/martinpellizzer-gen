    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mystax, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hairy sepals and a prominent, showy lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. The orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity for optimal growth."
