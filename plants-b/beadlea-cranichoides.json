    "intro": "Beadlea cranichoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed beadlea, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forest habitats. Beadlea cranichoides is notable for its unique morphology and is considered a specialist species with limited geographic distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival."
