    "intro": "Baccharis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
