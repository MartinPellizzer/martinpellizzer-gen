It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
