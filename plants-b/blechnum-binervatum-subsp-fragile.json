    "intro": "Blechnum binervatum subsp. fragile, commonly known as the fragile maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense mat of foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, bipinnate leaves and a more fragile structure compared to other members of the species."
