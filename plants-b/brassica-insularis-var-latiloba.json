    "intro": "Brassica insularis var. latiloba, commonly known as the giant rockcress, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are broad and lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by round, edible pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean-style gardens."
