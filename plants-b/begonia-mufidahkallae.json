It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
