It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
