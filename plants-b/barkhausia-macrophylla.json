    "intro": "Barkhausia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant barkhausa, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture that distinguishes it in the landscape. Barkhausia macrophylla is well adapted to dry conditions and is often used in coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
