    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent annual brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Bromus. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are clustered at the base, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in pioneer succession."
