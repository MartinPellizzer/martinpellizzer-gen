    "intro": "Byrsonima arthropoda, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Rhizophora mangle*, is a tropical tree belonging to the Myrtaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive aerial roots, which help stabilize the tree in coastal and brackish water environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by water. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy surface, adapted to withstand saline conditions."
