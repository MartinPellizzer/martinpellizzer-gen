    "intro": "Borago spinulosa, commonly known as the Spanish flax or prickly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Borago spinulosa is sometimes used in herbal remedies, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other members of the Boraginaceae family."
