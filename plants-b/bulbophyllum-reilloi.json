    "intro": "Bulbophyllum reilloi, commonly known as the Red-bellied Pterostylis, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its striking red and green coloration on the leaves. The plant produces a single, downward-facing flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum reilloi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its role in local ecosystems."
