    "intro": "Brassia wyllisiana, commonly known as the Willis's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often dry or seasonally wet habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Brassia wyllisiana is valued in horticulture for its beauty and is often cultivated as a flowering plant in gardens and greenhouses."
