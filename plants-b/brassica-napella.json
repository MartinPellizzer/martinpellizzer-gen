    "intro": "Brassica napella, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, toothed leaves and tall, branched stems that bear small, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces long, slender siliques that contain numerous seeds. It is native to Europe and western Asia but has been naturalized in many other regions. Brassica napella is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in supporting pollinators."
