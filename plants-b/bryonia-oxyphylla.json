    "intro": "Bryonia oxyphylla, commonly known as the white bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to orange or red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, making it a plant with both medicinal and cautionary significance in botanical studies."
