    "intro": "Bismarckia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa. It features a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath. The plant has large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Bismarckia species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. These plants are slow-growing and can live for many decades, making them long-lived and rare in cultivation."
