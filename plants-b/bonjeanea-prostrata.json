    "intro": "Bonjeanea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bonjeanea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent central stamen. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Bonjeanea prostrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
