    "intro": "Bidens mollifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow with dark central disks, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. This variant is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy appearance compared to the typical Bidens mollifolia."
