    "intro": "Bacopa pubescens, commonly known as water bead or Indian pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Asia. It features tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds or wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective water purifier and a popular choice for aquariums."
