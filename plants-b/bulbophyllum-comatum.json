    "intro": "Bulbophyllum comatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the substrate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
