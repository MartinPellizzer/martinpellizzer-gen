    "intro": "Butonica apiculata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Butonica apiculata is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh conditions."
