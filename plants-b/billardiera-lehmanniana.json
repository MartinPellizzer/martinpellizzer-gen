    "intro": "Billardiera lehmanniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Billardiera lehmanniana is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats, where it forms a unique ecological relationship with its host."
