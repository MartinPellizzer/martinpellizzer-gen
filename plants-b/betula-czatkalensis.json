    "intro": "Betula czatkalensis, commonly known as the Czatkal birch, is a species of birch native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It thrives in cold, mountainous regions and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
