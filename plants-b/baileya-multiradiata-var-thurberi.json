    "intro": "Baileya multiradiata var. thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber's bush sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant has a low-growing, shrub-like structure with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other sunflower and daisy species. This variety is particularly adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
