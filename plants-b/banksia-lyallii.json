    "intro": "Banksia lyallii, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically golden yellow in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia lyallii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife."
