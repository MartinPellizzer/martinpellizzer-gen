    "intro": "Balsamea aprevalii, commonly known as the mountain balsam, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils. Balsamea aprevalii is valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including the treatment of skin irritations and respiratory ailments."
