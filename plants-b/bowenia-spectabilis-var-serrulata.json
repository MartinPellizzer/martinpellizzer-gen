    "intro": "Bowenia spectabilis var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated bowenia, is a rare and striking cycad native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are distinctly serrated along the margins, giving it its common name. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with a crown of leaves that can reach several meters in height. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a prized specimen in botanical collections. The species is also notable for its historical significance in the study of ancient plant evolution."
