    "intro": "Bromus asper var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with rough, hairy surfaces, and its inflorescence consists of a single spike of dense, spikelet-like clusters. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, and the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bromus asper var. pauciflorus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
