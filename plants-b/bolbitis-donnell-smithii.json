    "intro": "Bolbitis donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Dryopteridaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis donnell-smithii is considered a species of conservation concern."
