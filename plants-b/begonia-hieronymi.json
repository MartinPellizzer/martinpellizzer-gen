    "intro": "Begonia hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a vibrant, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
