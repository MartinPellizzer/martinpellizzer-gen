    "intro": "Beilschmiedia paulocordata, commonly known as the red-stemmed beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
