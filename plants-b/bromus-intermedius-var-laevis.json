    "intro": "Bromus intermedius var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and dense growth habit, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with leathery, awned glumes. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it reproduces through both seed and rhizome propagation. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in erosion control and forage production."
