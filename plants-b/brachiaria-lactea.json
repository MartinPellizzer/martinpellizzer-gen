    "intro": "Brachiaria lactea, commonly known as the milky stoloniferous grass, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with nodes that root and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences and has pale green to silver-colored foliage. Its milky sap, which is viscous and often latex-like, is a distinguishing feature. Brachiaria lactea is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage or erosion control."
