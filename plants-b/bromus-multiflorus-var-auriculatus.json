    "intro": "Bromus multiflorus var. auriculatus, commonly known as the auriculate brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and the presence of auriculate (ear-like) leaf sheaths, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brown flowers. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
