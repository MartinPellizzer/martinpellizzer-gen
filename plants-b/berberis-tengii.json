    "intro": "Berberis tengii, commonly known as the Tibetan barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. Berberis tengii is adapted to high-altitude environments and can thrive in rocky soils. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it of interest in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
