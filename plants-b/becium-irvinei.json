    "intro": "Becium irvinei, commonly known as the Irvine's becium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
