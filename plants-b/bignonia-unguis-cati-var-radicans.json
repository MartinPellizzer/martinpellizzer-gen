It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a decorative ground cover."
