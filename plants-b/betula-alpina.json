    "intro": "Betula alpina, commonly known as the Alpine birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and grayish-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Betula alpina is adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations."
