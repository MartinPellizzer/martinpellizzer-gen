    "intro": "Betula wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and smooth, white bark that peels in thin strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
