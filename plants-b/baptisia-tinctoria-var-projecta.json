It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to violet pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Baptisia tinctoria var. projecta is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
