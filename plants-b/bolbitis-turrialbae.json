    "intro": "Bolbitis turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, humid areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora. Due to habitat loss and limited research, the conservation status of Bolbitis turrialbae remains uncertain."
