    "intro": "Begonia compta, commonly known as the compact begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
