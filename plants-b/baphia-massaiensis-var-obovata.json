It is characterized by its obovate leaves, which are broad and rounded at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
