    "intro": "Blechnum mochaenum var. achalense, commonly known as the Achal\u00e1n fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at higher elevations. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
