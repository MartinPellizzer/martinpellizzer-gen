    "intro": "Bulbostylis annua, commonly known as the annual bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or disturbed areas. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in humid environments."
