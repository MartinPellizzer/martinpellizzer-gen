    "intro": "Bulbophyllum latibrachiatum var. epilosum, commonly known as the broad-armed bletilla, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant, flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
