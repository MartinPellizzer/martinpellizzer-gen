    "intro": "Banisteria crotonifolia, commonly known as the red-veined or red-leafed begonia, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a deep red or maroon coloration, often with contrasting green veins. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Banisteria crotonifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and is popular in tropical gardens."
