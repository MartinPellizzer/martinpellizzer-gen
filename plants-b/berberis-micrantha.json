    "intro": "Berberis micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
