    "intro": "Begonia chiriquensis, commonly known as the Chiriqu\u00ed begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the warm season. Begonia chiriquensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific tropical conditions."
