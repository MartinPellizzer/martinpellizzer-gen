    "intro": "Bromus rigidus f. asperipes, commonly known as the rough brome, is a grass species characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and coarse, rigid leaves. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides, across temperate regions. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each bearing two to three florets. Its seeds are small, smooth, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its adaptability. The plant's morphology reflects its ability to thrive in challenging environments, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
