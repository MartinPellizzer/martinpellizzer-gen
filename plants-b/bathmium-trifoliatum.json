It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
