    "intro": "Byrsella velella, commonly known as the common sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in coastal areas. It forms dense, turfs of bright green, ribbon-like blades that often grow on rocky substrates. The plant is characterized by its simple, undifferentiated structure, lacking true roots, stems, or leaves. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores released into the water to colonize new areas. Byrsella velella plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
