    "intro": "Begonia megapteroidea, commonly known as the giant winged begonia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
