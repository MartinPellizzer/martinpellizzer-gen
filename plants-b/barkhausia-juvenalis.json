It features small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
