    "intro": "Bulbophyllum parvulum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and compact size make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
