    "intro": "Bromus multiflorus var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, and its inflorescence is typically a panicle. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Velvet brome is valued for its erosion control capabilities and forage value for livestock."
