    "intro": "Betula pumila subsp. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive white or yellowish color. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. This subspecies is adapted to wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs or along stream banks."
