    "intro": "Brachystele rosilloana, commonly known as the Rosillo's stunted fern, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, short-stemmed structure. The plant features delicate, often dichotomously branched fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help in reducing water loss in its often arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
