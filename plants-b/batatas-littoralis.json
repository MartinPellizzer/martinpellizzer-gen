    "intro": "Batatas littoralis, commonly known as the coastal sweet potato, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and is well adapted to saline conditions. The plant produces tuberous roots that are rich in carbohydrates and have a sweet, nutty flavor. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are fibrous and can grow quite long. This species is valued both for its edible roots and its role in traditional agriculture in coastal communities."
