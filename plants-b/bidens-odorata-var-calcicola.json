    "intro": "Bidens odorata var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola ironweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its ability to tolerate calcium-rich soils, which gives it its specific epithet \"calcicola.\""
