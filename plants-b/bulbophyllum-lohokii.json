    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lohokii, commonly known as the Lohokii orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a dense inflorescence. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
