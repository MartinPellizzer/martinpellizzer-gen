    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. grossus, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with rough, hairy leaves that are often broader than those of the typical bromus species. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually clustered in pairs. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
