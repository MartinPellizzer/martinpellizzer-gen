    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ambrosia subsp. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepalese ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in high-altitude, shaded environments with cool, moist conditions. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its challenging habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
