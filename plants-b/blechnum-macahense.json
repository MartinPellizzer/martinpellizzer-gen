    "intro": "Blechnum macahense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce new fronds from the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typically near the tips. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
