    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leontoglossum, commonly known as the \"lion's tongue orchid,\" is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, sword-shaped leaves and striking, often red or orange, flowers that resemble a lion's tongue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its roots form a dense network, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Bulbophyllum leontoglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant floral display."
