    "intro": "Bursa anglica, commonly known as the English bur or bladder campion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble small bladders. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are pink or white, with five petals, and it produces numerous small, round seeds enclosed in the characteristic burs. Bursa anglica is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and tenacious seed dispersal."
