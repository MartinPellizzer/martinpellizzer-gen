    "intro": "Bulbophyllum incisilabrum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss. This orchid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
