    "intro": "Benthamia herminioides subsp. typica, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils. The species is notable for its resilience to drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments."
