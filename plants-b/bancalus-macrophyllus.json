    "intro": "Bancalus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant water beetle, is a species of aquatic beetle belonging to the family Dytiscidae. It is characterized by its large, robust body and strong legs adapted for swimming in freshwater habitats. The beetle's elytra are typically dark-colored and provide protection for its soft abdomen. It is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams where it feeds on small aquatic invertebrates. The plant-related aspects of this species are minimal, as it is not associated with any specific plant species but relies on aquatic vegetation for shelter and breeding sites."
