    "intro": "Beta pumila, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or white, followed by small, round berries. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal water availability. Beta pumila is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy, drought-resistant characteristics."
