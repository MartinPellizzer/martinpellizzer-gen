    "intro": "Begonia friburgensis, commonly known as the Friburg begonia, is a tropical plant native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
