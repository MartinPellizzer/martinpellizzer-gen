    "intro": "Byttneria urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging glory or stinging nettle tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, stinging hairs on its leaves and stems, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The plant thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed soils or near water sources."
