It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
