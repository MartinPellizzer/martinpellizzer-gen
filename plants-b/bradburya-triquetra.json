    "intro": "Bradburya triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Bradburya triquetra has a compact growth habit with a short rhizome and is often found in association with other rare plant species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
