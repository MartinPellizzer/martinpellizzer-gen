    "intro": "Banisteria helicina, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supports in a spiral formation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Banisteria helicina is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical settings."
