    "intro": "Betula crenata, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and cream. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Betula crenata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
