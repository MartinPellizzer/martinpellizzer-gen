    "intro": "Baphia hylophila, commonly known as the African senna, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a legume pod containing several seeds. Baphia hylophila is typically found in open woodland and grassland habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
