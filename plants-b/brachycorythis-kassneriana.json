    "intro": "Brachycorythis kassneriana, commonly known as the Kassner's narrow-leaf cycad, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like structure with thick, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and strap-shaped. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
