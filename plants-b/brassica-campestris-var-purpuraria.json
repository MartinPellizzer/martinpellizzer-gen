    "intro": "Brassica campestris var. purpuraria, commonly known as purple sprouting broccoli, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its dense, compact inflorescences that develop a deep purple hue. It is a biennial plant, though it is often grown as an annual in temperate climates, with the main harvest occurring in early spring. The plant features large, waxy leaves that are typically dark green, and its flowering stems are covered in small, cabbage-like buds. It thrives in cool weather and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its nutritional content and is commonly used in both culinary and ornamental applications."
