    "intro": "Brassia cryptophthalma, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a rhizome that produces a series of pseudobulbs. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Brassia cryptophthalma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
