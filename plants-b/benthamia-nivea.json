    "intro": "Benthamia nivea, commonly known as the white benthamia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Benthamia nivea is a perennial herb that blooms in the summer months, adding a delicate touch of white to mountainous landscapes."
