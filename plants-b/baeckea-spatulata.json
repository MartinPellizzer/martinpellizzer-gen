    "intro": "Baeckea spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf baeckea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy green leaves that are often broader than they are long. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Baeckea spatulata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
