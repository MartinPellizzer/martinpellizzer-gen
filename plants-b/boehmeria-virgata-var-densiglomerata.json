    "intro": "Boehmeria virgata var. densiglomerata, commonly known as the dense glomerate nettle, is a perennial herb native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, characterized by its stinging hairs that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a rough, hairy surface and prominent veins, while the inflorescences are dense, clustered clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its fibrous stems, which can be processed into textiles."
