    "intro": "Blepharis setosa, commonly known as the hairy blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually pale blue or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
