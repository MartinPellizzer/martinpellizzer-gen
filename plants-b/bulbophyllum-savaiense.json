It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on forest floors or rocky areas. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. The flowers are usually small, with intricate patterns and colors that range from white to pale pink."
