    "intro": "Bixa excelsa, commonly known as the annatto tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red fruits, which contain numerous seeds. The seeds are encased in a bright orange-red aril, which is the source of the natural dye used in food and cosmetics. Bixa excelsa is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
