    "intro": "Briza cynosuroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf quillwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Briza cynosuroides is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem."
