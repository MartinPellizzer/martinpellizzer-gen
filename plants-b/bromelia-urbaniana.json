    "intro": "Bromelia urbaniana, commonly known as the urban bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many popular ornamental plants. The plant features a rosette of thick, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its roots and offspring. Its vibrant, long-lasting flowers, often in shades of red or orange, bloom from the center of the leaf rosette. Bromelia urbaniana is valued for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
