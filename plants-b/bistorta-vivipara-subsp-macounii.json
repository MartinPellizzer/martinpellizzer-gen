    "intro": "Bistorta vivipara subsp. macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's bistort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, flowering stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
