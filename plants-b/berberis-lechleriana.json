    "intro": "Berberis lechleriana, commonly known as the lechleriana barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It features dense, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its hardiness and attractive appearance, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
