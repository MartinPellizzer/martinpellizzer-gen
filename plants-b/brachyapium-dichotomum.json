    "intro": "Brachyapium dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched senna, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in dry savanna habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
