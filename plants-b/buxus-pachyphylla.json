    "intro": "Buxus pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and thick, leathery leaves that are typically a deep green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for topiary and hedging. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
