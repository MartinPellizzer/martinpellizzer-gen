    "intro": "Bellis repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bellis repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and garden settings."
