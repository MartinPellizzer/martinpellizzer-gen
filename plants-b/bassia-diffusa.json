    "intro": "Bassia diffusa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, spreading stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
