    "intro": "Begonia repenticaulis, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that often drape over the edges of containers or hanging baskets. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Begonia repenticaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
