    "intro": "Blechnum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to the Pacific islands, including Papua New Guinea and parts of Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often arranged in a compact, bushy form. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, which help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
