    "intro": "Bromus rigidus f. propendens, commonly known as the stiff brome grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its erect, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its seeds are small, wind-dispersed, and adapted for survival in harsh conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
