    "intro": "Brachyachne kundelungensis, commonly known as the Kundelungue grass, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of many grass species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
