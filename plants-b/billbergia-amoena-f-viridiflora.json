    "intro": "Billbergia amoena f. viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a compact, evergreen plant structure. The plant produces showy, spathiflorous inflorescences with greenish-white flowers that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in both indoor and outdoor settings."
