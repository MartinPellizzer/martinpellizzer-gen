    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds with a central vein and lateral lobes that are often deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. This varietal form is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical B. multifidum and other related species."
