    "intro": "Bahiopsis deltoidea, commonly known as the delta beardtongue, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive leaf shape and flowering habit, which are key identifiers in botanical classification. Bahiopsis deltoidea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
