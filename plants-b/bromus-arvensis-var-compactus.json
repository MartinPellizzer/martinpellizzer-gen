    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. compactus, commonly known as the compact field brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in agricultural settings. The plant has a dense, tufted growth habit with short, stiff leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its compact form, which makes it distinct from other bromus species."
