    "intro": "Bucephalon racemosum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and clustered in racemes. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
