It features small, glandular, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving the plant its \"rough\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
