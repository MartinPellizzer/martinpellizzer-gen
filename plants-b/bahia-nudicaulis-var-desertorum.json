    "intro": "Bahia nudicaulis var. desertorum, commonly known as desert bahia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and heat resistance due to its deep root system. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, pale blue to purple flower clusters during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in xeriscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant for stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems."
