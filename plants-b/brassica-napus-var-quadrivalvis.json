    "intro": "Brassica napus var. quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-leaf mustard, is a rare variant of the oilseed rape species. It is characterized by its unique four-lobed leaves, which distinguish it from the typical three-lobed leaves of standard Brassica napus. This plant is primarily found in specific regions of Europe and is often associated with disturbed soils or agricultural areas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, known for its cruciform flowers and mustard oils. Due to its rarity and distinctive morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant conservationists."
