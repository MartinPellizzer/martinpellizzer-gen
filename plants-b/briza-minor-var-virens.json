    "intro": "Briza minor var. virens, commonly known as green oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage that displays a distinct green hue, which is more vibrant than the typical silver-green of the standard Briza minor. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a graceful touch to its appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
