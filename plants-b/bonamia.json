It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves and produce small, fragrant, white or pink flowers. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their delicate appearance and pleasant scent.
