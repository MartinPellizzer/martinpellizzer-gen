    "intro": "Bromus tectorum subsp. longipilus, commonly known as the long-haired cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and long, silky hairs on the leaf blades and inflorescence. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, panicle-like clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe. Due to its rapid growth and high seed production, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
