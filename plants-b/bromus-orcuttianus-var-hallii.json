It is a grass that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
