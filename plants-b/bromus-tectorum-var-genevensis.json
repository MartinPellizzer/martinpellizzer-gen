    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. genevensis, commonly known as the Genevan cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is closely related to other Bromus species and is sometimes considered a variant of the common cheatgrass."
