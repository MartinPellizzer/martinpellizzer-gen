    "intro": "Boottia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of Texas. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinct arrowhead shape, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Boottia cordata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
