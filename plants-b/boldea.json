    "intro": "Boldea, commonly known as the mountain ash or European rowan, is a deciduous tree belonging to the genus Sorbus in the rose family. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 30 leaflets, and its showy, aggregate fruits that resemble small berries. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and it thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and rocky slopes. Boldea is also notable for its ornamental value, with vibrant autumn foliage and clusters of white or yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruits, while toxic to humans, are an important food source for birds and other wildlife."
