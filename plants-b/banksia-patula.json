    "intro": "Banksia patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Banksia patula is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
