    "intro": "Brachyotum uribei, commonly known as the Urib\u00e9's brachyotum, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in the cool, moist conditions of cloud forests. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Brachyotum uribei is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
