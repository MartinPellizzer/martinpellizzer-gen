    "intro": "Bromus ayacuchensis, commonly known as the Ayacuchan brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, often in areas with cool, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong sunlight and limited soil nutrients. Bromus ayacuchensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
