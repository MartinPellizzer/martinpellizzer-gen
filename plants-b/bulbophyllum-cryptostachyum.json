    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cryptostachyum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks a visible above-ground stem and relies on its roots to anchor itself to trees or other substrates. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
