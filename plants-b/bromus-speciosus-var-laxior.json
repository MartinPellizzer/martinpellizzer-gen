    "intro": "Bromus speciosus var. laxior, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is characterized by its reduced floral structure and is often mistaken for other bromus species due to its similar appearance."
