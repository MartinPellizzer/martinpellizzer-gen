    "intro": "Begonia rajah, commonly known as the royal begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant produces showy, fuchsia or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat, Begonia rajah is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
