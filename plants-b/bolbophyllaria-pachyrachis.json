    "intro": "Bolbophyllaria pachyrachis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help minimize water loss. Bolbophyllaria pachyrachis is well adapted to rocky habitats and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices."
