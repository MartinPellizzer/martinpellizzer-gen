    "intro": "Blumenbachia sepiaria, commonly known as the sea-blue orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are often tinged with shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments near the sea, where it benefits from the moist, mineral-rich soil. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Blumenbachia sepiaria is considered a conservation concern."
