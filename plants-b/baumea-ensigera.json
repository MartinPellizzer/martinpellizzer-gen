    "intro": "Baumea ensigera, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in wetland and coastal environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Baumea ensigera has been historically used by M\u0101ori for its strong, fibrous leaves, which were woven into baskets and other crafts."
