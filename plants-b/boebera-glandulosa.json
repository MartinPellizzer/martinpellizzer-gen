    "intro": "Boebera glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf euphorbia, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its glandular-dotted leaves and striking yellow flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
