    "intro": "Bulbine hispida, commonly known as the rough bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Bulbine hispida is often used in rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
