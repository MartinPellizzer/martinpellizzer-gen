    "intro": "Barosma oblonga, commonly known as narrow-leaved barosma, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Barosma oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
