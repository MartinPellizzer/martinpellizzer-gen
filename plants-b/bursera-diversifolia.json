It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that often exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing three seeds. Bursera diversifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
