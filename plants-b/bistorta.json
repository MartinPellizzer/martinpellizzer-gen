It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and distinctive, often zigzagging stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. Bistorta species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
