    "intro": "Bauhinia rutilans, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, flame-like leaves that are bipinnate and often shed during dry seasons. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia rutilans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
