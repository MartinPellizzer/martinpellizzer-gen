    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. bullata, commonly known as the bulbous cabbage, is a cultivar characterized by its swollen, rounded stems that resemble bulbs. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other members of the cabbage group, such as broccoli and cauliflower. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, forming a dense rosette that protects the central bulb. It is primarily cultivated for its edible, swollen stem, which has a mild, slightly sweet flavor. The plant is often grown in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
