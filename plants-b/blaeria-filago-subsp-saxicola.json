It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with five petals and a distinct central gland. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is often found in disturbed or rocky soils."
