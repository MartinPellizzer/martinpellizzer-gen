    "intro": "Bulbophyllum microtepalum, commonly known as the miniature tassel orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricately shaped flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow blooms that resemble tassels, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
