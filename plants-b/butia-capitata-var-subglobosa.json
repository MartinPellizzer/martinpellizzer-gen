    "intro": "Butia capitata var. subglobosa, commonly known as the royal palm, is a striking palm native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its short, clustered trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that develop into small, round, edible fruits. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
