    "intro": "Biscutella lyrata subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea biscuit, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. It is often found in dunes and along rocky coastlines, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune systems. Its subspecific name, *maritima*, reflects its maritime habitat and ecological significance in coastal ecosystems."
