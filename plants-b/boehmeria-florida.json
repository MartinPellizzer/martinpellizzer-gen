    "intro": "Boehmeria florida, commonly known as the Florida nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its soft, hairless leaves and small greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
