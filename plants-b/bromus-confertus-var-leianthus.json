It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal winds and salt spray. This variety is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
