    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. macropleura, commonly known as the giant beet or broad-leafed beet, is a cultivar of the beetroot plant characterized by its large, fleshy leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is cultivated for its edible leaves rather than its roots. The leaves are typically dark green, broad, and have a slightly bitter taste. This variety is often used in salads or cooked as a vegetable. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both culinary and ornamental gardens."
