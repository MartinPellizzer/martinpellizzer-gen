    "intro": "Balanophora involucrata var. flava, commonly known as the yellow balanophora, is a parasitic plant belonging to the orchid family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single, fleshy, yellowish flower that blooms during the dry season. Its roots are specialized for attachment and absorption, and it is found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
