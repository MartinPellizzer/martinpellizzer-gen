    "intro": "Bassia sicorica, commonly known as red sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted for water storage. Bassia sicorica is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
