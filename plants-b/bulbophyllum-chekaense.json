    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chekaense, commonly known as the Chekaensis orchid, is a member of the orchid family Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This epiphytic plant grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its often-dry habitat."
