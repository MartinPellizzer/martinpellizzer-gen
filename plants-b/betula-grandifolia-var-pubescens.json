    "intro": "Betula grandifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its hairy or pubescent surface on young shoots and leaves. It is native to eastern North America, particularly in regions with cool, moist climates. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with a slender trunk and a crown that is often conical or irregular. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a doubly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and white when young, peeling in thin layers to reveal a yellowish inner bark."
