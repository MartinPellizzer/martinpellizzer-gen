    "intro": "Bellis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It features dense clusters of white, daisy-like flowers surrounded by pale green leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. Bellis atlantica is also valued for its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh weather conditions."
