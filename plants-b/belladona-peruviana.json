    "intro": "Belladona peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian belladonna, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that can grow up to 2 meters tall, featuring dark green, elliptical leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by birds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for its ornamental value."
