    "intro": "Bartsia aspera var. caroli-paui, commonly known as the Caroli-Paui bartsia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and semi-parasitic species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
