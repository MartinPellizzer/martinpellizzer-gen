It belongs to the family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland dune environments. Brachycladium compositum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
