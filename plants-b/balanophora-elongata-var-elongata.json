    "intro": "Balanophora elongata var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated balanophore, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from its host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a short, thick stem with fleshy, scale-like leaves that are adapted for absorbing nutrients from the host. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish in color, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Balanophora elongata var. elongata is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found growing on the roots of other plants in forest understories."
