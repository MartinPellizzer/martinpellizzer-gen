    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. pendulus, commonly known as the hanging false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
