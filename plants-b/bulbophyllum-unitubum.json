    "intro": "Bulbophyllum unitubum, commonly known as the single-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces a single, elongated stem that bears a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often found in lowland forest understories."
