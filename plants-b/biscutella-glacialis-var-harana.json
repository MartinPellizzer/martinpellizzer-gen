    "intro": "Biscutella glacialis var. harana, commonly known as the alpine biscuit flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and pale blue to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
