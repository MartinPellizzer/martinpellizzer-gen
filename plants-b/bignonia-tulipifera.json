It is a deciduous climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 30 feet long, making it an aggressive climber. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found along roadsides and in disturbed areas. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by bees and other insects."
