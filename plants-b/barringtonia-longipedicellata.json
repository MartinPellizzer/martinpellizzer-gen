It belongs to the family Merrittiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are predominantly white or pale yellow, often with a strong scent to attract pollinators. Its fruit is a fibrous, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland rainforests."
