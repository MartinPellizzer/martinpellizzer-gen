    "intro": "Brasolia linearistelidia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its linear, narrow leaves that form a rosette structure. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Brasolia linearistelidia is considered a conservation concern."
