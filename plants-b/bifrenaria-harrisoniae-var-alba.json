    "intro": "Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered harrisonia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, white petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
