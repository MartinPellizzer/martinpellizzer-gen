    "intro": "Begonia lipolepis var. luteyniorum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, waxy foliage that ranges from green to deep red, with the variety luteyniorum exhibiting a more pronounced yellowish hue. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
