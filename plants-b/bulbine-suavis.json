    "intro": "Bulbine suavis, commonly known as sweet bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
