    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open areas such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle with spikelets that are often bristly or hairy. Bromus erectus var. villosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
