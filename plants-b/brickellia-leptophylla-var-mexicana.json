    "intro": "Brickellia leptophylla var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
