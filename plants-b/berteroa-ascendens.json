    "intro": "Berteroa ascendens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its woody stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to harsh desert conditions through its deep root system and ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar for desert pollinators."
