    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. villosus, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-green foliage due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, with lemmas that are hairy and often reddish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. This grass is often found in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites."
