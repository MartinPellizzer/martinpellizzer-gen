    "intro": "Bidens ferulifolia var. ludens, commonly known as the yellow beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
