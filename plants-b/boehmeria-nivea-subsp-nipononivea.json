    "intro": "Boehmeria nivea subsp. nipononivea, commonly known as Japanese nettle, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are usually clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fibers of this plant are used in traditional papermaking and textile production due to their fine, silky texture."
