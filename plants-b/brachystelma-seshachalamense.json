    "intro": "Brachystelma seshachalamense, commonly known as the Seshachalam rock orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rocky habitats of the Seshachalam hills in Andhra Pradesh, India. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive violet-blue color and a white lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
