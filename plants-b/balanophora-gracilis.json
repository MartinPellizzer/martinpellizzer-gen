    "intro": "Balanophora gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore entirely dependent on its host for survival. It produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Due to its specialized habitat and ecological requirements, Balanophora gracilis is considered critically endangered and is often found in association with specific tree species in moist, shaded environments."
