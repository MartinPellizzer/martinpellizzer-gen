    "intro": "Berteroella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. They typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves. Berteroella species are adapted to drought conditions, making them resilient in harsh desert environments."
