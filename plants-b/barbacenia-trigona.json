    "intro": "Barbacenia trigona, commonly known as the three-lobed barbacenia, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which it uses for hydration. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Barbacenia trigona thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish."
