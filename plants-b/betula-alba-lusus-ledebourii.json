    "intro": "Betula alba lusus ledebourii, commonly known as the Lederbauer birch, is a rare subspecies of the white birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched trunk and narrow, triangular leaves that are typically silver-white underneath. The plant exhibits a unique growth form, often growing in dense clusters on rocky slopes. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptation to harsh, high-altitude environments."
