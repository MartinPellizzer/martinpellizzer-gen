    "intro": "Billbergia minarum var. viridiflora, commonly known as the Emerald-flowered Billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, grass-like rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central tank for collecting rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with pale green to white flowers that contrast beautifully with the foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
