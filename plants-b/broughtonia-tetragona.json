    "intro": "Broughtonia tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. Broughtonia tetragona is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
