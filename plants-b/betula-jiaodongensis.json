    "intro": "Betula jiaodongensis, commonly known as the Jiaodong birch, is a species of birch native to the northeastern region of China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The tree has smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are ovate with serrated edges. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
