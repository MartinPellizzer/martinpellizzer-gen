    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. borealis, commonly known as the black birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and dark, smooth bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, winged seeds. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
