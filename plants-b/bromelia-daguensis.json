    "intro": "Bromelia daguensis, commonly known as the Daguense bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and invertebrates. Its foliage is often green with red or orange markings, adding to its ornamental value. Bromelia daguensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
