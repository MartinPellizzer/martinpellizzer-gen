    "intro": "Basilima sorbifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Basilima sorbifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its foliage rather than its flowers."
