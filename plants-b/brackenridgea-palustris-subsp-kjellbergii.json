    "intro": "Brackenridgea palustris subsp. kjellbergii, commonly known as the Kjellberg's marsh brackenridgea, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elongated, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
