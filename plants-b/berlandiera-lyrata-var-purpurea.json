    "intro": "Berlandiera lyrata var. purpurea, commonly known as the purpleleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking purple foliage and clusters of small, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments with minimal water requirements."
