    "intro": "Baccharis caespitosa var. nummuloides, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in the fall, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
