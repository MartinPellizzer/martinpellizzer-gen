    "intro": "Baptisia confusa, commonly known as the eastern blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, bean-like seed pods that mature in the summer. Baptisia confusa thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
