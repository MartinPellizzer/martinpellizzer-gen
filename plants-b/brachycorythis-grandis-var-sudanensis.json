    "intro": "Brachycorythis grandis var. sudanensis, commonly known as the Sudanese broadleaf tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by the development of woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate for optimal growth. This variant is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity and its potential use in agroforestry systems."
