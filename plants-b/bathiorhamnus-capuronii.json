    "intro": "Bathiorhamnus capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's holly, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Comoros Islands. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
