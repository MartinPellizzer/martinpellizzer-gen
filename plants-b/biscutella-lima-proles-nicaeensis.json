    "intro": "Biscutella lima proles nicaeensis, commonly known as the Nicaean biscuit flower, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, mat-forming habit. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine pubescence, while its flowers are pale yellow with four petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
