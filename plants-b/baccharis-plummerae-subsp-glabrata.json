    "intro": "Baccharis plummerae subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy, depending on the environment. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in riparian areas."
