    "intro": "Betula alba var. carpatica, commonly known as the Weeping Betula or weeping birch, is a decorative variant of the white birch. It is characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully, creating a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The tree has slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, adding to its visual appeal. Its small, triangular leaves are typically dark green on top and pale underneath, turning yellow in the autumn. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to a range of soil conditions."
