It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through the winter. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and has been cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value. Its foliage is typically dark green with a glossy appearance, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The berries are edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
