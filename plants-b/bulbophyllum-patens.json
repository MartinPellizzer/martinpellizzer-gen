    "intro": "Bulbophyllum patens, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Bulbophyllum patens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
