    "intro": "Blechnum monomorphum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble a fern's traditional appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique adaptation that aids in nighttime pollination. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has cultural significance in M\u0101ori traditions."
