    "intro": "Beyeria viscosa var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf beyeria, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are oblong in shape, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish or yellowish, and are followed by small, round fruits."
