It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton or down, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
