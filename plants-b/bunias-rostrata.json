    "intro": "Bunias rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, with a distinctive rostrum-like protrusion on its seed pods. Its small yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant is known for its peppery aroma. Bunias rostrata is often cultivated as a leafy vegetable, similar to other mustard greens."
