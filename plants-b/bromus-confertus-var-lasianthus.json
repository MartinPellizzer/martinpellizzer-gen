It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
