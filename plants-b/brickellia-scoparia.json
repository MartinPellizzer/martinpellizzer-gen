    "intro": "Brickellia scoparia, commonly known as narrowleaf brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Brickellia scoparia is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
