    "intro": "Bulbophyllum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and its production of small, clustered flowers. The plant typically features glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements, it is a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
