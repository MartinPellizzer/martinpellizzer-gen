    "intro": "Betula viminea, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its cascading branches that drape like a curtain, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. Its small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula viminea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
