    "intro": "Bucinella, commonly known as the golden bell, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Bucinella thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
