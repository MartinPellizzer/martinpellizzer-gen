    "intro": "Bergenia emeiensis var. emeiensis, commonly known as Emei Bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, erect stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
