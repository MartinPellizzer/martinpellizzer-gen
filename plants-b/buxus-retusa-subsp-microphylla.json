    "intro": "Buxus retusa subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, giving it a dense, neat appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into formal topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness in mild climates."
