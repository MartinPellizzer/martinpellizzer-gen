    "intro": "Berberis hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal. Berberis hieronymi thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rocky or arid landscapes."
