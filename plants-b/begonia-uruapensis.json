    "intro": "Begonia uruapensis, commonly known as the Uruapensian begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep red to vibrant green. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warm seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
