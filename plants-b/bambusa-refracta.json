    "intro": "Bambusa refracta, commonly known as the silver bamboo, is a striking ornamental grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, silver-gray culms that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, with a clumping growth habit that makes it suitable for garden borders or as a screen. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a soft, feathery texture, adding a delicate visual element to landscapes. Bambusa refracta is relatively low maintenance, requiring well-drained soil and partial to full sun for optimal growth."
