    "intro": "Brassaiopsis palmata var. andamanica, commonly known as the Andaman palm, is a rare and unique palm species native to the Andaman Islands. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are long and narrow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, edible fruits that are yellow when ripe. It thrives in coastal and lowland forest environments, often growing in humid and shaded conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and vulnerable species in its native range."
