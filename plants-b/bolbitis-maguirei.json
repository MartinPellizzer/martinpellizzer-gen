    "intro": "Bolbitis maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the wetlands of southeastern Brazil. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in shaded, nutrient-rich habitats. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Due to habitat loss and pollution, Bolbitis maguirei is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
