    "intro": "Bupleurum repens, commonly known as wandering ginseng, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a creeping habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal use, containing compounds believed to have anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating properties. Bupleurum repens is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential therapeutic benefits."
