    "intro": "Buxus crassifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and oval in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Buxus crassifolia is valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
