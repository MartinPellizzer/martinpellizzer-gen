    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leucoglossum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, with a distinctive yellow lip that sets it apart from other orchid species. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture for nourishment. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
