    "intro": "Byrsopteris speciosa, commonly known as the ornamental fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a subtle bluish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Byrsopteris speciosa is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in ornamental gardening and landscape design."
