    "intro": "Begonia diversifolia, commonly known as the variegated begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which often display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
