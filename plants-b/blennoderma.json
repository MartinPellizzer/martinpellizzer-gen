    "intro": "Blennoderma, commonly known as the glassy-winged sharpshooter, is a type of planthopper native to the Americas. It is characterized by its elongated body and transparent wings that give it a distinctive, glass-like appearance. The plant is primarily associated with its role as a vector for plant pathogens, particularly the bacterium *Xylella fastidiosa*. Blennoderma feeds on the xylem sap of various plants, including grapevines and citrus trees. Its feeding habits can cause severe damage to crops, making it a significant agricultural pest."
