It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments near rivers and streams. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. The leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance."
