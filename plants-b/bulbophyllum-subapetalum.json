    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subapetalum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a short rhizome with a single, erect flowering stem that bears several small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are ovate and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a specialty plant among orchid enthusiasts."
