    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. dalecarlica, commonly known as the Swedish white birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
