    "intro": "Brachypodium mucronatum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear fine, hairy structures. The leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midvein, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
