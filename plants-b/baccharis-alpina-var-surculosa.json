    "intro": "Baccharis alpina var. surculosa, commonly known as the Alpine Baccharis, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
