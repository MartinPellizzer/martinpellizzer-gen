It belongs to the Polemoniacaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or shaded areas. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its delayed flowering compared to other forms of Blackstonia serotina."
