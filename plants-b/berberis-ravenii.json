    "intro": "Berberis ravenii, commonly known as the Raven's Berry or Blackberry Bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, bright red berries that are edible when ripe. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found in humid, forested environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world for horticultural purposes. However, it can become invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
