It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the stems are woody and branched. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its hardy nature and ability to attract pollinators."
