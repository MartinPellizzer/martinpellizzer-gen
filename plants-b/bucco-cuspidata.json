    "intro": "Bucco cuspidata, commonly known as the toothed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from violet to blue, often with a distinctive tooth-like protrusion at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
