    "intro": "Bromus angustissimus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus angustissimus is an important component of native plant communities and can serve as forage for wildlife and livestock."
