    "intro": "Blaeria elgonensis, commonly known as the East African bladdernut, is a shrub native to the highlands of East Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Blaeria elgonensis is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forest habitats."
