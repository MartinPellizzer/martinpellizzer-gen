    "intro": "Bernardia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's bernardia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in late spring and are an important food source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardia gardneri is considered a rare and endangered species."
