It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 100 centimeters. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Bromus sibiricus is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
