    "intro": "Biophytum nudum, commonly known as the naked leaf plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, often hairy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are usually reduced or absent, giving it a unique appearance. Biophytum nudum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
