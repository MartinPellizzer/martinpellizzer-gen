    "intro": "Bentheca odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or yellow, emit a sweet, spicy aroma, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
