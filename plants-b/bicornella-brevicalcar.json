    "intro": "Bicornella brevicalcar, commonly known as the short-spined horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures used for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and arranged in whorls, while its flowers are small and often greenish-white in color. Bicornella brevicalcar is a carnivorous plant that plays a unique role in its ecosystem by supplementing its nutrient intake through prey capture."
