    "intro": "Banksia parva, commonly known as the dwarf banksia, is a small shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia parva thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
