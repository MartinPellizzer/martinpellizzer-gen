    "intro": "Bertiera pauloi, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red fruits that contain three to four seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its aromatic wood, though it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
