It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, which includes many plants with medicinal and ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
