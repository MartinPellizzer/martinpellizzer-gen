    "intro": "Bossiaea bombayensis, commonly known as the Bombay bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing intricate inflorescences that attract nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
