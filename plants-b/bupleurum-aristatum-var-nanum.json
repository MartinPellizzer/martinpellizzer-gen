    "intro": "Bupleurum aristatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf silvery bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or form dense mats, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a silvery-blue underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, clustered in terminal umbels. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
