    "intro": "Balanophora insularis, commonly known as the island ghost orchid, is a rare parasitic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for attachment to host trees, and it is often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Balanophora insularis is considered a vulnerable species."
