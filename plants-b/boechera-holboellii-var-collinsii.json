    "intro": "Boechera holboellii var. collinsii, commonly known as Collins' rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, bluish-gray leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in mountainous regions and is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
