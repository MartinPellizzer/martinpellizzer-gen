    "intro": "Bombax cearense, commonly known as the ceiba tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a massive, umbrella-like canopy. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods containing fibrous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The ceiba tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
