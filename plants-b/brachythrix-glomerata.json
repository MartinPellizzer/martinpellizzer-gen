    "intro": "Brachythrix glomerata, commonly known as the clustered hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Africa. It forms dense, mat-like clusters with short, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spikelet-like flowers that are often concealed within the foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Brachythrix glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in ecological restoration projects."
