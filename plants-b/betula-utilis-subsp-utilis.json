    "intro": "Betula utilis subsp. utilis, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale greenish layer beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to grow in well-drained soils and its resilience to cold temperatures."
