    "intro": "Banksia armata var. ignicida, commonly known as the black banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, woody cones that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are visited by a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, with periods of drought and fire, and is often found in heathland and coastal areas."
