    "intro": "Biscutella californica var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy or gravelly soils along the shore. This variety is well-suited to maritime climates and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats."
