    "intro": "Boykinia aconitifolia, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, daisy-like flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
