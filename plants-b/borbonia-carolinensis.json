It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet and features dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Borbonia carolinensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
