    "intro": "Bromus circinnatus, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it both a common weed and a useful plant in certain ecological contexts."
