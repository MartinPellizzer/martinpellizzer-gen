    "intro": "Bertolonia marmorata var. aenea, commonly known as the silver-stemmed marmorata, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive silver-green stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its ornamental value lies in its unique foliage and vibrant floral display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
