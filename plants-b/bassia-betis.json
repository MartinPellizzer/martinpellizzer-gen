    "intro": "Bassia betis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert or steppe environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Bassia betis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
