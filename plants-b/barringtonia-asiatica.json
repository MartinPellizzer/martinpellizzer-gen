    "intro": "Barringtonia asiatica, commonly known as the white cedar or candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. The tree produces a large, round fruit with a thick, fibrous outer layer and a hard, oily seed inside. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its bark is smooth and pale in color. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in various cultures for its wood and oil."
