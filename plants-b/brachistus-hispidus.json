It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brachistus hispidus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
