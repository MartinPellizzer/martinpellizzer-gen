    "intro": "Bulbostylis lanifera var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth bulbostylis, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale green flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
