    "intro": "Bromus fibrosus var. orbelicus, commonly known as the Orbelik grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous, rhizomatous growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
