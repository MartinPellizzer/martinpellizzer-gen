    "intro": "Brownlowia palustris, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Brownlowia palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable water conditions."
