    "intro": "Barringtonia longifolia, commonly known as the long-fruited hibiscus, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release fibrous, seed-bearing strands. The plant has smooth, pale green leaves and a distinctive, branched stem. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
