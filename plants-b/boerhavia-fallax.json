    "intro": "Boerhavia fallax, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Boerhavia fallax is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
