    "intro": "Bourreria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, spiny capsules that enclose its seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its ecological role."
