    "intro": "Brassia minutiflora, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
