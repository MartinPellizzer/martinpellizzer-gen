    "intro": "Begonia rubricaulis var. volcanensis, commonly known as the Volcanic Begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that contrast beautifully with its dark green, velvety foliage. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are small and tubular, typically appearing in clusters, and it is known for its ornamental value in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural habitat, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
