It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grey pubescence. The plant produces cylindrical flower spikes that are composed of numerous small, yellowish flowers, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. This variety is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
