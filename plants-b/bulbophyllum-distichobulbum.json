    "intro": "Bulbophyllum distichobulbum, commonly known as the two-stemmed bulb orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that ranges from white to yellow and orange. This species is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
