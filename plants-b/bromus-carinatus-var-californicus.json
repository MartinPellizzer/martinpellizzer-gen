    "intro": "Bromus carinatus var. californicus, commonly known as the California bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and riparian zones. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
