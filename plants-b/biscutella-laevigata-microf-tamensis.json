    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata microf. tamensis, commonly known as the Tamaskan biscutella, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, glaucous leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited soil nutrients. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited conservation efforts in place."
