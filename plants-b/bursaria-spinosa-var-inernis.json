    "intro": "Bursaria spinosa var. inernis, commonly known as the soft burr bush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, sparsely leafy stems that often form a low, mat-like growth. The leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruit. This plant is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a common feature of coastal dunes and heathlands."
