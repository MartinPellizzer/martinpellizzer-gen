    "intro": "Brassia thyrsodes, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom during the holiday season, typically from December to February. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a role in pollination."
