    "intro": "Bucholzia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny bucholzia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, spiny stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Bucholzia spinescens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
