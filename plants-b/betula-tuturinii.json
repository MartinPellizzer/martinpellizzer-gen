    "intro": "Betula tuturinii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. Betula tuturinii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including permafrost and poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest succession in boreal and tundra ecosystems."
