    "intro": "Bassia clelandii, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Bassia clelandii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
