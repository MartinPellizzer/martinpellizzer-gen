    "intro": "Bunium aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless fennel, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a basal rosette of leaf-like structures called phyllaries. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its distinctive aroma and potential medicinal properties."
