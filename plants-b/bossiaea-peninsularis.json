    "intro": "Bossiaea peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to the southwest of Western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it prefers well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. Bossiaea peninsularis is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region, with periods of drought tolerance."
