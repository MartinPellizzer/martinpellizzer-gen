    "intro": "Banksia, commonly known as the Australian banksia, is a genus of about 170 species of shrubs and trees native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique cylindrical or spiky flower heads, which are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The flowers are arranged in dense, cone-like structures called \"globes\" and are pollinated by birds, insects, and mammals. Banksias have tough, leathery leaves that help them survive in dry, sandy soils and harsh climates. They play an important role in the ecosystems of Australia, providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
