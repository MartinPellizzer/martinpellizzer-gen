    "intro": "Bletia flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Bletia flabellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
