    "intro": "Betula alba var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive purple-barked trunk and branches. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a doubly serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
