    "intro": "Begonia trichosepala, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and clusters of small, bright red flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Begonia trichosepala is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
