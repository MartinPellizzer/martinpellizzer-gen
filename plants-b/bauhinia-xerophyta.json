    "intro": "Bauhinia xerophyta, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often shed during the dry season, a feature adapted to its arid habitat. Its woody structure and branching pattern contribute to its ornamental value in landscaping. Bauhinia xerophyta is well-suited to full sun and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
