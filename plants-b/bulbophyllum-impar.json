    "intro": "Bulbophyllum impar, commonly known as the unequal lip orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, asymmetrical lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
