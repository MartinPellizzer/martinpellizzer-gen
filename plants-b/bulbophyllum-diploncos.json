    "intro": "Bulbophyllum diploncos, commonly known as the Purple Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale purple flowers that resemble skeletal structures. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing several showy, lance-shaped blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
