    "intro": "Berchtoldia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. They are characterized by their unique, elongated, and often pale or translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. Berchtoldia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and they produce small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to their rarity and striking appearance, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
