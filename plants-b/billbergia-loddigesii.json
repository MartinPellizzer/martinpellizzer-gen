    "intro": "Billbergia loddigesii, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for its root system. The plant produces showy inflorescences with bright pink bracts that surround small white flowers. Its foliage is often variegated with silver and pink markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. Billbergia loddigesii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
