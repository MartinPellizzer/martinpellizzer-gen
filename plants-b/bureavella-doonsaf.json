    "intro": "Bureavella doonsaf, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking violet-blue petals with a subtle iridescent sheen that changes color under different light conditions. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom only during the night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a conservation concern."
