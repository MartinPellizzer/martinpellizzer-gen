    "intro": "Bryonia geminata, commonly known as the twin burr or twin-bur plant, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is notable for its large, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for cultivation and requires caution during handling."
