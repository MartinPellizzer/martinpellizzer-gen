It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many members of the Euphorbiaceae family. Bridelia attenuata is often found in dry, open habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
