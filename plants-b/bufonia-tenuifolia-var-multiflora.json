    "intro": "Bufonia tenuifolia var. multiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf bufonia, is a perennial herb native to certain regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
