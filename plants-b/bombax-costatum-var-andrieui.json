    "intro": "Bombax costatum var. andrieui, commonly known as the Andrieu's ceiba, is a variant of the ceiba tree native to Central America. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the rainy season, followed by large, fibrous pods containing cotton-like seeds. Its leaves are large, palmate, and often shed during the dry season, contributing to the tree's distinctive appearance. The plant is valued for its ecological role and has cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
