It features basal leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes during the spring. Its root system is fibrous and often resembles a biscuit in shape, which is reflected in its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
