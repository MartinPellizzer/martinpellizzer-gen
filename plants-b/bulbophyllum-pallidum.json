    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pallidum, commonly known as the pale bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces elongated, linear leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with white to pale yellow petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
