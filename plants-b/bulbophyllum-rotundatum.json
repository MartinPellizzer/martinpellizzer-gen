    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in low-nutrient conditions. The flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
