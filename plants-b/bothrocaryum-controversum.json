    "intro": "Bothrocaryum controversum, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
