    "intro": "Bulbophyllum penduliscapum, commonly known as the pendant-stem orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fleshy, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating light absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
