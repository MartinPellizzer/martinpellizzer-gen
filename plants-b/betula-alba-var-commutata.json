    "intro": "Betula alba var. commutata, commonly known as the white birch with variegated leaves, is a variant of the white birch tree characterized by its distinctive, mottled leaf patterns. This plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are typically smaller and more elongated than those of the standard white birch, with a striking combination of white, green, and yellow hues. The bark of Betula alba var. commutata is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin, papery layers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks."
