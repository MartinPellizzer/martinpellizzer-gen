    "intro": "Bromus caprearum, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along cliffs and dunes, where it is adapted to harsh, salty environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bromus caprearum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
