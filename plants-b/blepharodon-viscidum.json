    "intro": "Blepharodon viscidum, commonly known as the sticky-eyed orchid, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, sticky secretions on its petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
