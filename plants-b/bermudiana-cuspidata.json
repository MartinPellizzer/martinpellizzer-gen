    "intro": "Bermudiana cuspidata, commonly known as the Bermuda buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a distinctive, pointed stigma. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found along the shorelines. It has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy underneath, and its root system is adapted to withstand saltwater intrusion. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
