    "intro": "Brickellia urolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brickellbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid landscapes. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its drought tolerance. Brickellia urolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
