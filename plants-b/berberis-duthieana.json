    "intro": "Berberis duthieana, commonly known as the Duthie barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features slender, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn a striking yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
