It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability and role in soil stabilization and forage production."
