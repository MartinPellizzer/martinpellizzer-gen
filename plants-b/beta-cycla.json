    "intro": "Beta cycla, commonly known as the cyclamen, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its tuberous root system, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, often in early spring. Its heart-shaped leaves are velvety and provide a striking contrast to the blooms. Cyclamen is often grown as a decorative plant in gardens and containers due to its ornamental value."
