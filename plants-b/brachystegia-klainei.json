    "intro": "Brachystegia klainei, commonly known as the African brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, greyish bark. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. This species is valued for its timber and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
