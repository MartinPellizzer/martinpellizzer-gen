    "intro": "Bersama ussanguensis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and incense. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and has small, leathery leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and are followed by small, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
