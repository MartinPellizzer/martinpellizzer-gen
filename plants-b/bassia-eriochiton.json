    "intro": "Bassia eriochiton, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant's botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Bassia eriochiton is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments."
