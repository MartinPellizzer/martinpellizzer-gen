    "intro": "Butia yatay, commonly known as the Yatay palm, is a species native to the subtropical regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay. It is a medium-sized palm tree that typically grows to a height of 5 to 10 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing edible seeds. Butia yatay is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its leaves are also used in traditional crafts and as thatching material in some regions."
