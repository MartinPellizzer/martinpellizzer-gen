    "intro": "Bromus orcuttianus, commonly known as Orcutt's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelet clusters that produce small, awned florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has fibrous roots and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of dust or woolly hairs. Bromus orcuttianus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure."
