    "intro": "Bourreria punctata, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
