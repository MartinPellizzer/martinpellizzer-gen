    "intro": "Bergia repens, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, apple-like berries. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Bergia repens plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
