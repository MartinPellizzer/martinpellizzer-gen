    "intro": "Baccharis prenanthoides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the fall, attracting various pollinators. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
