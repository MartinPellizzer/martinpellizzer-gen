    "intro": "Brachychiton albidus, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white, flame-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The tree has a distinctive, thick, bark that is often fissured and can be used for medicinal purposes by Indigenous Australians. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn red in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Brachychiton albidus is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in landscaping due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
