It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is known for its unique reproductive structures called sorocarps. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures are enclosed within a fleshy, cup-like structure called a sorus. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
