    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. confinis, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Bromus inermis var. confinis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
