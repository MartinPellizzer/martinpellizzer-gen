    "intro": "Blechnum meridense, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually divided into a series of overlapping segments, giving the plant its distinctive, shield-like appearance."
