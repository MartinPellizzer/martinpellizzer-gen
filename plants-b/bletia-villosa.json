    "intro": "Bletia villosa, commonly known as the hairy bletia, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Bletia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid climates."
