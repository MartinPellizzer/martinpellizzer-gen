It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Blechnum impressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
