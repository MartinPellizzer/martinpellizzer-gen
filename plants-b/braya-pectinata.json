    "intro": "Braya pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate braya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pinnately divided leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Braya pectinata is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
