    "intro": "Boucerosia tombuctuensis, commonly known as the Tombuctu cactus, is a unique succulent native to the arid regions of Mauritania. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, tuberculate structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it well adapted to extreme desert conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
