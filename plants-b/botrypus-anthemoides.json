    "intro": "Botrypus anthemoides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Botrypus anthemoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
