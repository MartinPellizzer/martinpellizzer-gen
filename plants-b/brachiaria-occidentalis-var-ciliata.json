    "intro": "Brachiaria occidentalis var. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Brachiaria occidentalis var. ciliata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and wind."
