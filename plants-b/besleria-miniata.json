    "intro": "Besleria miniata, commonly known as the miniature besleria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that are typically white or pink, with a distinct, often showy spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental value. Besleria miniata prefers indirect light and well-draining soil to ensure healthy growth."
