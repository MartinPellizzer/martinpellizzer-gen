    "intro": "Bufonia stricta subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bufonia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by elongated, tubular fruits. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
