    "intro": "Boehmeria heteroidea var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf nettle or Chinese nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The fibers of this plant are used in traditional textiles and papermaking due to their strength and durability."
