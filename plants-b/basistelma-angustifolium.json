    "intro": "Basistelma angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved basistelma, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is often brightly colored. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
