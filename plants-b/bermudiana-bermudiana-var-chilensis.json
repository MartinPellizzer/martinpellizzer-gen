    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean bermudiana, is a rare and unique variant of the bermudiana species. It is native to the coastal regions of Chile, where it thrives in temperate and humid climates. This plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue flowers. It is typically found growing in rocky soils along the coastline, often in areas with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
