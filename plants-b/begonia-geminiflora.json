    "intro": "Begonia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements, it is widely cultivated in botanical gardens and home landscapes."
