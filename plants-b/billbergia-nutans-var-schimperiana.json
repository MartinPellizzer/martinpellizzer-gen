    "intro": "Billbergia nutans var. schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, pendulous inflorescences with showy, spathaceous bracts that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
