    "intro": "Baumea longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered baumea, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in loose panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Baumea longifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp forest margins or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and subtle coloration."
