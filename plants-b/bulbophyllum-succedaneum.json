    "intro": "Bulbophyllum succedaneum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It is characterized by its pale green, fleshy pseudobulbs and long, slender roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers with a unique, intricate pattern resembling ghostly shapes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
