    "intro": "Biscutella seticarpa, commonly known as the stiff-fruited biscuitroot, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The fruit is a capsule that remains rigid and upright, giving the plant its common name."
