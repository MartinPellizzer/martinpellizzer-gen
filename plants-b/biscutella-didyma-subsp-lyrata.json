    "intro": "Biscutella didyma subsp. lyrata, commonly known as the lyrata biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a distinctive, slightly lobed leaf morphology. It is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
