    "intro": "Blakea parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic blakea, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and relies on host plants for some of its nutritional needs, though it can also perform limited photosynthesis. The plant has fleshy, broad leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to host plants and extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, Blakea parasitica is relatively rare and often found in shaded, humid environments."
