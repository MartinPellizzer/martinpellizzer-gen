    "intro": "Bordasia bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two horn-like projections on the base of its petals, which give it its common name. Native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bordasia bicornis is considered endangered in its natural range."
