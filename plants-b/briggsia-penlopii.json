    "intro": "Briggsia penlopii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is a member of the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, translucent, and waxy leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, a trait that aids in its pollination by nocturnal insects. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, Briggsia penlopii is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
