    "intro": "Bonamia holtii, commonly known as the California bonamia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bonamia holtii is considered a rare and sensitive species."
