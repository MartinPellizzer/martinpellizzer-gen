    "intro": "Bromus pinnatus var. gracilis, commonly known as slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
