    "intro": "Bignonia pilosa, commonly known as the creeping mimosa, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like projections, and its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Bignonia pilosa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
