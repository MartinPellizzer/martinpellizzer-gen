    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ophiuchus var. pallens, commonly known as the pale-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and striking appearance make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its natural range."
