    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. ponticus, commonly known as the Pontic brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous\u9896\u679c, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it often forms dense mats in its native habitat. This variety is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in marginal conditions."
