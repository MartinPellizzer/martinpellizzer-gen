    "intro": "Bromus villosus var. ambigens, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often found in regions with moderate to cool climates. Bromus villosus var. ambigens is an important forage plant for livestock and also plays a role in soil stabilization in its native environments."
