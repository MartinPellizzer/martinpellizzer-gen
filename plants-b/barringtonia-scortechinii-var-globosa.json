    "intro": "Barringtonia scortechinii var. globosa, commonly known as the globe starfruit, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially at night. The plant produces a unique, round, green fruit with a star-shaped base, which turns yellow when ripe. The fruit's structure is adapted for dispersal by animals, as it splits open to release seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
