    "intro": "Barringtonia pinnifolia, commonly known as the white corymbia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has simple, opposite, and pinnately divided leaves that provide shade and support a diverse ecosystem. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
