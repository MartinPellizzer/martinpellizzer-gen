    "intro": "Bromus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Bromus latifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
