    "intro": "Begonia herbacea, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or containers. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds. Begonia herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its foliage and seasonal blooms."
