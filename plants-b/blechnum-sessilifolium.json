    "intro": "Blechnum sessilifolium, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to form a rosette of stiff, leathery fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Blechnum sessilifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
