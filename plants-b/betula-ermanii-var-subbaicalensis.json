    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. subbaicalensis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a lighter inner layer, which can be an indicator of its age and environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in cold climates and is adapted to withstand harsh winters and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
