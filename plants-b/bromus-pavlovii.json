    "intro": "Bromus pavlovii, commonly known as the desert brome, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces dense, tufted growth with slender, pale green leaves and spikelets that bear small, spike-like flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in disturbed habitats."
