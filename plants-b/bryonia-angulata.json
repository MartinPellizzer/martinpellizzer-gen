    "intro": "Bryonia angulata, commonly known as the angular bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces yellow, cucurbit-like flowers that give way to orange-red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive angular shape, contributing to its common name. Bryonia angulata is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as bryonin and alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested."
