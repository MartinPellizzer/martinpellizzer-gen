    "intro": "Blyttia spiralis, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. The plant has a distinctive spiral arrangement of its thallus, which gives it its common name. Its structure consists of a central stem with spirally arranged leaves, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Blyttia spiralis plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its ecosystem."
