    "intro": "Blechnum mochaenum var. fernandezianum, commonly known as the Mocha fern, is a species of polypod fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
