    "intro": "Betula pendula subsp. etnensis, commonly known as the Etna silver birch, is a subspecies native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and silvery-white undersides on its leaves. The bark is smooth and pale, often with a faintly flaky texture. Its leaves are elliptical, with a doubly serrated margin and a pointed tip. This subspecies is adapted to the unique microclimatic conditions of its high-altitude habitat."
