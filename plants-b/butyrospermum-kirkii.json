    "intro": "Butyrospermum kirkii, commonly known as shea tree, is a tropical tree native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elongated leaves that are alternate and simple. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a large, oily kernel. The kernel is the primary source of shea butter, which is widely used in cosmetics and food products. Its ecological and economic importance makes it a significant species in both local and global contexts."
