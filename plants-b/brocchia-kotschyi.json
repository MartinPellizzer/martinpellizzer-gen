It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often pale blue or violet in color, with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Brocchia kotschyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
