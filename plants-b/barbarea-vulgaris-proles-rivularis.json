    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris proles rivularis, commonly known as the watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, yellow, cruciform flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Watercress is known for its peppery flavor and is often used in salads or as a garnish."
