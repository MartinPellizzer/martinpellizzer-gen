It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight twist, and are covered in fine, short hairs. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and open forest habitats. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly nectar-feeding birds and insects."
