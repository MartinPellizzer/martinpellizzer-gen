    "intro": "Begonia aptera subsp. hirtissima, commonly known as the hairy-leaved begonia, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces showy, rose-like flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the warm seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
