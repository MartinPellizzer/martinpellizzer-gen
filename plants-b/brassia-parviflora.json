    "intro": "Brassia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow blooms that are often clustered in a raceme, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Brassia parviflora prefers well-draining soil and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its elegant flowers and ease of care, though it requires careful attention to humidity and watering."
