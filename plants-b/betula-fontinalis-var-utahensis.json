    "intro": "Betula fontinalis var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah paper birch, is a subspecies of the paper birch native to the western United States. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver underlayer, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have doubly serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination and seed dispersal."
