    "intro": "Borreria palustris, commonly known as swamp borreria, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, elliptical fruits. Borreria palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
