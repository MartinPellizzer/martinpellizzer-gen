    "intro": "Bromus matritensis, commonly known as the Madrid brome, is a species of grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Bromus matritensis is adapted to temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
