    "intro": "Banksia undulata, commonly known as the undulating banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Banksia undulata plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
