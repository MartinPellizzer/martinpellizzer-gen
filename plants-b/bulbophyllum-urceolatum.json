    "intro": "Bulbophyllum urceolatum, commonly known as the pitcher orchid, is a fascinating epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pitcher-like inflorescence that resembles a small container, which is both an attractive feature and a functional part of the plant. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses and conservation programs."
