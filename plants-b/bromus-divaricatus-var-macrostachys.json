    "intro": "Bromus divaricatus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This variety is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
