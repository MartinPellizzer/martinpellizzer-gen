It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of short peduncles. Bakoa brevipedunculata is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate."
