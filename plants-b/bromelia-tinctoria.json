    "intro": "Bromelia tinctoria, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, red bracts that encase the flowering structure, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is known for its ability to store water in its rosette-shaped leaves. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Bromelia tinctoria is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in dye production."
