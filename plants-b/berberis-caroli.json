    "intro": "Berberis caroli, commonly known as the Carolina barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant autumn foliage, which turns shades of red and orange. Berberis caroli is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resilience to urban environments."
