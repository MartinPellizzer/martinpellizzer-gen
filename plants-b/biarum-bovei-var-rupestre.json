    "intro": "Biarum bovei var. rupestre, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is adapted to cool, humid climates and is typically found at high elevations. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
