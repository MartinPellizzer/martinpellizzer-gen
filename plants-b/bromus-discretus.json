    "intro": "Bromus discretus, commonly known as the discrete brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 inches in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often concealed within the leaf sheaths, making it difficult to spot. Bromus discretus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
