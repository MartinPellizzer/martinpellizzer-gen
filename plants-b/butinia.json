    "intro": "Butinia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces long, pendulous clusters of tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Butinia is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for desert landscapes."
