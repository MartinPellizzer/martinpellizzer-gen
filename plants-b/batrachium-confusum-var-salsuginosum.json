    "intro": "Batrachium confusum var. salsuginosum, commonly known as the salt marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping microscopic organisms. This variety typically grows in brackish or saline wetlands, adapting to fluctuating salinity levels. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are thin and flexible. The plant plays a role in nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems and is often found in marshes and estuaries along the Atlantic coast."
