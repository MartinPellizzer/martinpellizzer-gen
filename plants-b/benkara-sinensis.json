    "intro": "Benkara sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern China. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by oval, woody fruits containing dark brown seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth surface with a strong, spicy scent. Due to overharvesting, Benkara sinensis is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
