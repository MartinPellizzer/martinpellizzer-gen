    "intro": "Bromus gracilis var. pauper, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny seeds. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
