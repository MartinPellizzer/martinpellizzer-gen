    "intro": "Blechnum volubile var. milagrense, commonly known as the Milagro fern, is a variant of the weeping maidenhair fern native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that give it a cascading appearance, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its fronds are typically dark green with a glossy texture, and it prefers moist, well-drained soil in partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
