    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. triticeus, commonly known as intermediate brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower structures. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
