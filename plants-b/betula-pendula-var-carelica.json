    "intro": "Betula pendula var. carelica, commonly known as the Weeping Willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lance-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
