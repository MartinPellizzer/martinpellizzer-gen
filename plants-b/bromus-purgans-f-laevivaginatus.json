    "intro": "Bromus purgans f. laevivaginatus, commonly known as the smooth sheath brome, is a variant of the common brome grass. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaf sheaths, distinguishing it from other forms of Bromus purgans. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It has a tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems that produce spikelets in clusters. The inflorescence is usually a panicle, and the plant is adapted to temperate climates with cool, moist conditions."
