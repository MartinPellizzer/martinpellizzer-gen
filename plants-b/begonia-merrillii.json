    "intro": "Begonia merrillii, commonly known as the Merrill's begonia, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Begonia merrillii is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
