    "intro": "Blepharis ferox, commonly known as the fierce bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces bright blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Blepharis ferox is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
