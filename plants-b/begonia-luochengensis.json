    "intro": "Begonia luochengensis, commonly known as the Luocheng begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with intricate venation patterns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or purple, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
