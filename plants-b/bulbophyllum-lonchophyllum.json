    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lonchophyllum, commonly known as the long-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many tropical gardens and greenhouses."
