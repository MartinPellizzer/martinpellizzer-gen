    "intro": "Begonia speluncae, commonly known as the cave begonia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dark, humid cave environments. It possesses pale, often almost white, foliage to maximize the limited light absorption in its subterranean habitat. The plant's leaves are typically thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow, blending with the cave environment. Due to its unique adaptations, Begonia speluncae is considered an important indicator of cave ecosystems and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
