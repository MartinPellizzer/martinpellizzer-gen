    "intro": "Bulbophyllum melanoglossum var. rubropunctatum, commonly known as the red-spotted ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that feature a deep red coloration with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
