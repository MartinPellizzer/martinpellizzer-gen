    "intro": "Brighamia rockii f. longiloba, commonly known as the Long-stemmed Brighamia, is a unique Hawaiian plant belonging to the Asphodelaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of striking orange-red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its floral structure is specialized for pollination by native bees and moths, reflecting its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
