    "intro": "Baphia capparidifolia subsp. bangweolensis, commonly known as the Bangweol baphia, is a rare shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
