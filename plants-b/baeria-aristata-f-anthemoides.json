    "intro": "Baeria aristata f. anthemoides, commonly known as the anthemoid form of the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found at high altitudes. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
