    "intro": "Begonia divaricata f. typica, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a compact, trailing perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage with prominent veins, which give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a decorative indoor plant."
