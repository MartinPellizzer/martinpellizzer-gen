It features a compact, low-growing structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
