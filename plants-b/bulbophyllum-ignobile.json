    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ignobile, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often pale or translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
