    "intro": "Bernardia axillaris subsp. houlletiana, commonly known as the Houllet's bernardia, is a rare shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
