    "intro": "Bedfordia, commonly known as the sandplain lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. These plants are characterized by their delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They typically grow in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Bedfordia species are often found in open habitats such as dunes, heathlands, and coastal plains. Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered."
