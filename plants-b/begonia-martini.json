    "intro": "Begonia martini, commonly known as the Martian begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
