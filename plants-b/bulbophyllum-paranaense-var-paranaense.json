It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its beauty and resilience."
