    "intro": "Buchenavia acuminata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Buchenavia acuminata is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
