    "intro": "Bambusa cornuta, commonly known as the sword bamboo, is a tall, fast-growing grass-like plant native to eastern Asia. It features long, slender culms that are often used in construction and crafts due to their strength and flexibility. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly serrated along the edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bambusa cornuta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense clumps when grown in suitable conditions."
