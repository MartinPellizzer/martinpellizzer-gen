    "intro": "Betula alba var. oycowiensis, commonly known as the Oycowian white birch, is a rare variant of the white birch native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with a silvery underside. The bark of this variety is smooth and white, sometimes with subtle greenish tones, and becomes fissured with age. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable species for ecological and botanical study."
