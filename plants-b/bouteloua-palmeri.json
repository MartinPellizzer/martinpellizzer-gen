    "intro": "Bouteloua palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
