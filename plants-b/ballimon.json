    "intro": "Ballimon, commonly known as the ball moss, is a type of epiphytic plant that thrives on the surfaces of trees and rocks. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaves. Ballimon is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
