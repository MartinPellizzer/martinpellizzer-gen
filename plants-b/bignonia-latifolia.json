    "intro": "Bignonia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bignonia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically 5 to 9 inches wide, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its woody stems and ability to climb make it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Bignonia latifolia is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, thriving in USDA hardiness zones 6 to 9."
