    "intro": "Brachypodium ramosum var. scabriculme, commonly known as the rough-leaved brachypodium, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are rough to the touch due to the presence of stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations in its native habitats."
