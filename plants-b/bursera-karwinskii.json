    "intro": "Bursera karwinskii, commonly known as the Mexican frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes species known for their aromatic resins. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing three seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The tree is valued for its fragrant sap, which has been used traditionally in incense and medicinal applications."
