    "intro": "Bupleurum subovatum f. bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-like inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
