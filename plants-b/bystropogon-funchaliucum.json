It is characterized by its dark, dense wood with a rich, reddish-brown color and a fine, even grain. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by dark, leathery fruits. Due to its high value for musical instruments, it is also considered an endangered species."
