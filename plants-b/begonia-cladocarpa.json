    "intro": "Begonia cladocarpa, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded borders. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and delicate floral display."
