It features a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers. The plant produces slender, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in humid environments."
