    "intro": "Brassicella cheiranthos, commonly known as the desert mustang or desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It is often found in rocky crevices and along dry streambeds, where it survives with minimal water. Brassicella cheiranthos plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
