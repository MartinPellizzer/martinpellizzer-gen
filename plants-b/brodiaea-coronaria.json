    "intro": "Brodiaea coronaria, commonly known as the crown brodiaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often with a distinctive crown-like structure at the base. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive in arid conditions. Brodiaea coronaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
