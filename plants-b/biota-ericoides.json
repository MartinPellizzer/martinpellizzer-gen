    "intro": "Biota ericoides, commonly known as the common heath, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in the spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and pine barrens. Biota ericoides plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its environment."
