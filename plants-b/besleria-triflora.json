It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, adapting it to its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often blooming in the spring and summer. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Its foliage is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
