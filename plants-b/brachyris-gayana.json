    "intro": "Brachyris gayana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open grassland or woodland areas. The plant has a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are closely packed at the base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish or brownish and appear in early spring. Brachyris gayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
