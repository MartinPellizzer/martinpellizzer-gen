    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. typicum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Botrychium simplex var. typicum is a perennial plant that thrives in cool, humid climates."
