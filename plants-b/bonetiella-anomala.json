    "intro": "Bonetiella anomala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique structure with a single, fleshy stem and two elongated, leaf-like structures called pseudobulbs. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that resembles a ghostly face. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
