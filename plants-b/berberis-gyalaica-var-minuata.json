    "intro": "Berberis gyalaica var. minuata, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features slender, wiry stems that often trail or creep along the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a bluish-green hue on top and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
