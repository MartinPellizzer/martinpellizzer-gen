    "intro": "Bossiaea heterophylla var. stenoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish or reddish flowers in clusters, which attract nectar-feeding insects. It is typically found in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf size and floral structure compared to other varieties of Bossiaea heterophylla."
