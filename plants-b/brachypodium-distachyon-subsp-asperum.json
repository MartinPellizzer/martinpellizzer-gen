    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon subsp. asperum, commonly known as rough bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, tufted growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces dense spikes of small, two-flowered spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a valuable model organism for studying grass genetics and adaptation."
