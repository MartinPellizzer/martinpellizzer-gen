    "intro": "Bolbitis ovata, commonly known as the spoon fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate-shaped fronds that resemble a spoon, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces aerial roots and can form dense mats or small clumps. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Bolbitis ovata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
