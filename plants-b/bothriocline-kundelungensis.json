It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale blue flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
