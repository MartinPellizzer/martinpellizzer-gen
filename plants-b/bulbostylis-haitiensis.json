    "intro": "Bulbostylis haitiensis, commonly known as the Haitian bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti, and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
