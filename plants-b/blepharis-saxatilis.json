    "intro": "Blepharis saxatilis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Blepharis saxatilis is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
