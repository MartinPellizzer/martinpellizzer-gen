    "intro": "Bromelia muricata, commonly known as the spiny bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are covered in small, sharp spines, which provide protection against herbivores. Bromelia muricata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance."
