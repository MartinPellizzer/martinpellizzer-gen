It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. Bromus erectus var. gracilis is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
