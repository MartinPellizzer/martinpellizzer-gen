    "intro": "Betula alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska birch, is a deciduous tree native to the subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula alaskana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
