It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant has greyish-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
