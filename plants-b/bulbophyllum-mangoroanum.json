    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mangoroanum, commonly known as the Mangoroan Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. This orchid is noted for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
