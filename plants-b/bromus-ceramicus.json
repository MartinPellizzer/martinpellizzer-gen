    "intro": "Bromus ceramicus, commonly known as the ceramic brome, is a species of grass native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous narrow, awned lemmas. Its leaves are usually narrow and rough, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus ceramicus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
