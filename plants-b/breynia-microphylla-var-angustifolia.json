    "intro": "Breynia microphylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved breynia, is a succulent shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to conserve water. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a notable species in xerophytic ecosystems."
