    "intro": "Blechnum aequatoriense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The spore-producing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
