    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian brome, is a grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and slender, linear leaves. The plant typically produces spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in agricultural areas and can be both a weed and a forage plant."
