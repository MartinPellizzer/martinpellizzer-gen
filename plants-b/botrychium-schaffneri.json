    "intro": "Botrychium schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's moonwort, is a small fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing sorus that is covered by a unique, helmet-like structure called a indusium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fronds are simple and pinnately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Botrychium schaffneri plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
