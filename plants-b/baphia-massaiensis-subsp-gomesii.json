It is native to eastern Africa, particularly found in Kenya and Tanzania, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in small inflorescences, and its pods are typically slender and hairy. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
