It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical form. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale blue or white, with a distinctive three-lobed throat. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
