    "intro": "Brachystegia luishiensis, commonly known as the Luishi teak, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical rainforests of central Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
