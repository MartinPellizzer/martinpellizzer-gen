    "intro": "Buxus retusa, commonly known as the smooth boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus retusa is often used in horticulture for topiary and as a foundation plant due to its hardiness and ability to maintain shape. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
