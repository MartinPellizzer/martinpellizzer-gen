    "intro": "Brachyclados pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf broom, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Brachyclados pygmaeus is well-suited to poor, well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
