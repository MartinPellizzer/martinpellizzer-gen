    "intro": "Bolandra oregana var. imnahaensis, commonly known as the Imnaha valley bitterroot, is a variant of the bitterroot plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and clustered, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its historical significance to Indigenous communities."
