    "intro": "Betula alnoides, commonly known as the alnoid birch, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that often peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. Betula alnoides is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas."
