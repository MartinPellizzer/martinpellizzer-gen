    "intro": "Berberis ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon barberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Asia, including Sri Lanka and India. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The berries contain berberine, a compound used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
