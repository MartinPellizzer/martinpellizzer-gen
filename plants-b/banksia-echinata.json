    "intro": "Banksia echinata, commonly known as the spinifex banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or spiky flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia echinata thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and dry inland environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species."
