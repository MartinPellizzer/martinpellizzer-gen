    "intro": "Bouteloua multiseta var. pallida, commonly known as the pale dropseed, is a low-growing, clump-forming grass native to the central and southern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a distinctive white or silver-tipped appearance along the leaf margins. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to brown seed heads in late summer, which are often used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping. Its fine texture and upright growth habit make it an excellent choice for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
