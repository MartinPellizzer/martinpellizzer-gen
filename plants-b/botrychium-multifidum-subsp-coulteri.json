    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum subsp. coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's moonwort, is a fern species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
