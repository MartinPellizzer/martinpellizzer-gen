    "intro": "Bignonia radicans var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple trumpet vine, is a vigorous, climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically a deep green, with a distinctive purple or bronze tinge on the underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from orange to red, often with a contrasting purple throat. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rapid growth, it is often used as a decorative climber but can become invasive if not properly managed."
