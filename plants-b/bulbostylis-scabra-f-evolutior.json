    "intro": "Bulbostylis scabra f. evolutior, commonly known as the woolly bulbostylis, is a rare grass species characterized by its densely hairy, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It belongs to the family Poaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its ecological role in supporting local insect populations. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
