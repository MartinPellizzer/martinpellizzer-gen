    "intro": "Balanophora valida, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host through specialized roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on the roots of other plants in tropical forests. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically blooming in clusters, and it is of interest to botanists due to its unique parasitic lifestyle."
