    "intro": "Betula davurica var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin layers to reveal a lighter-colored inner bark. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments."
