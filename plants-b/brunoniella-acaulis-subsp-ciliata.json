    "intro": "Brunoniella acaulis subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in dense spikes during spring. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its subspecies-specific features include ciliate (fringed) margins on the leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the genus."
