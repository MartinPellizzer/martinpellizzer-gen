    "intro": "Beilschmiedia kochummenii, commonly known as the Kuchummen beilschmiedia, is a member of the Lauraceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy flowers. Native to the rainforests of Borneo, this evergreen tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201320 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, often with a glossy surface and a strong, spicy scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
