    "intro": "Bolbitis sinuosa var. foxii, commonly known as the Fox's shield fern, is a variant of the sinuous shield fern native to the eastern United States. It is a rhizomatous fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
