It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
