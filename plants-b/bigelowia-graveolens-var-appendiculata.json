    "intro": "Bigelowia graveolens var. appendiculata, commonly known as the fragrant sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces yellowish-orange seeds that are dispersed by wind, and its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in dry landscapes."
