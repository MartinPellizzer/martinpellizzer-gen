    "intro": "Borzicactus cajamarcensis, commonly known as the Cajamarca cactus, is a species native to the Andean region of Peru. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments at high altitudes. It produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
