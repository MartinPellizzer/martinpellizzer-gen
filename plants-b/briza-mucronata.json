    "intro": "Briza mucronata, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Briza mucronata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
