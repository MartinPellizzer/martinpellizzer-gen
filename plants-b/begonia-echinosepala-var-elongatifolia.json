    "intro": "Begonia echinosepala var. elongatifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
