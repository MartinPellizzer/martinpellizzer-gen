    "intro": "Bumelia obovata var. portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican bumelia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
