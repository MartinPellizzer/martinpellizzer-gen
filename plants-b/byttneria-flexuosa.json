It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems that can climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that resemble small figs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Byttneria flexuosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some regions for medicinal purposes."
