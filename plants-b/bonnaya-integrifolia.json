    "intro": "Bonnaya integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, making it well adapted to coastal dunes and tidal zones. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bonnaya integrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens along the coast."
