    "intro": "Betula ganjuensis, commonly known as the Ganju birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
