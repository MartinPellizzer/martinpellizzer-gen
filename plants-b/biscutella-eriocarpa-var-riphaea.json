    "intro": "Biscutella eriocarpa var. riphaea, commonly known as the woolly biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
