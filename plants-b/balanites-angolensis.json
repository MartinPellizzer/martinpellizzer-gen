    "intro": "Balanites angolensis, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small, deciduous shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and yellow, fleshy fruits that contain a high amount of oils. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its fruit is used by both humans and animals, and the seeds can be processed into a nutritious paste. Balanites angolensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local wildlife."
