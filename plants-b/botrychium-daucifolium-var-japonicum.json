    "intro": "Botrychium daucifolium var. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the Botrychiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lanceolate segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. This variant is native to East Asia and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
