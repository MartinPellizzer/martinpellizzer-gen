    "intro": "Begonia boquetensis, commonly known as the Bouquet's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
