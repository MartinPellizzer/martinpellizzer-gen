    "intro": "Brassavola suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are known for their delicate, sweet aroma that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths."
