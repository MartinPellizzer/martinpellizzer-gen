It is characterized by its wide, bluish-green leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. The plant produces fluffy, silver-gray seed heads that are often mistaken for wheat or other grains. It is drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects. Broadleaf bluestem plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
