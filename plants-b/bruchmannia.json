    "intro": "Bruchmannia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to Central and South America, where they thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Bruchmannia species are characterized by their striking, showy inflorescences that often resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. They typically grow as epiphytes or terrestrial plants, often found in shaded, humid environments. The genus includes several species, such as Bruchmannia hortae and Bruchmannia bermudiana, which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
