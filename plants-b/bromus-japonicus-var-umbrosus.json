    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadow wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple florets, which are typical of the Bromus genus. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
