    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 harcynica, commonly known as the Harcynica birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula jacquemontii (Jacquemont's birch). It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, weeping habit, making it a striking ornamental tree. The plant is native to the Carpathian Mountains and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Betula \u00d7 harcynica is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique form and seasonal interest."
