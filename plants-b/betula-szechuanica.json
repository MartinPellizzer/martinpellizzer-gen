    "intro": "Betula szechuanica, commonly known as the Sichuan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, followed by oval, greenish-yellow leaves that turn reddish in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Betula szechuanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
