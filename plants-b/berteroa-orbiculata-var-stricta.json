    "intro": "Berteroa orbiculata var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry slopes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
