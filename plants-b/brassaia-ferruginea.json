    "intro": "Brassaia ferruginea, commonly known as the rust-colored hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red flowers, which bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Brassaia ferruginea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
