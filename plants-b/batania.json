    "intro": "Batania, commonly known as the bat flower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy blossoms that range in color from deep purple to bright pink. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to two meters. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slight hairy texture. Batania thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
