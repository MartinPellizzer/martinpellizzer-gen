    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian squarrosy brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it common in coastal and inland regions. This variety is often found in open habitats such as dunes, plains, and disturbed soils."
