    "intro": "Betula sunanensis, commonly known as the Sunan birch, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Betula sunanensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
