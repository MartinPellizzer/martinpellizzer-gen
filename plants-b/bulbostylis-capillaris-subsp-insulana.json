    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris subsp. insulana, commonly known as the insular bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific island habitats in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
