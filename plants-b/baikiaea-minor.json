    "intro": "Baikiaea minor, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. Baikiaea minor is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
