    "intro": "Bauhinia tortuosa, commonly known as the \"Bauhinia tree\" or \"peacock flower,\" is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming in clusters. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Bauhinia tortuosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
