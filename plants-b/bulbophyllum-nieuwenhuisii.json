    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nieuwenhuisii, commonly known as the Nieuwenhuis's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent lip structures typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
