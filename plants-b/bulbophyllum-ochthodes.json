    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ochthodes, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry environments it often inhabits. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects."
