    "intro": "Begonia fasciculiflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or container gardening. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental purposes. Begonia fasciculiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
