    "intro": "Bidens hirsuta, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are covered in tiny hooks, allowing them to attach to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Bidens hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some regions."
