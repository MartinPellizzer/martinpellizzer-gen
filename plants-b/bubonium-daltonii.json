    "intro": "Bubonium daltonii, commonly known as the Dalton's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent white petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically growing on the forest floor or in thick undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Bubonium daltonii is considered critically endangered and is protected in many regions."
