    "intro": "Boehmeria caudata var. scabrella, commonly known as the hairy nettle, is a variant of the Boehmeria genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its fibrous, rhizomatous growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. This plant is valued for its strong, fibrous stalks, which have been traditionally used in textile production and as a source of natural fiber."
