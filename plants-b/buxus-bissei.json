    "intro": "Buxus bissei, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape. The plant typically reaches a height of about 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for use in topiary and hedging. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, requiring regular pruning to maintain its shape. Buxus bissei is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
