    "intro": "Betula wutaica, commonly known as the Wutaica birch, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a medium-sized deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, white bark that often develops fissures with age. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged nuts. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine forests."
