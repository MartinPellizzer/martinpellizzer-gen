    "intro": "Bradburya floridana, commonly known as the Florida bradburya, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the wetlands of Florida. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in marshy areas along the coast. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is critically endangered and protected under conservation programs. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species for wetland ecosystems."
