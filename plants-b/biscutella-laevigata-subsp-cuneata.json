    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in meadows and slopes at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
