It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
