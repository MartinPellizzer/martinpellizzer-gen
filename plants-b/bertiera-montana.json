    "intro": "Bertiera montana, commonly known as the mountain bertiera, is a shrub native to the high elevations of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Bertiera montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and unique appearance."
