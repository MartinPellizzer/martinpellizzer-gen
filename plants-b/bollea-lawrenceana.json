    "intro": "Bollea lawrenceana, commonly known as the Lawrence's bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring into early summer."
