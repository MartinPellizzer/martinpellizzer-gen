    "intro": "Bryonia amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clinging bryony, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and features heart-shaped leaves that often wrap around stems or other structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
