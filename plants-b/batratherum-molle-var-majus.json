    "intro": "Batratherum molle var. majus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
