It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Braya meyeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
