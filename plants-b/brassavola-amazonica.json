    "intro": "Brassavola amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Brassavola amazonica is considered endangered in some regions."
