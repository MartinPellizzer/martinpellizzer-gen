    "intro": "Bacopa tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf waterhyssop, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Bacopa tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
