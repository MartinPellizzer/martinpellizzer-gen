    "intro": "Becium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf becium, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, red berries. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy coastal plant. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
