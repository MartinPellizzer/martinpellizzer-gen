    "intro": "Bulbophyllum meliphagirostrum, commonly known as the honey-beak orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers with a unique shape resembling a bird's beak. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a common feature among epiphytic orchids. The flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a mix of white, yellow, and green hues."
