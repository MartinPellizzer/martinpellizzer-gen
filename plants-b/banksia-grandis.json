    "intro": "Banksia grandis, commonly known as the boomerang banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color and bloom in spring. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Banksia grandis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly nectar-feeding birds and insects."
