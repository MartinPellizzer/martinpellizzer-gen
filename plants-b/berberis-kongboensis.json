    "intro": "Berberis kongboensis, commonly known as the Bhutan barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan, India, and Nepal. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. Its small, yellow flowers appear in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Berberis kongboensis is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide both ecological and aesthetic benefits in mountainous landscapes."
