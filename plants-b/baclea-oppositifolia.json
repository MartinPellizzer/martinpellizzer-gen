It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Baclea oppositifolia is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
