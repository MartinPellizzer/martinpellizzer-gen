It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Berkheya speciosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
