    "intro": "Betula utilis var. jacquemontii, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in mountainous regions with cold climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its unique visual characteristics."
