    "intro": "Bigelovia linifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf bigelovia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
