    "intro": "Buxus handsworthii, commonly known as the Handsworth boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains lush throughout the year, making it highly ornamental. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedging plant. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is a popular choice for formal garden designs."
