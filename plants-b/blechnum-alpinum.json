    "intro": "Blechnum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, strap-like fronds that are often recurved. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in alpine and subalpine zones. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in rocky or soil-rich substrates. Blechnum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural requirements."
