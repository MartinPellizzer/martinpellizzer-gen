    "intro": "Betula utilis var. prattii, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and green beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
