It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features tiny, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Bacopa valerii is known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural applications."
