    "intro": "Brunfelsia obovata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved angel's trumpets, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and often rough-textured leaves, which give it its varietal name \"coriacea.\" The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, blooming in the evening. These flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a history of use in traditional medicine."
