    "intro": "Bulbophyllum frostii, commonly known as the Frost's Ghost Orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent greenish-white flowers and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of ghostly shapes. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
