    "intro": "Botryanthus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic starflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in dune ecosystems. Botryanthus atlanticus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
