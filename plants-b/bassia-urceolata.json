    "intro": "Bassia urceolata, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it produces seed pods that split open to release seeds. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to hot, dry environments. It has a low-growing habit with fleshy, succulent-like leaves that help it conserve water. Bassia urceolata is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in desert ecosystems."
