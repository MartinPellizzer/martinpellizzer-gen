    "intro": "Bulbine capensis, commonly known as the Cape bulbous plant, is a succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
