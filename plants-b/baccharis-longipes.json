    "intro": "Baccharis longipes, commonly known as the longstem baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Baccharis longipes is often found in coastal dunes, sand plains, and other xeric habitats."
