    "intro": "Butonica terrestris, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-green hue. Butonica terrestris thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
