It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often appear to be covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a distinctive bluish-green color. Boerhavia africana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
