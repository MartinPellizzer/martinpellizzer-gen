    "intro": "Buphthalmum scabrum, commonly known as the rough-eyed mullein, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Buphthalmum scabrum is often found in dry, sunny habitats like rocky soils and disturbed areas."
