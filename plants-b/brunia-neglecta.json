    "intro": "Brunia neglecta, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round berries. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
