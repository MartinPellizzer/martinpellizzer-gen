    "intro": "Barleria lancifolia subsp. lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barleria, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy along the margins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
