    "intro": "Bulbophyllum carinilabium, commonly known as the Ridge-lipped Batswing Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and showy, lip-like petals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
