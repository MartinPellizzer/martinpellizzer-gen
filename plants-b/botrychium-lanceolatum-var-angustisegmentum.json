    "intro": "Botrychium lanceolatum var. angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a small, heart-shaped sorus that is covered by a protective indusium, typical of the Ophioglossaceae family. The plant has a creeping rhizome with a single leaf, which is divided into segments that are narrow and lanceolate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaf segments compared to other varieties within the species."
