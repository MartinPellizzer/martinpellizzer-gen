    "intro": "Borya scirpoidea, commonly known as the marsh borya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming from late spring to early summer. Borya scirpoidea thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Its flowering structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
