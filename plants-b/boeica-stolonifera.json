    "intro": "Boeica stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Boeica stolonifera thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
