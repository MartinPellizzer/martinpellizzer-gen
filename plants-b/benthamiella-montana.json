It belongs to the family Montiniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has a short growing season and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
