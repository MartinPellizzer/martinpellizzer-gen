    "intro": "Breynia thorelii, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are thick and store water, making it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments. Breynia thorelii is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant for landscaping in dry climates."
