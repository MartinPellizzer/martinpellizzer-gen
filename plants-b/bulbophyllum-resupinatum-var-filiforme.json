    "intro": "Bulbophyllum resupinatum var. filiforme, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, thin pseudobulbs that support its climbing growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate, often fragrant petals. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. This variety is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively manageable care requirements."
