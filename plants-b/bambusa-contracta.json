    "intro": "Bambusa contracta, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming grass species native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that grow to a height of about 2 to 3 meters, making it ideal for small spaces. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Bambusa contracta is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and as a sustainable building material in some regions."
