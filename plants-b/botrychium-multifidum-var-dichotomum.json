    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. dichotomum, commonly known as the forked moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous fronds. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The sporangia are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
