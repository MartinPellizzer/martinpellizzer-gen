    "intro": "Boopis scapigera var. ventosa, commonly known as the Ventosa bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. The variety ventosa is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Boopis scapigera."
