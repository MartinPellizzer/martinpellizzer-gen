    "intro": "Brachypodium brachystachyum, commonly known as the short-stalked false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale green to brownish flowers, which are clustered in dense, narrow spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight blue-gray hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Brachypodium brachystachyum is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils."
