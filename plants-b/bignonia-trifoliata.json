    "intro": "Bignonia trifoliata, commonly known as the crossvine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive red or orange throat, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
