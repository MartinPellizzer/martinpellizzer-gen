    "intro": "Buddleja alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Butterfly Bush, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Buddleja alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
