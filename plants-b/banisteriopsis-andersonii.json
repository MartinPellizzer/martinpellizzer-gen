    "intro": "Banisteriopsis andersonii, commonly known as the Amazonian miracle fruit, is a climbing plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy berries. These berries contain a single seed and are known for their intense, sour taste, which can be overwhelming to the human palate. Despite its bitter flavor, the fruit has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
