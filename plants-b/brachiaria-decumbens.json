    "intro": "Brachiaria decumbens, commonly known as horse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in grasslands and pastures. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is widely used for forage and soil stabilization."
