    "intro": "Barringtonia confusa, commonly known as the whitebeard tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The tree produces a unique, spherical fruit that splits open when mature, releasing seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. Its leaves are typically large, alternate, and have a rough, textured surface. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in some regions."
