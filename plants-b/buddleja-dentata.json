    "intro": "Buddleja dentata, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and its showy, panicle-like inflorescences that produce clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The flowers are typically pale lavender to pink in color and attract a wide variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
