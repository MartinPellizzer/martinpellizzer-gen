    "intro": "Borya jabirabela, commonly known as the golden borya, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borya jabirabela is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
