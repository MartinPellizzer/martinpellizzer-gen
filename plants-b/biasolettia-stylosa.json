    "intro": "Biasolettia stylosa, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated pods containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control in dry regions."
