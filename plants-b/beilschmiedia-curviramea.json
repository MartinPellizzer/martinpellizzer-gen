    "intro": "Beilschmiedia curviramea, commonly known as the curved-veined beilschmiedia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in the understory of humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate, and elliptical leaves with a smooth surface and prominent venation. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in panicle inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. The fruit is a small, dark purple drupe that contains a single seed, contributing to its role in seed dispersal by animals."
