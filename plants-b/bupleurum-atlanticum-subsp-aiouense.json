    "intro": "Bupleurum atlanticum subsp. aiouense, commonly known as the Atlantic bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coast, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant features slender, branching stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering habits compared to other Bupleurum species."
