It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which are typically 5 to 7 cm in diameter, giving it a striking appearance. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Babingtonia pluriflora is well adapted to the dry conditions of its native habitat, with deep roots that help it survive in arid environments."
