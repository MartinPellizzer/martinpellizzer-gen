    "intro": "Botrychium pallidum, commonly known as the pale moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia, which are clustered in a central umbel. Botrychium pallidum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a relatively small fern, typically growing to a height of less than 10 centimeters."
