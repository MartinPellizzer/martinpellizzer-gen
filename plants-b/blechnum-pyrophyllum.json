    "intro": "Blechnum pyrophyllum, commonly known as the flame fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright red or orange fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a leathery texture and a vibrant coloration that persists even when dry. Blechnum pyrophyllum is also notable for its ability to withstand fire, which is an adaptation to its native habitat."
