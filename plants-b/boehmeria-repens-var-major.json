    "intro": "Boehmeria repens var. major, commonly known as the creeping bamboo or giant nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its fibrous, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is valued for its strong, fibrous stems, which are used in traditional crafts and papermaking. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a common weed in tropical regions."
