    "intro": "Bromus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican brome, is a perennial grass native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid environments. Bromus mexicanus is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and adaptability."
