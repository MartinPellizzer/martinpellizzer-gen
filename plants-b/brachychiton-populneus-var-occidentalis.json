    "intro": "Brachychiton populneus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western bottle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, pendant clusters of yellow flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in warm climates."
