    "intro": "Bulbophyllum zaratananae subsp. disjunctum, commonly known as the Disjunct Bulbophyllum, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
