    "intro": "Betula rezniczenkoana var. obiquesquamata, commonly known as the narrow-scaled birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and closely arranged leaf scales, which give it its scientific name. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and has a slender, often multi-stemmed growth form. Its bark is typically smooth and pale, with a texture that becomes fissured as the tree matures. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
