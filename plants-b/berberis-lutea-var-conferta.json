    "intro": "Berberis lutea var. conferta, commonly known as the dense yellow barberry, is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and vibrant yellow foliage. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Native to the Himalayas, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for hedges and garden borders."
