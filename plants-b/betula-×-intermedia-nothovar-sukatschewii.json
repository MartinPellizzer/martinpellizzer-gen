    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 intermedia nothovar. sukatschewii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, light-colored bark. It exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Betula pendula and Betula platyphylla, including a broad, spreading crown and a relatively fast growth rate. The leaves are typically triangular with serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions of Asia, particularly in China. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
