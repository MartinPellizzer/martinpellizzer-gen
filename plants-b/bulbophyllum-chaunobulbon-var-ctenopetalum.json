    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chaunobulbon var. ctenopetalum, commonly known as the feather-petaled ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with intricate, feather-like petals and sepals. It thrives in tropical rainforests, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
