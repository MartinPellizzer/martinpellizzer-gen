    "intro": "Betula perfiljevii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a lighter inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has slender, often weeping branches and produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula perfiljevii is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soil and cold temperatures."
