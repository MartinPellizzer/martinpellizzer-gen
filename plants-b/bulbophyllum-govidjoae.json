    "intro": "Bulbophyllum govidjoae, commonly known as the Govejoa orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with vibrant colors, often in shades of yellow and orange. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
