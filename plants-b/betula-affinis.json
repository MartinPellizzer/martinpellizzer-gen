    "intro": "Betula affinis, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer. The tree typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters and has slender, pendulous branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with serrated edges. Betula affinis produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
