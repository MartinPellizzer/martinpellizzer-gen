    "intro": "Bursa grossa, commonly known as the large burr plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique feature is the development of large, woody burrs that enclose the seeds, aiding in wind and animal dispersal. Bursa grossa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
