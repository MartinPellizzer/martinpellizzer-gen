    "intro": "Breynia lithophila, commonly known as the rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces, forming a dense mat or shrub. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Breynia lithophila is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
