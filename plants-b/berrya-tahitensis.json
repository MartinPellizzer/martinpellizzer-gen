It is native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form with thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible and have a tangy, slightly acidic flavor. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and unique fruit, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical regions."
