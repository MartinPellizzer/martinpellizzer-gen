    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to the boreal and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing form, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and often reddish-brown, and it thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Betula pubescens var. pumila plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native environment."
