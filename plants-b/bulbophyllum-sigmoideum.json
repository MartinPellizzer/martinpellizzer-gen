    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sigmoideum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
