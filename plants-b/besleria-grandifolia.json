It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble flames, with bright red or orange petals and a contrasting yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Besleria grandifolia is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or warm climates."
