    "intro": "Bandeiraea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It includes several species, the most notable being Bandeiraea simplicifolia, which is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Bandeiraea is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the crafting of musical instruments and furniture."
