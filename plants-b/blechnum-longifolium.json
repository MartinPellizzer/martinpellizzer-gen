    "intro": "Blechnum longifolium, commonly known as the longleaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds that often grow in a rosette pattern. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
