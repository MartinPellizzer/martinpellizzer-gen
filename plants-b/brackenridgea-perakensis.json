    "intro": "Brackenridgea perakensis, commonly known as the Perak orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The Perak orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
