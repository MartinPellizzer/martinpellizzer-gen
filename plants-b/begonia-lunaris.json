    "intro": "Begonia lunaris, commonly known as the moon begonia, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that often display a silvery or white margin, giving it a moonlit appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Begonia lunaris thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
