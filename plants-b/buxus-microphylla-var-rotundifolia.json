    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is well-suited for topiary and hedging due to its slow growth and ability to tolerate pruning. Its foliage remains dense and uniform throughout the year, making it a popular choice in formal garden designs."
