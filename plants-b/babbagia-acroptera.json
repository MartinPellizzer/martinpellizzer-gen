    "intro": "Babbagia acroptera, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Babbagia acroptera is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
