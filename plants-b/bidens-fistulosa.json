    "intro": "Bidens fistulosa, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two stamens, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Bidens fistulosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
