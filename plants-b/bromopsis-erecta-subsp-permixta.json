    "intro": "Bromopsis erecta subsp. permixta, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a compact cluster. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other bentgrass species. Bromopsis erecta subsp. permixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
