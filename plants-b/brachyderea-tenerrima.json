    "intro": "Brachyderea tenerrima, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow leaves and a single, delicate flower that can range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
