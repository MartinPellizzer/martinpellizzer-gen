    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 uliginosa, commonly known as the black spruce, is a hybrid conifer native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and conical shape, often found in wetland and bog habitats. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its needles are typically dark green and arranged in crossed pairs, while its roots form extensive networks that help stabilize peat soils. Betula \u00d7 uliginosa plays a crucial role in boreal and subarctic ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to carbon sequestration."
