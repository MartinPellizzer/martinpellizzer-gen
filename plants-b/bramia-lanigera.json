    "intro": "Bramia lanigera, commonly known as the woolly bramia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, foliage. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a distinctive velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. Bramia lanigera produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences."
