    "intro": "Begonia rhodotricha, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hairy trichomes, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Begonia rhodotricha is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in ecological systems within its native habitat."
