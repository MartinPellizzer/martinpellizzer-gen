    "intro": "Bromus tenuis, commonly known as slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. Bromus tenuis is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat creation for other plants."
