It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered with fine, sticky hairs, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This plant is drought-tolerant and has adaptations that allow it to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
