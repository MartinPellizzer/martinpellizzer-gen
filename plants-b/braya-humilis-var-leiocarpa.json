    "intro": "Braya humilis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture in dry environments. The flowers are usually white or pink, borne on short stalks and arranged in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to the plant. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This species is notable for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
