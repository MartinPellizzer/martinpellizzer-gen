    "intro": "Bunium macuca subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic fennel, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates with salt spray. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical features."
