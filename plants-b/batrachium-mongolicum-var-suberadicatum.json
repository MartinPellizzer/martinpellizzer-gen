    "intro": "Batrachium mongolicum var. suberadicatum, commonly known as the Mongolian batrachium, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the steppes of Mongolia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in arid to semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
