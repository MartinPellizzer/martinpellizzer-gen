It features slender, arching stems that produce clusters of fragrant, pale purple to lavender flowers in late summer. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a slightly hairy texture, and they turn yellow in autumn. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is also valued for its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
