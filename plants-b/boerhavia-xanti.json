    "intro": "Boerhavia xanti, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Boerhavia xanti is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
