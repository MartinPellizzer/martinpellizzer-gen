    "intro": "Betula alba var. fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri birch, is a variety of white birch native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
