    "intro": "Bituminaria antiatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic bituminaria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Bituminaria antiatlantica is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
