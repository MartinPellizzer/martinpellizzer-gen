    "intro": "Begonia bellii, commonly known as the bell-shaped begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, often resembling small bells. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, producing heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can last several months during the growing season."
