    "intro": "Betula pubescens nothovar. kusmisscheffii, commonly known as the Siberian white birch, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Betula pendula and Betula platyphylla. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, upright growth habit. The plant is native to the colder regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring and has small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to harsh climatic conditions."
