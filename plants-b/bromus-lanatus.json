    "intro": "Bromus lanatus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, grass-like inflorescences. Bromus lanatus is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
