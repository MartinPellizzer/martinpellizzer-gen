    "intro": "Begonia jenginensis, commonly known as the Jengin begonia, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a mix of green and red hues, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
