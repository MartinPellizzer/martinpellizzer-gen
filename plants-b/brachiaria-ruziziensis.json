    "intro": "Brachiaria ruziziensis, commonly known as ruzizi grass, is a perennial grass native to Africa, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used for forage in livestock farming. Additionally, it plays a role in soil stabilization and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
