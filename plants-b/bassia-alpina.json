    "intro": "Bassia alpina, commonly known as alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Bassia alpina is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions."
