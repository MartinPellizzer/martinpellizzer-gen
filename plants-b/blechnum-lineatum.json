    "intro": "Blechnum lineatum, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous upright fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, giving the plant its scientific name."
