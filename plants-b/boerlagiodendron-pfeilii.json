It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
