    "intro": "Bartlettina ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained soils. Bartlettina ehrenbergii plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
