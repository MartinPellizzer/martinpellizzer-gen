    "intro": "Bolbitis hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy scales. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost triangular appearance when fully mature. Bolbitis hookeriana thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and high-altitude regions."
