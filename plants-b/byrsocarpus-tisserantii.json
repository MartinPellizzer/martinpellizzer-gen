It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the genus Bursera. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
