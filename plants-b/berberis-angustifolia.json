    "intro": "Berberis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but have a sharp, astringent flavor. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Berberis angustifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens in temperate climates."
