    "intro": "Bergeranthus longisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepaled bergeranthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bergeranthus longisepalus is known for its showy, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in the spring and early summer."
