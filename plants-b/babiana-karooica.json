    "intro": "Babiana karooica, commonly known as the Karoo rain lily, is a bulbous geophyte native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and relies on seasonal rainfall for growth. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, adapting to the harsh, dry conditions of its natural habitat. Babiana karooica is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
