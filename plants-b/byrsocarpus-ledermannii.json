    "intro": "Byrsocarpus ledermannii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The fruit is a dry, capsule that splits open to release the seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the harsh desert environment."
