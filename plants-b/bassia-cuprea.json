    "intro": "Bassia cuprea, commonly known as copperleaf, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that range in color from green to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to drought-prone environments. Bassia cuprea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
