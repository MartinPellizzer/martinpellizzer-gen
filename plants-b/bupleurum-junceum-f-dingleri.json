    "intro": "Bupleurum junceum f. dingleri, commonly known as the Desert Bupleurum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are finely divided and gray-green in color, while its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in summer. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
