It is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptic, glaucous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, thriving in cooler, moist climates. It is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with specialized structures for pollination. Its subspecies status reflects genetic and morphological distinctions from other Boechera species."
