    "intro": "Bellidium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved bellidium, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, blooming in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a characteristic species of Mediterranean scrublands."
