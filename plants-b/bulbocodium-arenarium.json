    "intro": "Bulbocodium arenarium, commonly known as the sand bulbous, is a flowering plant native to sandy coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb that produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. The plant has a bulbous root system that helps it survive in arid and saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is often found in maritime climates."
