    "intro": "Bolbitis boivinii, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a striking fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically divided into long, narrow segments, giving it a unique, cascading appearance. Bolbitis boivinii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
