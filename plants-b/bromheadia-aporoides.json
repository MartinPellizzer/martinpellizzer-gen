    "intro": "Bromheadia aporoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy inflorescence composed of numerous white or pale yellow flowers. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot photosynthesize. Its delicate structure and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native range."
