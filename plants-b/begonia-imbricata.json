    "intro": "Begonia imbricata, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in horticulture."
