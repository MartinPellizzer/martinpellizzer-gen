    "intro": "Brugmansia zippelii, commonly known as the white angel's trumpet, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous, white flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially at night. The plant produces woody, branching stems and has large, heart-shaped, dark green leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
