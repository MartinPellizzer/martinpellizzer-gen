    "intro": "Bauhinia notophila, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a small to medium-sized leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, and often velvety leaves that are bipinnate, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Bauhinia notophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
