    "intro": "Borreria rosea, commonly known as the pink borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its pink to red flowers bloom during the warm season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Borreria rosea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
