    "intro": "Brasilianthus, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall stature, reaching up to 50 meters in height, and its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing multiple seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These nuts are rich in nutrients, particularly oils and proteins, and are commercially valuable. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
