    "intro": "Bignonia reticulata, commonly known as the yellow bellvista, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found growing along riverbanks and in woodland edges. Bignonia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
