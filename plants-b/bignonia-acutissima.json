    "intro": "Bignonia acutissima, commonly known as the cross vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a woody stem that can become quite thick over time, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
