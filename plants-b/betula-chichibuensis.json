    "intro": "Betula chichibuensis, commonly known as the Chichibu birch, is a rare deciduous tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its white bark and small, triangular leaves. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
