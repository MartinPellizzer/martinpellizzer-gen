    "intro": "Bermudiana bermudiana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass native to the subtropical regions of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. The plant typically grows in dense mats, forming a low-growing turf that is often used for erosion control and ornamental purposes. Its botanical features include small, spike-like inflorescences and narrow, elongated leaves with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in challenging environments."
