    "intro": "Beta decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a sprawling, decumbent stem that lies close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Beta decumbens is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
