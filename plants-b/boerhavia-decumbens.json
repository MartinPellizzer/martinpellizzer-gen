    "intro": "Boerhavia decumbens, commonly known as redroot sandplum, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas. It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Boerhavia decumbens is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
