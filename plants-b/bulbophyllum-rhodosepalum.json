    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rhodosepalum, commonly known as the pink-sepal orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its rhizomatous growth and pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with pink or red sepals and petals, often with a contrasting white or yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in many botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
