It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a serrated margin, while the stems are usually covered in fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and woodland areas."
