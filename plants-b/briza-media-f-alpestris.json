    "intro": "Briza media f. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine feathergrass, is a compact, clump-forming grass that thrives in open, sunny environments. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is a hardy perennial, often found in alpine and subalpine regions due to its cold tolerance and drought resistance. The plant's low-growing habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to create a soft, flowing texture in garden landscapes."
