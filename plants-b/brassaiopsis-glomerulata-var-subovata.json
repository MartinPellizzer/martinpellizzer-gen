    "intro": "Brassaiopsis glomerulata var. subovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate waxplant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for container gardening and prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and long-lasting blooms."
