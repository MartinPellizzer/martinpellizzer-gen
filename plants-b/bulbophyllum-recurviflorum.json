    "intro": "Bulbophyllum recurviflorum, commonly known as the recurved-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, recurved flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. Bulbophyllum recurviflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in horticulture due to its unique and vibrant floral display."
