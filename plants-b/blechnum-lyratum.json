    "intro": "Blechnum lyratum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are broadly lanceolate and have a silvery sheen due to the dense covering of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The silver fern is also popular as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
