It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape.

Bridelia montana is often found in rocky or sandy soils in woodland and shrubland habitats. It has some ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and seasonal flowering."
