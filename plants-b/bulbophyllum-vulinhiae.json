    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vulinhiae, commonly known as the Violet Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its small, pale violet flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant produces a single, elongated pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
