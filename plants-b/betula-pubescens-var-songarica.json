    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. songarica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a variant of the white birch native to northern regions of Asia and Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in taiga and boreal forest ecosystems."
