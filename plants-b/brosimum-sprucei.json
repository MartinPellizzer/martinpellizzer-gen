    "intro": "Brosimum sprucei, commonly known as the spruce's balsa, is a species of tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Its growth habit is typically tree-like, with a straight trunk and a broad canopy. Brosimum sprucei is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential economic importance in sustainable forestry."
