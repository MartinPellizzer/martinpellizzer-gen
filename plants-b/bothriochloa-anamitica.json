    "intro": "Bothriochloa anamitica, commonly known as the Ammitic grass, is a perennial bunchgrass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
