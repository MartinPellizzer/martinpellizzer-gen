    "intro": "Betula fruticosa subsp. extremiorientalis, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates with short growing seasons. This species is often found in tundra and taiga ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
