    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. atlantica, commonly known as Atlantic biscuitweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to maritime climates with high salt exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
