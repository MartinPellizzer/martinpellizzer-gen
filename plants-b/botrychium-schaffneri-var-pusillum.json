It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a short, horizontal rhizome with sporangia clustered in groups called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium schaffneri var. pusillum is an important species for studying fern evolution and ecological adaptation."
