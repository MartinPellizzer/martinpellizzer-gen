    "intro": "Billbergia oxypetala, commonly known as the sharp-leaf billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features vibrant, spiky leaves that form a rosette, creating a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
