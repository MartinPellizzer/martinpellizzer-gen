It features rosettes of thick, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, upright stems. Bergenia \u00d7 smithii is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in partial shade to full sun. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
