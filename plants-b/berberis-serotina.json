    "intro": "Berberis serotina, commonly known as the late barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits in the fall, which are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Berberis serotina is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
