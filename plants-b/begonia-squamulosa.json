    "intro": "Begonia squamulosa, commonly known as the silverleaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
