    "intro": "Bougainvillea longispinosa, commonly known as the long-spined bougainvillea, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled true flowers that are less showy than the bracts. Its stems are woody and covered with long, sharp spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. This evergreen shrub is popular in tropical and subtropical gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sunny conditions."
