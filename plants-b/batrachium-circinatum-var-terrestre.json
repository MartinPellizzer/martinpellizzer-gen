    "intro": "Batrachium circinatum var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pink and are borne on erect, slender spikes. This variety is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through its carnivorous behavior."
