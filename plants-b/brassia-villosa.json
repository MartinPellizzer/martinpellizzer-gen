It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brassia villosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
