    "intro": "Bulbophyllum restrepia, commonly known as the Restrepo's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions.
