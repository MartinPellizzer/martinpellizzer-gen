It is characterized by its striking pink to red bract-like flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces flat, elliptical pods that contain seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia elmeri is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
