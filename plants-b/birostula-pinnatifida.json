    "intro": "Birostula pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birostula, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. Birostula pinnatifida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
