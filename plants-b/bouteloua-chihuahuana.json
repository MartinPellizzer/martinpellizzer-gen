    "intro": "Bouteloua chihuahuana, commonly known as Chihuahua bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces fluffy, pale blue to grayish-white seed heads in late summer. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
