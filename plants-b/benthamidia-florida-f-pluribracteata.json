    "intro": "Benthamidia florida f. pluribracteata, commonly known as the Florida benthamidia, is a rare and unique hybrid plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swamps, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
