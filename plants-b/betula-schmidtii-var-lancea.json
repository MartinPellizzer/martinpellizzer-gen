    "intro": "Betula schmidtii var. lancea, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The bark of this species is smooth and often exhibits a white or pale gray color, which becomes fissured with age. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments."
