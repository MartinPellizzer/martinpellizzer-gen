    "intro": "Biscutella sempervirens var. elvira, commonly known as the Elvira biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. This variety is particularly hardy and suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
