    "intro": "Bromus carinatus var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Bromus carinatus var. maritimus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
