    "intro": "Biotia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved biotia, is a rare and unique member of the Lecanorales order. It is characterized by its distinctive, thick, and leathery thallus that often forms a crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with a central stipe and a broad, disc-like apothecium. Its reproductive structures are typically orange to reddish in color, and it produces ascospores that are released through the apothecium. Biotia macrophylla is typically found in humid, shaded environments, often on acidic substrates in temperate regions."
