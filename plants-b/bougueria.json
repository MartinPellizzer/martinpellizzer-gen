    "intro": "Bougueria, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are characterized by their thick, swollen stems that store water, making them well adapted to arid environments. The leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, while the flowers are clustered in umbels and come in various colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Bougueria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
