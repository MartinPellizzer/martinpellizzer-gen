    "intro": "Botrychium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Indian moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, underground rhizome with a short, erect shoot above ground. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sorus, which is typically located on the underside of the frond. Botrychium zeylanicum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a distinctive yet rare botanical specimen."
