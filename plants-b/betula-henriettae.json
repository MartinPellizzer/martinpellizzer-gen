    "intro": "Betula henriettae, commonly known as Henrietta's birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and delicate, triangular leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in catkins, and it reproduces primarily through wind pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Betula henriettae is considered a vulnerable species."
