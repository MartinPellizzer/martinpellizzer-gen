    "intro": "Bromidium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved bromeliad, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette. Bromidium brevifolium is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
