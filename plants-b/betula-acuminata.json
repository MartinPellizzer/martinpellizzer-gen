    "intro": "Betula acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It produces small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
