    "intro": "Bermudiana convoluta, commonly known as the Bermuda grass vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of southern Florida. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing along coastal areas and in disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
