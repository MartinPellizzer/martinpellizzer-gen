    "intro": "Blechnum cartilagineum var. normale, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically light green to brownish in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance."
