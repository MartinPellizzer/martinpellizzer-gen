    "intro": "Bulbophyllum taeniophyllum var. denticulatoalatum, commonly known as the toothed-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome and multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a distinctive, intricate pattern on the petals and sepals. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
