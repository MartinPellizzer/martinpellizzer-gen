    "intro": "Betula divaricata, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and orange underneath. The tree typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters, with slender, branching limbs and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
