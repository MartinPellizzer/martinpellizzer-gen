    "intro": "Borreria nana, commonly known as dwarf borreria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring compact, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are often clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Borreria nana is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
