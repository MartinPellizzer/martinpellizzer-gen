    "intro": "Bidens oligoflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in roadside ditches. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens oligoflora is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
