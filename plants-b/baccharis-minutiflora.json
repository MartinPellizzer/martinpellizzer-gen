    "intro": "Baccharis minutiflora, commonly known as greenbriar or Mexican baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a strong scent when crushed, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Baccharis minutiflora is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
