    "intro": "Bradburya schottii, commonly known as the Schott's bradburya, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and thrives in high-altitude habitats. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Bradburya schottii is considered a conservation concern."
