    "intro": "Brasenia peltata, commonly known as the velvetleaf water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, often with a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the substrate. Brasenia peltata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
