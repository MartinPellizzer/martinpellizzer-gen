    "intro": "Blechnum longifolium var. robustius, commonly known as the robust fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent in certain conditions, contributing to its unique ecological role in its habitat."
