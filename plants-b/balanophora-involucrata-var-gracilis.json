    "intro": "Balanophora involucrata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically borne on slender stems. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
