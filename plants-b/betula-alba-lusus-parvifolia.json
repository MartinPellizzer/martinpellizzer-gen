    "intro": "Betula alba lusus parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a rare variant of the white birch. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical white birch. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a cupule, which are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and pale, similar to other birch species, but it tends to develop fissures as the tree matures. This plant is often found in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in shaded or semi-shaded conditions."
