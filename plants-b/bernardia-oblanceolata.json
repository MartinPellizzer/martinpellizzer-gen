    "intro": "Bernardia oblanceolata, commonly known as the slender-leafed bernardia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features simple, alternate, ovate to oblong leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Bernardia oblanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
