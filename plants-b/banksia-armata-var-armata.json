It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
