    "intro": "Boerhavia thornberi, commonly known as the desert bluemink, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Boerhavia thornberi plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
