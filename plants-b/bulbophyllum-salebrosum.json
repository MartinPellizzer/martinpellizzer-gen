    "intro": "Bulbophyllum salebrosum, commonly known as the Sago Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are typically dark green and sword-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bulbophyllum salebrosum is often cultivated for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
