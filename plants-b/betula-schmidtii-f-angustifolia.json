    "intro": "Betula schmidtii f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf birch, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the birch genus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant exhibits a distinctive bark that is smooth and pale, often with a slight peeling texture. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions of East Asia. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
