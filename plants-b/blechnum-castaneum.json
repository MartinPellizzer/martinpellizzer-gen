    "intro": "Blechnum castaneum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that are divided into narrow, grass-like segments. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its tall, elegant appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Blechnum castaneum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
