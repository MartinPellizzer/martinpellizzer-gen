    "intro": "Buddleja delavayi, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to western China. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink to purple. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, ornamental plant. Buddleja delavayi is also valued for its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
