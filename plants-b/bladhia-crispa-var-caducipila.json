    "intro": "Bladhia crispa var. caducipila, commonly known as the hairy bladhia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a similar hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders."
