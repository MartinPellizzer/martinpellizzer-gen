    "intro": "Bonamia semidigyna var. farinacea, commonly known as the sticky bonamia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that secrete a viscous substance, which can trap small insects. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The sticky secretions of this plant have been studied for their potential use in natural pest control."
