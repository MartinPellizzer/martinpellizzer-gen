    "intro": "Bambusa naibunensis, commonly known as the Japanese timber bamboo, is a tall, clumping bamboo species native to Japan. It features slender, green culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a smooth, pale surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is primarily valued for its strong, durable wood. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated for ornamental and timber purposes."
