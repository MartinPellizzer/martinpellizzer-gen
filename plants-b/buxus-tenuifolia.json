    "intro": "Buxus tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, dark green leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its hardy nature and ability to maintain shape make it a favored ornamental plant in gardens."
