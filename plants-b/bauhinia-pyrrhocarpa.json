    "intro": "Bauhinia pyrrhocarpa, commonly known as the red-veined bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves with red veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Bauhinia pyrrhocarpa is adapted to dry environments and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
