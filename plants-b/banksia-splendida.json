    "intro": "Banksia splendida, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical spikes. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs. Banksia splendida is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in local ecosystems."
