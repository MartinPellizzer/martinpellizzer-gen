    "intro": "Brachypodium montanum, commonly known as mountain bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Brachypodium montanum is often used in ecological studies due to its resilience and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
