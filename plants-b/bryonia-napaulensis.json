    "intro": "Bryonia napaulensis, commonly known as Indian bryony, is a climbing plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a rough, spiny capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
