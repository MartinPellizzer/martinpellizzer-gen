    "intro": "Bulbophyllum paullum, commonly known as the Paul's orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet fragrance. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less favorable conditions. The flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the rainy season."
