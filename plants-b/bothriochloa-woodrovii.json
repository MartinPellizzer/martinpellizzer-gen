It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife."
