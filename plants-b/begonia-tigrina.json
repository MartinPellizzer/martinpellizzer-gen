    "intro": "Begonia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that feature dark green veins resembling a tiger's stripes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia tigrina is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and ease of care."
