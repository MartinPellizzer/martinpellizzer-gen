    "intro": "Bermudiana iridifolia, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces capsules containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Bermudiana iridifolia is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
