    "intro": "Bolbitis subcrenata var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. This plant thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often growing in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The varietal form 'prolifera' is distinguished by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats. It is valued in ornamental aquatic gardens for its delicate appearance and ease of cultivation."
