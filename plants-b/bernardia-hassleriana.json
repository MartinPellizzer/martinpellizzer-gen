    "intro": "Bernardia hassleriana, commonly known as the Chilean rosewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain smooth, dark brown seeds. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
