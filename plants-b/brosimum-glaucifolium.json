    "intro": "Brosimum glaucifolium, commonly known as the white-leafed balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark is fibrous and has been historically used for various purposes, including the production of lightweight materials. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
