It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets that resemble petals, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. Bigelowia drummondii is often found in open habitats and can be an important component of local flora in its native range."
