    "intro": "Botrychium virginicum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a fleshy, spore-bearing sorus that is often covered by a protective leaf-like structure called a indusium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually divided into two parts, with the upper leaf being more prominent and often shaped like a shield. Botrychium virginicum is a perennial plant that can be found throughout much of North America."
