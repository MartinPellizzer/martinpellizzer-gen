    "intro": "Braya thorild-wulffii subsp. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies glabrata is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
