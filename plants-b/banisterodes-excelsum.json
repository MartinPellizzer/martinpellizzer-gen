    "intro": "Banisterodes excelsum, commonly known as the giant banister, is a striking climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant can grow up to 10 meters in length, making it one of the tallest climbers in its habitat. Its stems are woody and covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps protect it from herbivores. Banisterodes excelsum is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests, where it thrives in the humid, nutrient-rich environment."
