    "intro": "Blechnum fuscosquamosum, commonly known as the black-scale harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green fronds that are often covered in a layer of dark, velvety scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips."
