    "intro": "Bachmannia major, commonly known as the large beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Bachmannia major is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
