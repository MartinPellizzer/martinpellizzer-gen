    "intro": "Betula kwangsiensis subsp. fansipanensis, commonly known as the Fansipan birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunks and lanceolate, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant prefers cool, moist climates and is typically found at high altitudes in cloud forests. Its flowers are catkins, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its high-altitude environment."
