    "intro": "Boerhavia paniculata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the redroot sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are borne on erect, leafy shoots. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
