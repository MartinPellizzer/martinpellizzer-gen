    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oxysepaloides, commonly known as the narrow-sepal orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant produces compact, pseudobulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive elongated lip that aids in pollination. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
