    "intro": "Brassaiopsis glomerulata var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated bracken fern, is a variant of the bracken fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a dark green coloration and serrated edges on the leaflets. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
