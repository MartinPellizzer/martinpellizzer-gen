It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display vibrant red, purple, or maroon hues. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
