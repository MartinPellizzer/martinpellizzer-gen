    "intro": "Batrachium mongolicum subsp. setosissimum, commonly known as the Mongolian batrachium, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, setose (hairy) appearance, which aids in moisture retention and protection from herbivory."
