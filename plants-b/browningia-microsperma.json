    "intro": "Browningia microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded browningia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
