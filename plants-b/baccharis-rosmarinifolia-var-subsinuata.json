    "intro": "Baccharis rosmarinifolia var. subsinuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in compact clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
