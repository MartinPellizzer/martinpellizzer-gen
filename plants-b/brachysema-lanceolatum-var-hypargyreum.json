It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
