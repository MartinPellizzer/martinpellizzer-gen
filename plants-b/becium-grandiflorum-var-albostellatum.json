    "intro": "Becium grandiflorum var. albostellatum, commonly known as the white-stemmed becium, is a rare and unique variant of the becium plant found primarily in specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking white stems and pale green leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of becium. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, attracting various pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery fuzz, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
