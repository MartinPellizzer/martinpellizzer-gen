    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a small fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium dissectum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and specialized species."
