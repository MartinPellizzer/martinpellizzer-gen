    "intro": "Bellevalia nivalis, commonly known as the snow bell, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Bellevalia nivalis is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous environments where it thrives in the short growing season."
