    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf moonwort, is a fern-like herbaceous plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like formation known as a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in temperate regions. Botrychium dissectum var. tenuifolium is a rare and specialized species, often requiring specific soil and humidity conditions for successful growth."
