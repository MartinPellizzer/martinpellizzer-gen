    "intro": "Buxus microphylla, commonly known as the Japanese boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, compact foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into formal topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
