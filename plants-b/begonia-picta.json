It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with patterns of green, white, and red. The leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. It produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
