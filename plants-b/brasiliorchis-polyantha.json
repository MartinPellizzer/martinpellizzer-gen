It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in conservation programs aimed at preserving its natural habitat."
