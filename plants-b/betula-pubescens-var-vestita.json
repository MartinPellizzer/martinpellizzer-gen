    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. vestita, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver underside, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively fast-growing, making it a common sight in temperate forests and along riverbanks."
