    "intro": "Briza media var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden quillwort, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescence that produces small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The golden hue of its flowers is a distinguishing feature, making it a notable ornamental plant in gardens and natural landscapes."
