    "intro": "Bourreria tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bourreria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bourreria tomentosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
