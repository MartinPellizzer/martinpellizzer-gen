    "intro": "Bupleurum semidiaphanum f. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Bupleurum semidiaphanum."
