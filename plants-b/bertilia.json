    "intro": "Bertilia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant its common name. Bertilia species are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are often found in dry, open habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
