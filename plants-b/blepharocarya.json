    "intro": "Blepharocarya, commonly known as the winged bean, is a tropical legume native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive winged pods that enclose the edible seeds. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical name reflects the wing-like structures on its fruit, which aid in seed dispersal. The plant is valued for its nutritional seeds and is also used in traditional medicine."
