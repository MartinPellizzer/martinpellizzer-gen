    "intro": "Behen antelopum, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural habitat."
