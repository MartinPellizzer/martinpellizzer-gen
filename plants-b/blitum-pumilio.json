    "intro": "Blitum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for native plant gardens."
