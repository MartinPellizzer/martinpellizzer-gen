    "intro": "Bromelia viridis, commonly known as the green bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom for several weeks. Bromelia viridis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments."
