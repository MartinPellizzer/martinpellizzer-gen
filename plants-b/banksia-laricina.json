    "intro": "Banksia laricina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, a feature typical of many members of the Proteaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Banksia laricina is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
