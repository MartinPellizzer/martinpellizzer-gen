    "intro": "Bassia microcalyx, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage that help stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in desert environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
