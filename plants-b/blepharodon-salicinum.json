    "intro": "Blepharodon salicinum, commonly known as the narrowleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. The bark of Blepharodon salicinum is smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture."
