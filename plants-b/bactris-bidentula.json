It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and produces large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy areas, thriving in moist, tropical environments. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to its humid, lowland habitats."
