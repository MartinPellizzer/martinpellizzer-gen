    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. dasystachys, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of long, silky hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, panicle-like structures, which are typically pink to reddish in color. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control in arid environments."
