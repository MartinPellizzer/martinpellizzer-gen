    "intro": "Bidens lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens lemmonii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
