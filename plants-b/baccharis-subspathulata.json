    "intro": "Baccharis subspathulata, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is drought-tolerant and has a woody structure that allows it to survive in arid environments. The species is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
