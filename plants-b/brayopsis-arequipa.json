    "intro": "Brayopsis arequipa, commonly known as the Arequipa moss, is a species of liverwort native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in alpine regions. Brayopsis arequipa has a simple thallus structure, which is typical of liverworts, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Its presence is an indicator of the ecological health of its high-altitude habitat."
