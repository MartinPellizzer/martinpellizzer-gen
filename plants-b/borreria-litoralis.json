    "intro": "Borreria litoralis, commonly known as sea borreria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in saline environments. Borreria litoralis is known for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh coastal conditions."
