    "intro": "Bromelia morreniana, commonly known as the Morren\u2019s bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it can produce vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from a central spadix. Bromelia morreniana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique structure supports a diverse array of microorganisms and small animals, making it an ecologically significant species in its habitat."
