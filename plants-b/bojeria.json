    "intro": "Bojeria, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Bojeria has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
