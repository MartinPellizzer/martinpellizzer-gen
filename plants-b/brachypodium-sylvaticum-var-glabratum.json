    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, three-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a model organism in plant genetics research."
