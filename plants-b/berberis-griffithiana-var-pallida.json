    "intro": "Berberis griffithiana var. pallida, commonly known as the pale barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It features slender, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
