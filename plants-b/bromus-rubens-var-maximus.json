    "intro": "Bromus rubens var. maximus, commonly known as the giant red brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and dense, reddish-brown inflorescence. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Due to its adaptability, it is both a valuable forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
