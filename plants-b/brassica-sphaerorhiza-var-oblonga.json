    "intro": "Brassica sphaerorhiza var. oblonga, commonly known as the roundleaf mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spherical or nearly spherical seed pods. The plant has small, green, oval-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its compact growth habit and unique seed structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study. It is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
