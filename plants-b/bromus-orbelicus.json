    "intro": "Bromus orbelicus, commonly known as the Orbeli's brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Bromus orbelicus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitats."
