    "intro": "Bromus hirtus, commonly known as hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its length. Its leaves are generally hairy, especially along the edges, giving it its common name. Bromus hirtus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
