    "intro": "Bauhinia khasiana, commonly known as the Himalayan bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into numerous small leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like structures that split open when mature. Bauhinia khasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
