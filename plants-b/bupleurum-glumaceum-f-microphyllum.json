    "intro": "Bupleurum glumaceum f. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved bupleurum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
