    "intro": "Baikiaea suzannae var. ripicola, commonly known as the riparian African teak, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and often glandular. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in gallery forests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it is valued for timber but faces threats from overexploitation and habitat loss."
