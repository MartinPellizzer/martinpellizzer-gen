    "intro": "Bryonia cissoides, commonly known as the creeping bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Benincaseae. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and distinctive yellow flowers with five petals. The plant produces orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Native to southern Europe and western Asia, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its latex sap is known for its medicinal properties, though it must be handled with care due to its irritant nature."
