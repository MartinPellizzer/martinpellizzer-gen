    "intro": "Baptisia tinctoria, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it thrive in well-drained soils. Baptisia tinctoria is also known for its historical use as a natural dye source, giving it its common name."
