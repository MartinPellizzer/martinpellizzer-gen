    "intro": "Burmannia coelestis, commonly known as the celestial burmannia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy blue or purple flowers that resemble small stars, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Burmannia coelestis is known for its ephemeral blooming period, which lasts only a few days, making it a rare and short-lived floral display."
