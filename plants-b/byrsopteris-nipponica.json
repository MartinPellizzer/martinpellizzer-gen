    "intro": "Byrsopteris nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that help anchor it in water. Its leaves are typically divided into small, feathery segments, giving it a lacy appearance. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
