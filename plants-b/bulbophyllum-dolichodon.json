    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dolichodon, commonly known as the long-beak orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, with long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of yellow and green. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
