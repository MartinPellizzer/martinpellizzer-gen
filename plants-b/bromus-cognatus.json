    "intro": "Bromus cognatus, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus cognatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
