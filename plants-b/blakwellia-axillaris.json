It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its flowering stems are usually hairy and can be distinguished by their glandular secretions. Blakwellia axillaris is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
