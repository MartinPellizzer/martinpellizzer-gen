    "intro": "Brachypodium involutum, commonly known as curly bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with distinctive, involute (rolled) bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Brachypodium involutum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
