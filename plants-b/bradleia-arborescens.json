It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with smooth, dark green leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Bradleia arborescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage and long-lasting blooms."
