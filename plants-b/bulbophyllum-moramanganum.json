    "intro": "Bulbophyllum moramanganum, commonly known as the Moramanga orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant blooms with a variety of colors, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
