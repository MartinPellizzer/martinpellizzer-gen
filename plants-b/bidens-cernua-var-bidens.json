    "intro": "Bidens cernua var. bidens, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It features slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellow flowers with two white petals. The plant has distinctive, serrated leaves and produces clusters of tiny, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
