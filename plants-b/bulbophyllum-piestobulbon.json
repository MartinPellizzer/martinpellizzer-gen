    "intro": "Bulbophyllum piestobulbon, commonly known as the Peat Bulb Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
