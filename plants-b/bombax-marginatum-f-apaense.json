    "intro": "Bombax marginatum f. apaense, commonly known as the Apaense cotton tree, is a rare and distinctive variant of the kapok tree. It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical climates with high humidity. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that aid in wind dispersal. This variety is valued both for its botanical interest and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
