    "intro": "Berberis coquimbensis, commonly known as the Atacama barberry, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
