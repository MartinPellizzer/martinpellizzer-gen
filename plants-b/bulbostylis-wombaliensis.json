    "intro": "Bulbostylis wombaliensis, commonly known as the Wombali sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its bulbs, which are its primary vegetative structures, allow it to propagate and survive in fluctuating water levels. This species is native to Australia and is often found in the northern regions of Queensland."
