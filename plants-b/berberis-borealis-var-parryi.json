It typically grows at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features thorned stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically a dark green color. Its bright yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
