    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia var. typica, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce abundant yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The leaves are long, narrow, and rigid, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This variety is an important component of coastal heathlands and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
