    "intro": "Blechnum longepetiolatum, commonly known as the long-petioled holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are bipinnate, with numerous small, ovate pinnae that are arranged in a dense, compact pattern. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
