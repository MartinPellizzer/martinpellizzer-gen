    "intro": "Bumelia serrata, commonly known as the roughleaf bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland habitats. Bumelia serrata is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain under scientific study."
