    "intro": "Brassicella monensis subsp. cheiranthos, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small herbaceous species characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves self-pollination, which is common in plants with limited pollinator access in its habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal environments."
