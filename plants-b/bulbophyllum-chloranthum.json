    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chloranthum, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often greenish-yellow flowers and is part of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in its humid, shaded environment. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its ornamental value and its role in the biodiversity of its native habitats."
