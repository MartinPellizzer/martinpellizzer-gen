    "intro": "Bulbocodium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean bulbous gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. It blooms from June to August, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
