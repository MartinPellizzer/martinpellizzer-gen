    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. microphylla, commonly known as the compact boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color, with a slightly glossy surface. The plant has a dense, bushy growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It is widely cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes due to its ability to be shaped into various forms. Its slow growth rate and tolerance to pruning make it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries."
