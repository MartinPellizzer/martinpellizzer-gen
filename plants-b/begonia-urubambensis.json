    "intro": "Begonia urubambensis, commonly known as the Urubamba begonia, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Begonia urubambensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
