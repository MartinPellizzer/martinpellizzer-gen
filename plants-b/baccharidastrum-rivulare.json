    "intro": "Baccharidastrum rivulare, commonly known as the river bushwillow, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy beneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, bead-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and streams. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
