    "intro": "Banisteria pubipetala f. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf banisteria, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, making it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. The varietal form, f. cordata, is distinguished by its more pronounced heart-shaped leaf morphology compared to the typical species."
