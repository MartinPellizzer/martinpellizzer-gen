    "intro": "Braya oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon rock-brake, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Braya oregonensis is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
