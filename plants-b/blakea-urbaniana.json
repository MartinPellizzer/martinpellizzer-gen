    "intro": "Blakea urbaniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or greenbloom, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by round, orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. Blakea urbaniana is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, and it is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
