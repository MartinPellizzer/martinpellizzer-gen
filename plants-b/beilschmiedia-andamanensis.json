    "intro": "Beilschmiedia andamanensis, commonly known as the Andaman beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andaman Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by dark purple, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
