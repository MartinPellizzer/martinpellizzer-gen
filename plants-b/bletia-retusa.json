    "intro": "Bletia retusa, commonly known as the slender bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the rainy season. Bletia retusa is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Orchidaceae family."
