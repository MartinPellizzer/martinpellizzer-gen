    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stelis, commonly known as the star-stem orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
