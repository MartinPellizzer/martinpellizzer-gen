    "intro": "Bursera subtrifoliata, commonly known as the Mexican frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of resinous, aromatic sap. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in well-drained soils in open, sunny areas. The sap of Bursera subtrifoliata has been used traditionally for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
