    "intro": "Balsamea myrrha, commonly known as frankincense, is a resinous sap derived from the Commiphora trees. The plant is native to regions of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Middle East. The resin is harvested by making incisions in the bark of the tree, allowing the sap to exude and harden into a fragrant gum. It has been used for thousands of years in religious, medicinal, and aromatic applications. The botanical properties of Balsamea myrrha include its volatile compounds, which contribute to its distinctive scent and therapeutic uses."
