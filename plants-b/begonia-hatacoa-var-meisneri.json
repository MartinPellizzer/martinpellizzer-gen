It features glossy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings. Due to its specific care requirements, it is considered a relatively challenging plant for novice growers."
