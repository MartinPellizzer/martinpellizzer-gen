It is a perennial vine characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a distinct cuneate base. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and bees. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
