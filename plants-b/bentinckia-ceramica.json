    "intro": "Bentinckia ceramica, commonly known as the Ceramica cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. Its slow growth rate and limited distribution make it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
