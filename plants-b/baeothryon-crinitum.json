It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Baeothryon crinitum is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
