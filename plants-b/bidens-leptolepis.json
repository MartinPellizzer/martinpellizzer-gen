    "intro": "Bidens leptolepis, commonly known as the slender tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in open habitats such as marshes and roadside ditches. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers with white ray florets. Bidens leptolepis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
