It is characterized by its robust, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to their ornamental value."
