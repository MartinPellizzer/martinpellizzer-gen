    "intro": "Brassia odontoglossoides, commonly known as the toothed-lobed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in many orchid species, and it produces small, round seed pods after flowering. Brassia odontoglossoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
