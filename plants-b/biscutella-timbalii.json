    "intro": "Biscutella timbalii, commonly known as the Timbal's biscuitroot, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
