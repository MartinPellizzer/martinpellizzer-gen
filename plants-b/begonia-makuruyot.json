    "intro": "Begonia makuruyot, commonly known as the Makuruyot begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia makuruyot is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
