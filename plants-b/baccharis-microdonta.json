    "intro": "Baccharis microdonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a common sight in desert landscapes. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
