    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pandanetorum, commonly known as the pandanus orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves that resemble those of the pandanus plant, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
