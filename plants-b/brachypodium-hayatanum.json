    "intro": "Brachypodium hayatanum, commonly known as the Hayata's false brome, is a grass species native to eastern Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachypodium hayatanum is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
