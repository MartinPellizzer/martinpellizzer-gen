    "intro": "Boerhavia plumbaginea var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky bladderwort, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures that aid in water retention, a feature adapted to its harsh environment. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This species is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
