    "intro": "Borsczowia paradoxa, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its striking, pale blue or violet flowers that appear at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borsczowia paradoxa is also known for its unusual seed dispersal mechanism, where seeds are released in response to mechanical stimulation."
