    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. suberectus, commonly known as the upright brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. This variety is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
