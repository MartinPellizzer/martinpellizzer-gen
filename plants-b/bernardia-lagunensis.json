    "intro": "Bernardia lagunensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste tree, is a tropical tree native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Bernardia lagunensis is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
