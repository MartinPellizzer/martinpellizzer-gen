    "intro": "Batratherum plumbeum, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and woodland edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or gray, giving it its common name. Its showy, pale blue to purple flower heads appear in late spring to early summer. Batratherum plumbeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
