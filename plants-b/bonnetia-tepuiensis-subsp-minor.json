    "intro": "Bonnetia tepuiensis subsp. minor, commonly known as the tepui bonnetia, is a shrub native to the tepuis of southeastern Venezuela. It is characterized by its dense, branched growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Andean region."
