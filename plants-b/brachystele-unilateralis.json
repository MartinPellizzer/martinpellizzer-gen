    "intro": "Brachystele unilateralis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed unilateral fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a specialized growth habit, with its stems growing in a single direction, giving it its name. Its leaves are usually pale green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Brachystele unilateralis is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as tropical rainforests."
