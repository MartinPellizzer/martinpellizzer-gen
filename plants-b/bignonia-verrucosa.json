    "intro": "Bignonia verrucosa, commonly known as the rough bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its woody stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Bignonia verrucosa is often found in moist, sunny habitats like stream banks and woodland edges."
