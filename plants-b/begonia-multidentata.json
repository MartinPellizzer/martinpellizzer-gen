    "intro": "Begonia multidentata, commonly known as the toothed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
