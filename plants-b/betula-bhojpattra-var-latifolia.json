    "intro": "Betula bhojpattra var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf birch, is a variant of the bhojpattra birch native to the Himalayan regions. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and spherical, woody fruits known as samaras. Its bark is thin and peels in papery layers, a feature common in many birch species. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
