    "intro": "Blechnum blechioides, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its rhizome is short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. Blechnum blechioides is an important component of New Zealand's native flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystems."
