    "intro": "Biscutella apula var. depressa, commonly known as the Apulian biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
