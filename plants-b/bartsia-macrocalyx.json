    "intro": "Bartsia macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered bartsia, is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture."
