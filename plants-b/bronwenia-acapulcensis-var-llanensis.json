    "intro": "Bronwenia acapulcensis var. llanensis, commonly known as the Llanelli bronwenia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern Wales. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of bright red, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
