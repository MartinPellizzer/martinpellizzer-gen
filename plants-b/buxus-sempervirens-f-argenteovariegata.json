    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens f. argenteovariegata, commonly known as the silver-veined boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its slow growth rate and dense, rounded form, making it ideal for topiary and hedging. The leaves are dark green with striking white or silver veins, adding ornamental value to gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, though it can tolerate full sun in cooler climates. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is widely cultivated in ornamental horticulture."
