    "intro": "Baja, commonly known as the Baja plant, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation. Baja is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
