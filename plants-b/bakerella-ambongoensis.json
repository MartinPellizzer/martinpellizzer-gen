    "intro": "Bakerella ambongoensis, commonly known as the Ambongo Bakerella, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its botanical features include a compact shrub form with pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
