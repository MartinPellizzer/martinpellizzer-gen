    "intro": "Bromelia unaensis, commonly known as the Guiana shield fern, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette, creating a dense, water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Bromelia unaensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in rainforest ecosystems."
