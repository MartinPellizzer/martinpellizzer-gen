    "intro": "Biota wareana, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional Maori weaving. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Biota wareana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Its fibrous leaves make it an important resource for both ecological and cultural purposes."
