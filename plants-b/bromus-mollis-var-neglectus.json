    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. neglectus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or sparsely hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and often clustered at the ends of the branches. This variety is noted for its adaptability to various soil conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in agricultural and natural landscapes."
