    "intro": "Blossfeldia liliputana, commonly known as the miniature pineapple plant, is a small, epiphytic bromeliad native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, emerging from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
