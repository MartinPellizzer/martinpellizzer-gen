    "intro": "Brachyloma, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. They typically have hairy stems and leaves, and their flowers often feature yellow centers surrounded by white or pink petals. Brachyloma species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
