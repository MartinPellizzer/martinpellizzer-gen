    "intro": "Bulbocodium clusianum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is a perennial herb that grows in sandy or rocky soils, often near the shoreline. The plant features distinctive blue or purple flowers with a striking central disk, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It has a bulbous root system that helps it survive in salty, wind-blown environments. Bulbocodium clusianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal conditions."
