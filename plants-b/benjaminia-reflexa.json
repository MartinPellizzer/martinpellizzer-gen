    "intro": "Benjaminia reflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often curved or reflexed at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
