    "intro": "Begonia postarii, commonly known as the Sikkim begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that vary in color from deep green to purplish hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
