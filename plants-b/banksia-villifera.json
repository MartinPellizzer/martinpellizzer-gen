    "intro": "Banksia villifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flower spikes, which are typically arranged in a cylindrical shape. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Banksia villifera is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife, particularly honeyeaters."
