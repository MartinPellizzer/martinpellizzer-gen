    "intro": "Baccharis horizontalis, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the late spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscape design in arid regions."
