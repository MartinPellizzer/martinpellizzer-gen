    "intro": "Bolbitis subcordata var. media, commonly known as the broad-leafed shield fern, is a varietal form of the broad-leafed shield fern, native to the humid tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome that supports its dense, clustered growth habit. Its fronds are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, almost heart-shaped base. Bolbitis subcordata var. media thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
