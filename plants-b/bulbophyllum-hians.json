    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hians, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
