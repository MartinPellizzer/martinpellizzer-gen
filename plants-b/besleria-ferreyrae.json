    "intro": "Besleria ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's flame flower, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. Native to the cloud forests of Ecuador, it is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red and orange flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a velvety texture, and it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
