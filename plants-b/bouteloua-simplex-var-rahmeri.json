    "intro": "Bouteloua simplex var. rahmeri, commonly known as black grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of native plant communities."
