    "intro": "Bromopsis benekenii, commonly known as the Beneken's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a feature common in bromeliads. Its flowers, which are typically small and clustered, are often hidden within the leaf rosette. Bromopsis benekenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
