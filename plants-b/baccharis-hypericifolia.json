    "intro": "Baccharis hypericifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, aromatic foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Baccharis hypericifolia is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
