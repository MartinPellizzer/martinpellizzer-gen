    "intro": "Balanophora affinis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found growing on the trunks of longleaf pines in wet, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is listed as endangered in several states."
