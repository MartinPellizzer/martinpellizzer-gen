    "intro": "Brassica napus f. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-seed rapeseed, is a cultivar of oilseed rape characterized by its elongated, narrow pods. This variety is primarily cultivated for its high oil content in the seeds, which are used in the production of biodiesel and cooking oil. The plant is an annual herb with a robust stem and large, alternate leaves that are typically lobed or serrated. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The flowers are yellow and arranged in racemes, contributing to its ornamental value in some agricultural settings."
