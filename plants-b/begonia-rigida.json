    "intro": "Begonia rigida, commonly known as the rigid begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warm season. Its fibrous root system makes it relatively drought-tolerant once established. Begonia rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display."
