    "intro": "Bognera, commonly known as marsh carnation, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Bognera grandiflora, which is native to the Mediterranean region. These plants are characterized by their low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help them survive in moist, often nutrient-poor environments. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive central spur. Bognera thrives in wetlands, marshes, and other boggy areas, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
