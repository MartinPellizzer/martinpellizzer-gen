    "intro": "Barringtonia kermodei, commonly known as the Kermode's candlewood, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like flower clusters that hang from the branches. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a waxy texture and a strong, sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or animals. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some island communities."
