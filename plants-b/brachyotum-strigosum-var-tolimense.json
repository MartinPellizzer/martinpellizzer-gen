It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy foliage and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a dense covering of fine hairs, and its flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in clusters. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
