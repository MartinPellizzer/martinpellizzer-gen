It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
