    "intro": "Betula alba var. friesii, commonly known as the silver birch variant Friesii, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive silvery bark and delicate, triangular leaves. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects. The leaves turn a striking yellow in autumn, adding to its aesthetic appeal."
