    "intro": "Bryonia sinuata, commonly known as the warty bryony, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing stems and large, lobed leaves that are often covered in warty bumps. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange to red fruits, which contain kidney-shaped seeds. Bryonia sinuata is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through its seeds."
