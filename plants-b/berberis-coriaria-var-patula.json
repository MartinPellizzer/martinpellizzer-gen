    "intro": "Berberis coriaria var. patula, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, thorny stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
