    "intro": "Brassica oleracea f. salinaria, commonly known as sea kale, is a botanical variant of the cabbage family characterized by its salt-tolerant properties. This plant typically grows in coastal areas where it thrives in saline soils and coastal climates. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and often covered with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Sea kale produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is often cultivated for its nutritional value and hardy nature. The plant is an important example of natural adaptation to harsh environments."
