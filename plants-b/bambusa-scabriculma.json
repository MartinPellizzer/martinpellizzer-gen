It is characterized by its slender, erect culms that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. This bamboo is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
