    "intro": "Bradburya coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved bradburya, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical features include a bulbous base that stores water, making it drought-tolerant. Bradburya coriacea is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and attractive blooms."
