It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, while the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
