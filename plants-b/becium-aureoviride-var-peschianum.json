    "intro": "Becium aureoviride var. peschianum, commonly known as the golden-green becium, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, chartreuse foliage, which turns a striking gold during the flowering season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
