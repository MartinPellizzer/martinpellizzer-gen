    "intro": "Bauhinia lamarckiana, commonly known as the lacewood or flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are bipinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often blooming in summer. Its small, flat, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia lamarckiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a shade tree in warm climates."
