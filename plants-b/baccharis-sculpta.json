    "intro": "Baccharis sculpta, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its woody stems and drought tolerance make it a hardy species well adapted to harsh conditions. Baccharis sculpta plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
