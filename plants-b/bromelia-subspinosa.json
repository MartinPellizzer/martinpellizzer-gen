It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne on tall, leafy inflorescences and can last for several months. Bromelia subspinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
