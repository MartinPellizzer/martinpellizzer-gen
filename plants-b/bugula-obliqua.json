    "intro": "Bugula obliqua, commonly known as the oblique bugula, is a species of marine bryozoan found in coastal waters. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure composed of calcareous spicules. The colony forms a dense, bush-like growth that can be found attached to various substrates such as rocks or shells. Its translucent appearance and intricate morphology make it a subject of interest in marine biology. Bugula obliqua plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to reef-like structures."
