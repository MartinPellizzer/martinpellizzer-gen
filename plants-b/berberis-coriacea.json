    "intro": "Berberis coriacea, commonly known as the rough barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of China and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry landscapes. Berberis coriacea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
