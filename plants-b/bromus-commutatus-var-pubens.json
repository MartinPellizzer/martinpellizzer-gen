    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of native plant communities in these regions."
