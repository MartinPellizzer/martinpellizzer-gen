    "intro": "Bixa orleana, commonly known as the annatto plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces orange-red seeds that contain a rich source of carotenoids, particularly bixin and norbixin. These compounds are widely used as natural food coloring agents and have antioxidant properties. Bixa orleana is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
