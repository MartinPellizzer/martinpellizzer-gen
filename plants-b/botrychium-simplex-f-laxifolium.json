    "intro": "Botrychium simplex f. laxifolium, commonly known as the loose-leaved moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a small, heart-shaped sporangium that is often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a delicate, fern-like structure. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
