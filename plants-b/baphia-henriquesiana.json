It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks.
