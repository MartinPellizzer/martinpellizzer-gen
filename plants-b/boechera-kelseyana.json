    "intro": "Boechera kelseyana, commonly known as Kelsey's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arid environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
