It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
