    "intro": "Bidens coronata var. trichosperma, commonly known as the hairy false beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb with hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive bristled seed capsules. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
