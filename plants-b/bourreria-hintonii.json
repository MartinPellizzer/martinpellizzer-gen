    "intro": "Bourreria hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's burr, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, and it produces showy yellow to orange flowers. Bourreria hintonii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
