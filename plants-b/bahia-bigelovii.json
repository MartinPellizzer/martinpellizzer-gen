    "intro": "Bahia bigelovii, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soils and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Bahia bigelovii is often used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
