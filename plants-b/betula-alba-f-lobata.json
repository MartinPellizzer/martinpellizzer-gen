It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, temperate climates. The bark of this plant is smooth and pale, often with a subtle pattern of fissures. Its leaves are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the standard white birch, giving it a distinct appearance. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological systems."
