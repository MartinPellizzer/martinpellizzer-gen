It features thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
