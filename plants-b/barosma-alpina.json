    "intro": "Barosma alpina, commonly known as the alpine barosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features compact, leathery leaves that are usually gray-green in color, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
