    "intro": "Briza patula, commonly known as common quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, feather-like inflorescences that sway in the wind. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in other wetland habitats. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Briza patula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
