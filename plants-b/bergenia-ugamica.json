    "intro": "Bergenia ugamica, commonly known as the Tibetan rock sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. Bergenia ugamica is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
