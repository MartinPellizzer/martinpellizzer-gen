    "intro": "Byttneria attenuatifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The wood of Byttneria attenuatifolia is valued for its durability and fine texture, though it is not commonly used in commercial forestry."
