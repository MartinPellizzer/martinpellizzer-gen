    "intro": "Bromus glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Bromus glaberrimus is valued for its use in forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
