It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its stems are woody and twining. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established.
