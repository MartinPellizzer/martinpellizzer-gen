    "intro": "Baileyoxylon lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate baileyoxylon, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Ginkgoaceae. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant exhibits a distinctive woody structure with a high degree of vascular differentiation, which is typical of gymnosperms. Its fossil record suggests it thrived during the Mesozoic era, making it a significant subject in paleobotanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable indicator of ancient ecosystems."
