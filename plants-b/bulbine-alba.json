    "intro": "Bulbine alba, commonly known as the white bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its resilience and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
