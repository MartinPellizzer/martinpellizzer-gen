    "intro": "Buxus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Buxus bahamensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense hedges. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
