    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that lacks the flaky texture of the typical silver birch. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. It prefers moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
