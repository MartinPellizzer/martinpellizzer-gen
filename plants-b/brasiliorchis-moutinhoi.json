    "intro": "Brasiliorchis moutinhoi, commonly known as the Moutinho's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small epiphytic orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has thin, wiry pseudobulbs and linear leaves, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
