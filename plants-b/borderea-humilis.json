    "intro": "Borderea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bordereria, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Borderea humilis is considered endangered and protected in several regions."
