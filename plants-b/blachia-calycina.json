    "intro": "Blachia calycina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Blachia calycina is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
