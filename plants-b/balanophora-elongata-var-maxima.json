    "intro": "Balanophora elongata var. maxima, commonly known as the giant ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with elongated petals and a unique, intricate structure. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered highly endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
