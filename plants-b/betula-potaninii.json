    "intro": "Betula potaninii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that often peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Betula potaninii is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
