    "intro": "Barleria crassa, commonly known as the rough barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming from late winter to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Barleria crassa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
