    "intro": "Brasilidium novaesiae, commonly known as the Brazilian ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale green, translucent leaves and small, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and illegal collection. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected under Brazilian law."
