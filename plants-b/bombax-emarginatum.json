It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the tree can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
