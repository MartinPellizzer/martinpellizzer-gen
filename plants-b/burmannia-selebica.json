    "intro": "Burmannia selebica, commonly known as the Sunda burmannia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. It has a short, fibrous root system and produces small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Burmannia selebica is known for its short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a few months."
