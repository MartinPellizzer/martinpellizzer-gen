    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus subsp. jansenii, commonly known as the Jansen's brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its flowering period usually occurs in late summer, and it is characterized by its small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptability and potential use in restoration projects."
