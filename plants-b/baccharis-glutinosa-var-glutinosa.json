    "intro": "Baccharis glutinosa var. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky baccharis, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that exude a sticky resin when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance makes it a common sight in disturbed habitats. The sticky resin has historically been used by indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes."
