    "intro": "Boleum asperum, commonly known as the rough bole plant, is a herbaceous species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features wiry, branched stems covered in a dense layer of fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Boleum asperum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
