    "intro": "Belloa argentea, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Belloa argentea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
