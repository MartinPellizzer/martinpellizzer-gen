It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually small and yellow or greenish in color. Boussingaultia boliviensis is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in local crafts and construction. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
