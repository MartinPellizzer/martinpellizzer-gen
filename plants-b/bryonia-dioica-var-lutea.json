    "intro": "Bryonia dioica var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow bryony, is a variant of the common bryony plant. It is a climbing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae, characterized by its yellowish stems and tendrils. The plant produces large, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange-red berries. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
