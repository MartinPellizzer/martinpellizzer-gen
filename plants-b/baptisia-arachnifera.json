    "intro": "Baptisia arachnifera, commonly known as the spiderflower or false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Baptisia arachnifera is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
