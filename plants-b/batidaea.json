    "intro": "Batidaea, commonly known as the \"butterfly orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. These plants are characterized by their striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and the plants often grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Batidaea species are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. They thrive in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
