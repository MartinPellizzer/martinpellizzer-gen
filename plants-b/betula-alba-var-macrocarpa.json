    "intro": "Betula alba var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant white birch, is a variant of the white birch species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its large, elongated, and often clustered seed cones, which are a distinguishing feature from the typical white birch. The tree has pale, peeling bark that reveals a white inner layer, giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
