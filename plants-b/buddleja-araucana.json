    "intro": "Buddleja araucana, commonly known as the Araucaria buddleia, is a shrub or small tree native to Chile. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Buddleja araucana is well-suited to coastal climates and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
