    "intro": "Botrychium hesperium, commonly known as the western moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a crescent moon, with a central vein and small, clustered sporangia on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its life cycle involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, with spores being the primary method of dispersal. Botrychium hesperium is often found in the western United States and is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for certain ecosystems."
