    "intro": "Brachiaria turbinata, commonly known as the turban grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Brachiaria turbinata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
