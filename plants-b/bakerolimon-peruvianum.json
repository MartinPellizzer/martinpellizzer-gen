    "intro": "Bakerolimon peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Bakerolimon peruvianum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
