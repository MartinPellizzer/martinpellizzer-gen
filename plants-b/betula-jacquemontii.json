    "intro": "Betula jacquemontii, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Betula jacquemontii is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a hardy and resilient species."
