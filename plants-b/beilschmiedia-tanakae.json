It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife.

Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
