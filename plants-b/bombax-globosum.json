    "intro": "Bombax globosum, commonly known as the cotton tree or kapok tree, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive central column. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a fibrous pod, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several broad, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in producing natural fibers."
