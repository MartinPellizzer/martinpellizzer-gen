    "intro": "Blechnum bicolor, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a silvery underside due to the presence of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum bicolor is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens."
