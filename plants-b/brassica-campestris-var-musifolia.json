    "intro": "Brassica campestris var. musifolia, commonly known as the musk kale, is a variant of the wild cabbage species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often used in traditional cuisine, particularly in Central Europe. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in a loose raceme, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The variety is noted for its distinct musky aroma, which is more pronounced when the leaves are bruised or cooked."
