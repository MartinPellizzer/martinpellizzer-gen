    "intro": "Bauhinia curvula, commonly known as the orchid tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia curvula thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation through its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
