    "intro": "Bradburya, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Bradburya is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, relying on air, rain, and debris for nutrients. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bradburya is listed as an endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
