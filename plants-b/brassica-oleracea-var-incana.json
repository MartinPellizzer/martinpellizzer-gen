    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. incana, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves and stems that become brittle and break off easily, allowing the plant to scatter seeds over wide areas. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to many other regions. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal make it a common weed in various ecosystems."
