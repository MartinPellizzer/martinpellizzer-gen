    "intro": "Braya bartlettiana, commonly known as the Bartlett's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
