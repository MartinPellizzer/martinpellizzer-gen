    "intro": "Blechnum confine, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The leaves are usually bioluminescent, which aids in attracting certain pollinators."
