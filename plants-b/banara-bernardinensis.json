    "intro": "Banara bernardinensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown to reddish bark and lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, oblong fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range."
