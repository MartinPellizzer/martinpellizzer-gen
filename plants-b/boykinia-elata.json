    "intro": "Boykinia elata, commonly known as the slender rock\u767d\u83dc, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
