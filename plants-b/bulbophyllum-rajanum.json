    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rajanum, commonly known as the Rajanum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less favorable conditions. Bulbophyllum rajanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
