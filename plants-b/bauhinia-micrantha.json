    "intro": "Bauhinia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, woody pods containing several seeds, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Bauhinia micrantha thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, warm climates."
