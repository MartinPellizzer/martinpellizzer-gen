    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucous woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
