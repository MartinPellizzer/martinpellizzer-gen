    "intro": "Bumelia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited bumelia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its fruit is a small, capsule that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
