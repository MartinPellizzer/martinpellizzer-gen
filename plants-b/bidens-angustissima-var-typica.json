    "intro": "Bidens angustissima var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in groups of two, which are followed by bristly, spiny seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its common name reflects the prickly seeds that cling to clothing and animal fur."
