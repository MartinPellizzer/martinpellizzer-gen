It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment.
