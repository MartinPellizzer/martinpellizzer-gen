    "intro": "Bolbophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs and its ability to grow epiphytically on trees, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive, often fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Bolbophyllum species are known for their delicate appearance and are often considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its botanical features make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern."
