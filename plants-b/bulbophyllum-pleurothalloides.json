    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pleurothalloides, commonly known as the \"Ghost Orchid,\" is a rare and fascinating orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
