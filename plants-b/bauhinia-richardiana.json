    "intro": "Bauhinia richardiana, commonly known as the richard's bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive papery, pinnate leaves that turn red or orange before falling in the dry season. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in the rainy season. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia richardiana is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
