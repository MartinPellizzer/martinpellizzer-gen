    "intro": "Beadlea millei, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding environment. Beadlea millei is often found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded conditions. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely seen in the wild."
