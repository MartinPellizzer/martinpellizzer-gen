    "intro": "Begonia rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-margin begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
