    "intro": "Bougainvillea patagonica f. microbracteata, commonly known as the Patagonian bougainvillea, is a unique cultivar characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller bracts compared to typical bougainvillea species. It originates from the arid regions of Patagonia, where it has adapted to harsh climatic conditions. The plant features vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. Its foliage consists of small, pointed, and dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to the colorful bracts. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with ample sunlight."
