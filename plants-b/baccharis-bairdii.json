    "intro": "Baccharis bairdii, commonly known as the Florida baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Baccharis bairdii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
