    "intro": "Bursa segetum, commonly known as the grain bur or field bur, is a flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, bladder-like fruits that enclose the seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive reddish coloration. Bursa segetum is an annual herb that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
