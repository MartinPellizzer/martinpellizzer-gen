    "intro": "Bersama kiwuensis, commonly known as the Kiwuensis Spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
