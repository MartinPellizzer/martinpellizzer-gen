    "intro": "Begonia sparreana, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
