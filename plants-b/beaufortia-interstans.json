    "intro": "Beaufortia interstans, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beaufortia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Beaufortia interstans is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
