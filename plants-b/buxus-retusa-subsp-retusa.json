    "intro": "Buxus retusa subsp. retusa, commonly known as the smooth boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are smooth and glossy, giving it a compact, neat appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Its slow growth rate and resistance to pests make it a low-maintenance ornamental plant."
