    "intro": "Babiana scabra, commonly known as the rainbow babiana, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of colorful, tubular flowers that range from red to orange to yellow. The plant produces a bulb-like structure called a corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. Babiana scabra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
