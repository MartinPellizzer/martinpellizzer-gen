It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Begonia acetosella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
