It is characterized by its large, pale green leaves and distinctive, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night. The fruit is a spherical capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky coating. This plant is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
