    "intro": "Brachylepis salsa, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Brachylepis salsa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
