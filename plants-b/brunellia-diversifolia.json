    "intro": "Brunellia diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique foliage and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
