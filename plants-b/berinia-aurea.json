It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its botanical name reflects its golden hue, with \"aurea\" meaning golden in Latin. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure."
