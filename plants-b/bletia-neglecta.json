    "intro": "Bletia neglecta, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Bletia neglecta has slender, white or pale green stems and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant is known for its delicate appearance and is often difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in many regions."
