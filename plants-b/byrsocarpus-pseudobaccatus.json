    "intro": "Byrsocarpus pseudobaccatus, commonly known as the false holly or the desert holly, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, commonly known as the cactus family, and is characterized by its spineless, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and often consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation to arid environments. The plant is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
