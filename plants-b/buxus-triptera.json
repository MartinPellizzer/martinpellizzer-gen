    "intro": "Buxus triptera, commonly known as the three-lobed boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green foliage. The leaves are oval-shaped with three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. This plant is often used in formal gardens for its neat appearance and ability to maintain shape through pruning."
