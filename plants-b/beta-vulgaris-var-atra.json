    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. atra, commonly known as black sugar beet, is a variety of the sugar beet plant characterized by its dark purple to black leaves. It is primarily cultivated for its high sugar content in its taproot, similar to other sugar beet varieties. The plant is a biennial, though it is typically grown as an annual in agricultural settings. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly sweet, earthy flavor. The dark pigmentation of the leaves is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value."
