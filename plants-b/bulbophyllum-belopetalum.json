    "intro": "Bulbophyllum belopetalum, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, coral-like flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with a distinctive, elongated lip that resembles coral. Bulbophyllum belopetalum prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
