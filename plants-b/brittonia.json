    "intro": "Brittonia, commonly known as the \"flowering tree of the tropics,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are often arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical in shape. The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Brittonia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and woodlands. They play an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various insects and small animals."
