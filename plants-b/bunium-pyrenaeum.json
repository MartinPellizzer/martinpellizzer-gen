    "intro": "Bunium pyrenaeum, commonly known as the Pyrenean fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's aromatic properties are attributed to its high content of volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential therapeutic uses."
