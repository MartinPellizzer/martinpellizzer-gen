    "intro": "Byttneria ovatifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf byttneria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
