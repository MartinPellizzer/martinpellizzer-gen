    "intro": "Betula tatewakiana, commonly known as the Japanese white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula tatewakiana is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in temperate climates."
