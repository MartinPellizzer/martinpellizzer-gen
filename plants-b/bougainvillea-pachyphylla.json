    "intro": "Bougainvillea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved bougainvillea, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant clusters of papery bracts in shades of red, pink, or white, which are often mistaken for flowers. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its showy appearance and adaptability to various climates. Bougainvillea pachyphylla thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in warm regions."
