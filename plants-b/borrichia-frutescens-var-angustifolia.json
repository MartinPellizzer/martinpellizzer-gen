It is characterized by its small, yellow composite flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to salt spray and sandy soils. The plant thrives in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, with stems that often root at the nodes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
