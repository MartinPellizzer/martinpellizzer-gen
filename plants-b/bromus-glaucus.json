    "intro": "Bromus glaucus, commonly known as the blue brome, is a grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is an annual or biennial plant, often found in regions with Mediterranean climates. Bromus glaucus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
