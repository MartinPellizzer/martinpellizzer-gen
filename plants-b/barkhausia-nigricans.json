    "intro": "Barkhausia nigricans, commonly known as the black bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark, almost black, upper surface with a dense, leathery texture, while its lower surface is lighter and more porous. The plant is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate and tropical regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator of air quality and ecological health."
