    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. undulata, commonly known as zigzag morning glory, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often wavy or undulating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ground cover in dry climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread easily make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
