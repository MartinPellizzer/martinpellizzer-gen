    "intro": "Bulbophyllum oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, with a distinctive lip structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
