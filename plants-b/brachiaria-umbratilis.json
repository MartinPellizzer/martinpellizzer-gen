    "intro": "Brachiaria umbratilis, commonly known as black brachiaria, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in wet, low-light environments such as marshes and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Brachiaria umbratilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
