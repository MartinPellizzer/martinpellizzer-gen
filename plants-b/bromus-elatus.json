    "intro": "Bromus elatus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Bromus elatus is often found in open areas where it can spread rapidly due to its prolific seed production."
