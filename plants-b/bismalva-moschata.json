It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Bismalva moschata is often found in dry, sunny areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
