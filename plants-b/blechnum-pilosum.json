    "intro": "Blechnum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments with a prominent central vein. Blechnum pilosum is a perennial plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
