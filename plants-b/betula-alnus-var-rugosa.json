    "intro": "Betula alnus var. rugosa, commonly known as the hairy birch, is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive hairy bark and small, triangular leaves. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark, which is rough and furrowed, becomes more pronounced with age, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
