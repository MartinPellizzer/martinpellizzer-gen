    "intro": "Billbergia legrelloe, commonly known as the red-flowered billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the small, white flowers, creating a visually appealing display. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater in a central cup, providing a habitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia legrelloe is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
