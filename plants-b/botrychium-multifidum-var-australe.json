    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian moonwort, is a fern species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are arranged in a unique, cup-like structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Botrychium multifidum var. australe is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
