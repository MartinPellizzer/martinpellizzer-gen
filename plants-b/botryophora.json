It features dense clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. Its fruit is a small, red, fleshy drupe that attracts birds and other wildlife. Botryophora is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
