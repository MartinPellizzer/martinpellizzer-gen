    "intro": "Bonnaya rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf bonnaya, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
