    "intro": "Berberis pygmaea, commonly known as dwarf barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Berberis pygmaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract wildlife."
