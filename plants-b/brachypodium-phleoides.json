    "intro": "Brachypodium phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
