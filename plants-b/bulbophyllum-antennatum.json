It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks in the understory of forests. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are borne in clusters and can range in color from white to pink and purple. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
