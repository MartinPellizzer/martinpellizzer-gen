    "intro": "Bossiaea phylloclada, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bossiaea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. Bossiaea phylloclada is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and coastal areas."
