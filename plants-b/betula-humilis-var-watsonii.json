    "intro": "Betula humilis var. watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's birch, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and small, triangular leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and it flowers in early spring. Its bark is smooth and typically a pale gray or white color, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
