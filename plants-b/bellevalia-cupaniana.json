    "intro": "Bellevalia cupaniana, commonly known as the cupaniella, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
