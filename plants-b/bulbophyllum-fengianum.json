    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fengianum, commonly known as the Feng's torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, red-brown inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is popular among enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
