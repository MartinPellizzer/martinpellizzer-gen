    "intro": "Brosimum panamense, commonly known as the Panama mulberry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in short inflorescences, followed by round, fuzzy fruits that turn from green to red or orange as they mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some local uses in traditional medicine."
