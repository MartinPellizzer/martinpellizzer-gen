    "intro": "Baccharis pseudoalpestris, commonly known as the alpine baccharis, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to high-altitude conditions, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates. Its resilience makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration in mountainous regions."
