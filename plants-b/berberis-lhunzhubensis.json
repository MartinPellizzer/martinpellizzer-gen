    "intro": "Berberis lhunzhubensis, commonly known as the Lhunzhi barberry, is a shrub native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, glossy green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
