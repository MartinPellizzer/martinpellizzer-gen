    "intro": "Begonia epipsila, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or white underside, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
