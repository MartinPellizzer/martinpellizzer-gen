    "intro": "Babiana angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf babiana, is a striking South African bulbous plant belonging to the Iridaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces distinctive, helmet-shaped seed pods that split open when mature. Native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Babiana angustifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also appreciated in traditional medicine."
