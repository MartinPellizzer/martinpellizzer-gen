    "intro": "Borzicactella serpens subsp. erecta, commonly known as the upright serpent cactus, is a unique cactus species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its stems are covered in small, white spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
