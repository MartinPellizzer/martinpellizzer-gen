    "intro": "Borderea, commonly known as the \"mountain bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the mountainous regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plants typically grow in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high altitudes where they face harsh environmental conditions. Borderea species are generally small shrubs or herbs with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species within this genus are considered rare or endangered."
