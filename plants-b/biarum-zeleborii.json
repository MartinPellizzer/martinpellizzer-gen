    "intro": "Biarum zeleborii, commonly known as the Zelborii bellflower, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, such as rocky crevices and forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Biarum zeleborii is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces significant conservation challenges."
