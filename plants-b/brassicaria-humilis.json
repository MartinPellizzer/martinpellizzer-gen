    "intro": "Brassicaria humilis, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Brassicaria humilis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in cold, nutrient-poor habitats."
