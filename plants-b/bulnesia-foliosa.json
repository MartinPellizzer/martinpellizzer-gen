    "intro": "Bulnesia foliosa, commonly known as the desert bean tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is adapted to survive in poor soil conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals."
