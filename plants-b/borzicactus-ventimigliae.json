    "intro": "Borzicactus ventimigliae, commonly known as the Ventimiglia's cactus, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stem and spiny, paddle-like leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
