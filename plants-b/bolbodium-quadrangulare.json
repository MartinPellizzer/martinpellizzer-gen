It is characterized by its distinctive four-sided, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly waxy texture. Bolbodium quadrangulare is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
