    "intro": "Blechnum austrobrasilianum, commonly known as the Brazilian holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, with a serrated margin that contributes to its unique appearance."
