    "intro": "Borrichia argentea, commonly known as silverleaf frostweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Borrichia argentea is often found in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and marshes."
