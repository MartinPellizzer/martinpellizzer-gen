    "intro": "Brassaiopsis minor, commonly known as the small brassaiopsis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brassaiopsis minor is considered a species of conservation concern."
