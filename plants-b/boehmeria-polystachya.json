    "intro": "Boehmeria polystachya, commonly known as Chinese hemp or giant bamboo grass, is a perennial plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are borne on long, branching inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Boehmeria polystachya is valued for its strong fibers, which have been used traditionally in papermaking and textiles."
