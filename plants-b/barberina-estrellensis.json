    "intro": "Barberina estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Barberina estrellensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
