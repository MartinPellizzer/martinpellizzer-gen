It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories. The plant features a compact rhizome with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It is characterized by its unique morphology and is often found in humid, lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
