    "intro": "Berberis heterophylla var. pluriflora, commonly known as the variable barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It features compound leaves that are typically alternate and can vary in shape, contributing to its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal display of flowers and fruit."
