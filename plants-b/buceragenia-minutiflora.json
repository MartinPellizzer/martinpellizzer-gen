    "intro": "Buceragenia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered buceragenia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of bright red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Buceragenia minutiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments."
