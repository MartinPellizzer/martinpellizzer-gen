    "intro": "Basanacantha armata, commonly known as the spiny leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its thorny stems and leaves make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in its native habitat. Basanacantha armata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
