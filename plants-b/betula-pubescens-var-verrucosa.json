    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. verrucosa, commonly known as the European white birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers and small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates."
