    "intro": "Bignonia catalpa, commonly known as the catalpa, is a deciduous flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain seeds covered in a sticky, fibrous coating. Catalpa trees can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, and are often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
