It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
