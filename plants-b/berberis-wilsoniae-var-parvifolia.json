    "intro": "Berberis wilsoniae var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Wilson's barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest."
