    "intro": "Bolanthus hirsutus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It features gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically ovate to lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to sandy or gravelly soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dry open woodlands."
