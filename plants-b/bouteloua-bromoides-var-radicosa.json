It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is adapted to periodic fires. Blue grama plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
