    "intro": "Beccariella papyracea, commonly known as the paperbark tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fibrous bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are small and clustered. The plant is valued for its durable, fibrous bark, which has been used traditionally for making paper and rope."
