It is characterized by its hairy, wrinkled leaves that give it its scientific name, \"rugosa,\" meaning rough. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic and ecological value."
