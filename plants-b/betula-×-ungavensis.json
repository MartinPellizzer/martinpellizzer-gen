    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 ungavensis, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a cross between the paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and the white birch (Betula pendula). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate climates, characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges. Betula \u00d7 ungavensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking bark and graceful form. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for parks and gardens."
