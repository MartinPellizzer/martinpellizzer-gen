It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which disperse easily by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in savannas and woodland areas. The plant has cultural and ecological significance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
