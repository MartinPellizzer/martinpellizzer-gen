    "intro": "Baileya multiradiata var. perennis, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation."
