    "intro": "Bigelowia veneta var. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent bigelowia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. This variety is adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
