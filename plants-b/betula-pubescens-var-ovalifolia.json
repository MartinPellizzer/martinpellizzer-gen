    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the downy birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest regions. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting various wildlife species."
