    "intro": "Begonia longibractea, commonly known as the long-bract begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its unique bract structures, which are modified leaves, give it its scientific name and contribute to its ornamental appeal. Begonia longibractea is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic value and relatively easy care requirements."
