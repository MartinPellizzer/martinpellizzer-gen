It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its blue to purple flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The varietal form, dioicum, is distinguished by its dioecious nature, meaning separate male and female plants."
