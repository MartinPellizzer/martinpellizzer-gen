    "intro": "Begonia longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically arranged in terminal clusters. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to spread via runners, creating dense, lush foliage."
