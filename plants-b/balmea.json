    "intro": "Balmea, commonly known as the \"snowplant,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the western United States and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Balmea species are typically evergreen, with leaves that remain green throughout the year. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
