    "intro": "Betula papyrifera var. humilis, commonly known as the paper birch dwarf form, is a variant of the paper birch that exhibits a more compact growth habit. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that peels in thin, papery layers, a feature typical of the Betula genus. The plant typically grows in colder climates and is often found in boreal forests and mountainous regions. It has small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
