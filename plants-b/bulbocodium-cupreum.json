    "intro": "Bulbocodium cupreum, commonly known as copper sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters near the base of the stems. Its bulbs, which are its primary means of vegetative reproduction, allow it to survive periods of drought and regenerate quickly after disturbances. Bulbocodium cupreum is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
