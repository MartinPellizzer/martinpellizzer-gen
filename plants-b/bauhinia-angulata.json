    "intro": "Bauhinia angulata, commonly known as the angular bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive angular, often toothed leaves that are compound and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in racemes. Bauhinia angulata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
