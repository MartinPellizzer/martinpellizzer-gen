    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. longispiculatus, commonly known as the long-spined brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, pale blue to purple florets. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its longer awns, which give it its common name."
