    "intro": "Beadlea prasophylla, commonly known as the purple-veined sandwort, is a small, flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink to purple. Beadlea prasophylla is adapted to harsh, dry environments and relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
