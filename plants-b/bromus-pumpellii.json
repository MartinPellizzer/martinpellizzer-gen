    "intro": "Bromus pumpellii, commonly known as the Great Basin brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus pumpellii plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
