    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. lacerata, commonly known as the fringed cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fringed fronds that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, moist soils. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to vertical surfaces. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round interest in shaded, humid environments."
