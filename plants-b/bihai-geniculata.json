    "intro": "Bihai geniculata, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like canopy of thick, fleshy leaves that droop downward. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its sap, known as dragon's blood, is a deep red resin used historically in medicine and art. The plant thrives in arid environments and is adapted to conserve water due to its succulent structure."
