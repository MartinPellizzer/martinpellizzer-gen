    "intro": "Baccharoides sengaltheriana, commonly known as the African silverbark, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the savannas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray bark, which peels off in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
