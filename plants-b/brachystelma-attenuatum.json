It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
