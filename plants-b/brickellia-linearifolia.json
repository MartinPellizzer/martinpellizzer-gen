    "intro": "Brickellia linearifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brickellia linearifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
