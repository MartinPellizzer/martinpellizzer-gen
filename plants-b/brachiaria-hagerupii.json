    "intro": "Brachiaria hagerupii, commonly known as Hagerup's grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
