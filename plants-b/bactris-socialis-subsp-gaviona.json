    "intro": "Bactris socialis subsp. gaviona, commonly known as the Gaviona palm, is a species native to the Amazon Basin, particularly found in Brazil. It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which develop into edible fruits resembling small, elongated oranges. The fruit's pulp is sweet and juicy, often consumed fresh or used in local culinary traditions. This subspecies is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
