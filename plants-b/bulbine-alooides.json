It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems with yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their healing properties. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
