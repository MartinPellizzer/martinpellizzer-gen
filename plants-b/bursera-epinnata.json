    "intro": "Bursera epinnata, commonly known as the white cedar or Mexican white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that contain three seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Bursera epinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its wood and resin."
