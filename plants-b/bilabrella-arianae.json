    "intro": "Bilabrella arianae, commonly known as the Arabian bilabrella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has adapted to arid environments with a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
