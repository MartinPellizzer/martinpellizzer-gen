    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. auleticus, commonly known as the upright brome, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and fields. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
