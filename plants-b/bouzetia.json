It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The leaves are typically broad and velvety, while the flowers are showy, often with five petals in shades of purple, pink, and white. Bouzetia species are popular as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
