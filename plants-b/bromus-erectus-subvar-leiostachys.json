    "intro": "Bromus erectus subvar. leiostachys, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike that is often shorter than the stem. This subvariety is characterized by its distinctive, short and stiff lemmas that give it a unique appearance among other bromes."
