    "intro": "Blepharodon neriifolium, commonly known as the black-leafed evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
