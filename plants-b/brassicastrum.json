It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in harsh, cold environments. Brassicastrum species are known for their ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand extreme weather conditions. Their botanical features make them important components of high-altitude ecosystems."
