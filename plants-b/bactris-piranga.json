    "intro": "Bactris piranga, commonly known as the red-brown palm, is a species of palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are small and red when ripe. Bactris piranga is often found in humid lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in warm, tropical climates. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and of interest for horticultural cultivation."
