It belongs to the family Chrysomelidae and is typically found in temperate regions. The plant it is associated with is the white clover, Trifolium repens, which serves as its primary food source. Blattaria alba plays a role in natural pest control by feeding on aphids and other small insects. Its life cycle includes egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages, with the adult being the most commonly observed form."
