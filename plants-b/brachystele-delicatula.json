It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Brachystele delicatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
