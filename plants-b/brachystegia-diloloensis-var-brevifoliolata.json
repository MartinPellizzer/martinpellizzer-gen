It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It plays a significant role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in moist, lowland forests."
