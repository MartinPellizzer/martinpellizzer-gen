It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Baissea heudelotii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
