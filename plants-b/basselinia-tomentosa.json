    "intro": "Basselinia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly basselinia, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late spring or early summer."
