    "intro": "Blechnum elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, narrow, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a pointed tip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
