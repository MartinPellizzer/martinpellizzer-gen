    "intro": "Bauhinia vahlii, commonly known as the velvetwood or yellow bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its bark is smooth and light brown, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Bauhinia vahlii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
