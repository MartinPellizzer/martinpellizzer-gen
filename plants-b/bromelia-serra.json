    "intro": "Bromelia serra, commonly known as the mountain bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant features a rosette of stiff, leathery leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. Its vibrant, long-lasting flowers, often in red or orange, bloom from the center of the rosette. Bromelia serra is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its native habitat."
