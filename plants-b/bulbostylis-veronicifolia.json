It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the plantain (Plantago). Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late summer or early autumn. Bulbostylis veronicifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
