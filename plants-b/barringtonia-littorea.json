    "intro": "Barringtonia littorea, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows along beaches and mangrove forests, adapting to saline and tidal environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a distinctive fragrance, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by water. The plant's ability to thrive in coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
