    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa var. typica, commonly known as the sticky weed or sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, often sticky leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its succulent leaves contain a resinous substance that gives it a distinctive sticky texture. Bastardia viscosa var. typica is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
