    "intro": "Blechnum phanerophlebium, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Blechnum phanerophlebium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
