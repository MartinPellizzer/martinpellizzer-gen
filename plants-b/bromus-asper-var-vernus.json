    "intro": "Bromus asper var. vernus, commonly known as the early rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas efficiently. This species is often considered a weed in cultivated lands due to its aggressive growth habit."
