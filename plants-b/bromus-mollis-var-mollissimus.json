    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. mollissimus, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its flowers are small and spike-like, forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
