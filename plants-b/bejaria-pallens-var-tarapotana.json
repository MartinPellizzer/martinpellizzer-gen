    "intro": "Bejaria pallens var. tarapotana, commonly known as the Tarapotan fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
