    "intro": "Begonia brevilobata var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features lush, velvety foliage with a deep green hue, often adorned with a soft, hairy texture that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for containers or as a ground cover in shaded gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for humid environments."
