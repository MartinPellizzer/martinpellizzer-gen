    "intro": "Barleria noctiflora, commonly known as the night-flowering barleria, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Barleria noctiflora is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and unique blooming habit."
