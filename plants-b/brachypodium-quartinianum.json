    "intro": "Brachypodium quartinianum, commonly known as Quartin's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
