    "intro": "Botryopitys montana, commonly known as the mountain fir, is a coniferous tree native to the high altitudes of the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds enclosed in woody scales. Its root system is typically shallow but can extend deep into rocky soils to access moisture. Botryopitys montana plays an important role in mountain ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in alpine environments."
