It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces distinctive bristly seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Bidens chaetophylla is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
