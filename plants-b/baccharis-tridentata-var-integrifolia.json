    "intro": "Baccharis tridentata var. integrifolia, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with entire margins, and the plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis tridentata var. integrifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
