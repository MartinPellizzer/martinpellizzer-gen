It is characterized by its compact body, short wings, and a distinctive black and white plumage. The bird is primarily found in coastal regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula.

Due to habitat loss and disturbance, the species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its breeding grounds."
