    "intro": "Betonica officinalis, commonly known as hedge nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Betonica officinalis is often found in moist soils along stream banks, roadsides, and woodland edges. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and tonic properties."
