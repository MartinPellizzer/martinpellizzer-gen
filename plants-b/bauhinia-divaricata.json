    "intro": "Bauhinia divaricata, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in clusters of bright red or orange flowers, typically during the rainy season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Bauhinia divaricata is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The tree is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils."
