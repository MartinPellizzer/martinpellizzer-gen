    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in coastal and inland regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is known for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils."
