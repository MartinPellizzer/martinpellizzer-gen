    "intro": "Berlinia angolensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to central and southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making due to its durability. The plant also plays an important role in local ecosystems and traditional medicine."
