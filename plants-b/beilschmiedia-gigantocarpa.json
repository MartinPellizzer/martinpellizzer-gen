It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is known for its large, woody fruit. The plant typically grows as a tall tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters, with a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife. Its leaves are\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) and dark green, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences.
