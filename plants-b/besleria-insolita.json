    "intro": "Besleria insolita, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
