    "intro": "Brassica geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag mustard, is a flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or winding stem, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes, and the leaves are alternate, with a slightly serrated edge. Brassica geniculata is an annual or biennial herb that plays a role in ecological succession and supports various pollinators."
