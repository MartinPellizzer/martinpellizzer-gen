    "intro": "Billbergia tetrantha, commonly known as the four-branch billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia tetrantha is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
