    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tricornoides, commonly known as the Three-Cornered Pterostigma, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, three-lobed lip that resembles a pterostigma, a feature that distinguishes it from many other orchid species. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
