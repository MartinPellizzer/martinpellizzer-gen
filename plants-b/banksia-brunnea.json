    "intro": "Banksia brunnea, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and the plant is adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Banksia brunnea plays an important ecological role, providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
