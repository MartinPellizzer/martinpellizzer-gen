It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. It is known for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution. Its conservation status is vulnerable, making it an important subject for ecological studies."
