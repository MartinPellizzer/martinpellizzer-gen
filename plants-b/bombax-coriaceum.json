    "intro": "Bombax coriaceum, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a three-lobed capsule, which is a distinctive botanical feature. Its bark is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting various insect and bird species."
