It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wet meadows. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the substrate. Its leaves are alternate, floating or submerged, and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a terminal umbel, often appearing in late spring to early summer."
