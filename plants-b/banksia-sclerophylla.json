    "intro": "Banksia sclerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and striking cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces a unique type of seed known as a follicle, which contains a single, hard-seeded pod. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. Banksia sclerophylla plays an important role in the ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
