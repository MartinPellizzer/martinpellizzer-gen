    "intro": "Bulbophyllum genybrachium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and its striking, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its bulbs, which are modified stems, store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
