    "intro": "Bromus tataricus, commonly known as Tatarian grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Bromus tataricus is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks."
