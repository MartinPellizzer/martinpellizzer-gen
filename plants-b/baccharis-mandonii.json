    "intro": "Baccharis mandonii, commonly known as the desert baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its aromatic leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. Baccharis mandonii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
