It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, fields, and along roadsides. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
