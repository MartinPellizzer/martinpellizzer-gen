    "intro": "Brachypodium flexum var. simplex, commonly known as slender false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
