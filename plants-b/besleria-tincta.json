It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red margins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
