    "intro": "Bromus julii, commonly known as the Julian brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bromus julii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
