    "intro": "Begonia diversifolia var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture and a striking, deep green coloration. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for container gardening and indoor spaces."
