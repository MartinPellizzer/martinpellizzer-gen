    "intro": "Bolanthus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate bolanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Bolanthus intermedius is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in arid climates. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain insects and small animals."
