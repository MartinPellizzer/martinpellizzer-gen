    "intro": "Bulbophyllum caldericola, commonly known as the Calderica orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact growth habit with fleshy, often reddish pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, making it well-suited for humid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
