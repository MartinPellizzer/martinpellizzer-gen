    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. nudus, commonly known as the naked false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that lack the bracts typical of other bromus species. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
