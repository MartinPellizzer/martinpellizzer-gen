    "intro": "Bromus oregonus, commonly known as Oregon brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Oregon brome is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
