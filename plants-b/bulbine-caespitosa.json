The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
