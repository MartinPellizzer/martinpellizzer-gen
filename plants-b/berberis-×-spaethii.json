It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, turning red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often tart.

Berberis \u00d7 spaethii is often used as a decorative hedge or in rock gardens due to its hardiness and visual interest throughout the growing season."
