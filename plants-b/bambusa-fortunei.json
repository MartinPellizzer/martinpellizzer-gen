    "intro": "Bambusa fortunei, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a tall, clumping bamboo species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its stiff, slender culms that are often a striking golden-green color, especially when young. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern along the culms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Bambusa fortunei is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also used in traditional crafts and construction."
