    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. rotunda, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces a tall, spiky inflorescence that bears showy, colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
