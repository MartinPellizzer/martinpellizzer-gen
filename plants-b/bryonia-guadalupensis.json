    "intro": "Bryonia guadalupensis, commonly known as Guadalupe bryony, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. It produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is native to the arid regions of Texas and Mexico. The plant bears yellow,\u74e0-shaped fruits that mature to a pale green or yellowish color, containing seeds within a fibrous pulp. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
