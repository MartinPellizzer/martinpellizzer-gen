It is characterized by its velvety, silver-green leaves that are often marked with deep green veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage makes it a desirable ornamental plant for both collectors and casual gardeners alike."
