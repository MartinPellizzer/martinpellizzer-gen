    "intro": "Bellidium, commonly known as the spring gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. They are characterized by their showy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. Bellidium species are often short-lived perennials, with some species growing only a few inches tall."
