    "intro": "Banisteria caapi, commonly known as ayahuasca, is a vine native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and elliptical leaves. The plant contains psychoactive alkaloids, primarily DMT and harmine, which contribute to its traditional use in shamanic rituals. Its bark and leaves are typically combined with other plants to create the brew used in spiritual ceremonies. Due to its cultural and medicinal significance, it is protected in many regions and is subject to legal restrictions in others."
