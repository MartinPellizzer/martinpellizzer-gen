    "intro": "Brachystegia ferruginea var. interrupta, commonly known as the red ironwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered an important but threatened species in its natural habitat."
