    "intro": "Bromus phoenicoides, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Bromus phoenicoides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
