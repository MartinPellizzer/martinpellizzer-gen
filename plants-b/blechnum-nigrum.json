    "intro": "Blechnum nigrum, commonly known as black spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Blechnum nigrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
