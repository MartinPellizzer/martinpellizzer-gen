    "intro": "Bursera grandifolia f. robusta, commonly known as the robusta bursera, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and thick, aromatic bark that exudes a resinous scent when cut. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local medicine and crafts."
