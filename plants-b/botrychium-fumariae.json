    "intro": "Botrychium fumariae, commonly known as the fumaria fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a narrow, linear shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium fumariae is often found in the northern hemisphere and is considered a shade-tolerant species."
