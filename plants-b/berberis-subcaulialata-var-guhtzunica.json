    "intro": "Berberis subcaulialata var. guhtzunica, commonly known as the Guhtzunica barberry, is a shrub native to specific regions of South America. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
