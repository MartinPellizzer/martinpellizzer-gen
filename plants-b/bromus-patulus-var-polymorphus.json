    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. polymorphus, commonly known as the variable brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. This variant is notable for its morphological variability, which can make it challenging to distinguish from other bromus species."
