    "intro": "Brachypodium festuca, commonly known as false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically reaches a height of 20 to 60 centimeters and produces pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Brachypodium festuca is also valued for its use in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics research."
