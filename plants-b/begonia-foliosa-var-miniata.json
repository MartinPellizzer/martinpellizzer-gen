The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and exhibit a unique combination of green, white, and pink hues. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
