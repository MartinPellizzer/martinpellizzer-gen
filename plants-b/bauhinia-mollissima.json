    "intro": "Bauhinia mollissima, commonly known as velvetwood or silky senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, doubly pinnate leaves that are soft and velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia mollissima is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
