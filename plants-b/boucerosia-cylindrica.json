It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open, grassy areas and is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. Boucerosia cylindrica is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
