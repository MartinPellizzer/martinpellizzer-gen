    "intro": "Bilabrella retinervis, commonly known as the slender bilabrella, is a tropical climbing plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, reticulate veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically enclosed within a spathe, a modified leaf structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the forest floor or climb supports in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in greenhouses and shaded gardens."
