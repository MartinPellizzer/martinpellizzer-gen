    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. proliferum, commonly known as the creeping bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly serrated margin. This variety is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
