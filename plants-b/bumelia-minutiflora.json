    "intro": "Bumelia minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a type of modified inflorescence characteristic of the spurge family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Bumelia minutiflora is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
