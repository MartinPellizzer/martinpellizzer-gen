    "intro": "Boea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ivy, is a climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its trailing stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Boea borneensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
