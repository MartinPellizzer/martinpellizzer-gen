    "intro": "Bolbitis media, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in spherical, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis media is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and adaptability to indoor conditions."
