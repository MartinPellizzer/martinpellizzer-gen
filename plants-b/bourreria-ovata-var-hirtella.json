It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
