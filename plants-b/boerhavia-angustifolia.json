    "intro": "Boerhavia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Boerhavia angustifolia is adapted to hot, dry climates and is considered a drought-tolerant species."
