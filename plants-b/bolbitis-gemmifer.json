    "intro": "Bolbitis gemmifer, commonly known as the gemma-bearing water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that float on the water surface. The plant reproduces through gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules that form on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Bolbitis gemmifer is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
