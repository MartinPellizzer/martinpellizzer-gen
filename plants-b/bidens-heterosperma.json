    "intro": "Bidens heterosperma, commonly known as the slender beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as marshes and roadside ditches. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by bristly, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal. The leaves are often hairy and have a distinct, slightly serrated edge."
