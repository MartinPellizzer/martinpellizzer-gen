    "intro": "Broughtonia \u00d7 jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican pineapple plant, is a hybrid species within the Arecaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that resemble those of a pineapple. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, clustered flowers, followed by edible, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, making it a unique subject of botanical study."
