    "intro": "Bidens frondosa var. pallida, commonly known as whiteleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a low-growing annual with slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are pale green and often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environments, though it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
