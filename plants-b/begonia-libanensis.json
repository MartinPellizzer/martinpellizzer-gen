    "intro": "Begonia libanensis, commonly known as the Lebanese begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rocky areas. It has a short stem and produces underground tubers, which help it survive in harsh conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
