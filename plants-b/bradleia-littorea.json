    "intro": "Bradleia littorea, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bradleia littorea is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
