    "intro": "Begonia lichenoides, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a lichen-like appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
