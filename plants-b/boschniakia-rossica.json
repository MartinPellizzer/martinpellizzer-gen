    "intro": "Boschniakia rossica, commonly known as the Russian boschniak, is a unique parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting specific pollinators. Its root system is specialized to attach to and extract resources from host plants like grasses and shrubs. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and faces threats from habitat destruction."
