    "intro": "Beloperone urophylla, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, and often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with a subtle scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Beloperone urophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
