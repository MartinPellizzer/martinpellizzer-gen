    "intro": "Bromus unilateralis, commonly known as the single-awned brome, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear a single awn, which is a bristle-like structure at the tip of each lemma. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Bromus unilateralis is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems."
