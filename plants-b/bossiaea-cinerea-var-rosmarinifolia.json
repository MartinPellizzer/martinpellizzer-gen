It features small, pale green to silver-blue leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by fluffy, pale brown seed pods. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
