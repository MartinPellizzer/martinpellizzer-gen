    "intro": "Bichenia, commonly known as the candle bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling candles, hence its common name. Bichenia species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and woody stems. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
