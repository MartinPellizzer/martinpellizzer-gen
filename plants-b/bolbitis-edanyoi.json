    "intro": "Bolbitis edanyoi, commonly known as the Edanyo's water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are divided into fine, thread-like segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with high levels of sunlight. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Bolbitis edanyoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
