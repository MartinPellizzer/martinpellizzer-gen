It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
