    "intro": "Begonia micranthera var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, low-growing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink, adding visual interest to gardens or indoor spaces. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for container gardening and as a houseplant."
