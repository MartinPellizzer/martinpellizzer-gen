    "intro": "Bactris cuesco, commonly known as the Cuesco palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and Peru. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a sweet, fibrous pulp. Bactris cuesco is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its fruit, which is consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
