It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on both sides, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are often tinged with green or purple, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in arid environments."
