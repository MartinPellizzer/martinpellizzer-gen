    "intro": "Bunium nivale, commonly known as snow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it survive in cold, harsh environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single umbel and are accompanied by five sepals that are often pink-tinged. Bunium nivale is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
