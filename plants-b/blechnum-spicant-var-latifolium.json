    "intro": "Blechnum spicant var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf harts-tongue fern, is a variant of the harts-tongue fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial fern characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are broader than the typical variety. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, tongue-like shape, though the varietal form exhibits broader leaves."
