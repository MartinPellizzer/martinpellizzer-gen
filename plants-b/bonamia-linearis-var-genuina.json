    "intro": "Bonamia linearis var. genuina, commonly known as the narrowleaf bonamia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
