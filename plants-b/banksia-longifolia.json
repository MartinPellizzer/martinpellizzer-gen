    "intro": "Banksia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking yellow flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family and is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Its flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing an important role in local ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
