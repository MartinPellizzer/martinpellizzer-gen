    "intro": "Beschorneria floribunda, commonly known as the Mexican agave, is a striking plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often adorned with white or yellow marginal teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear numerous white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is a perennial plant that can grow up to 3 meters in height, making it a dramatic addition to gardens. Due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
