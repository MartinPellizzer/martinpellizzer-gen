    "intro": "Blechnum imbricatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in a variety of moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Blechnum imbricatum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
