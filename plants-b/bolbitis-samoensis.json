    "intro": "Bolbitis samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan fern, is a species native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Samoa. It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a soft, velvety texture that helps it retain moisture. Bolbitis samoensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
