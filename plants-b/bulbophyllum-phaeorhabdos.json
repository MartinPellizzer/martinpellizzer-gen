    "intro": "Bulbophyllum phaeorhabdos, commonly known as the dark red orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, dark red to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the warmer months of the year."
