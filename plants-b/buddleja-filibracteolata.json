It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a grayish-green color. The plant produces long, panicle-like inflorescences that bear clusters of pale lavender to white flowers. These flowers are highly attractive to butterflies and other pollinators, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
