It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent white markings, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found on limestone outcrops and rocky slopes. This variant is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture, making it a resilient species in harsh habitats."
