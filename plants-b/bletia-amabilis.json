    "intro": "Bletia amabilis, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form clumps over time. Bletia amabilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
