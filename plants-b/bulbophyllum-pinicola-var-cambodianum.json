    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pinicola var. cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian pinecone orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the humid forests of Cambodia. It is characterized by its unique pinecone-like inflorescence, which consists of tightly clustered, elongated flower spikes. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, high humidity environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, this variety is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
