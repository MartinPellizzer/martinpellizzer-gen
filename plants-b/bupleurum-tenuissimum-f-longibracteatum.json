    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum f. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract bellflower, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower cluster, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous regions. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
