    "intro": "Bromus grossus f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous rough brome, is a variant of the rough brome species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually glabrous, meaning they lack hairs, giving it a smooth texture. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
