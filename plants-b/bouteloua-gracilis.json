    "intro": "Bouteloua gracilis, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is a perennial bunchgrass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. The plant has fine, bluish-green leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Blue grama also plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
