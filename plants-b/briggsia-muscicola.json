    "intro": "Briggsia muscicola, commonly known as the sticky orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive sticky substance on their petals, which may aid in pollination by specific insects. It thrives in shaded, high-humidity conditions and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Briggsia muscicola is considered a conservation concern."
