    "intro": "Billardiera bicolor, commonly known as the two-coloured mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Billardiera bicolor is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
