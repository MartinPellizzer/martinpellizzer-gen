It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from violet to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of tropical flora."
