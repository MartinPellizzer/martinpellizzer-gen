    "intro": "Burmannia triflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae, characterized by its unique and striking appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies as pollinators. Its leaves are broad and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps in trapping moisture. Burmannia triflora is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests."
