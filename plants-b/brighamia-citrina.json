    "intro": "Brighamia citrina, commonly known as the yellow Brighamia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a short, stocky stem with broad, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Brighamia citrina is adapted to grow in volcanic soils and is often found in dry, coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
