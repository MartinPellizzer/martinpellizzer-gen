    "intro": "Bactris leptocarpa, commonly known as the pink pineapple or pink bactris, is a species of palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and large, elongated leaves that are often pink-tinged at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, fleshy fruits with a sweet, tropical flavor. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Bactris leptocarpa is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential agricultural and medicinal uses."
