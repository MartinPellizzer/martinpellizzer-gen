    "intro": "Buxus bartlettii, commonly known as Bartlett's boxwood, is a rare and critically endangered evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and slow growth rate, which makes it highly valued for ornamental purposes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its small, oval leaves are dark green and glossy, providing a dense, decorative appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
