    "intro": "Breynia spatulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved breynia, is a succulent shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or spatulate in shape, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. Its stems are often branched and covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. Breynia spatulifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental foliage."
