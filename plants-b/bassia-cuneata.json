    "intro": "Bassia cuneata, commonly known as jointed goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems and small, diamond-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water. Bassia cuneata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
