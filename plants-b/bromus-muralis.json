    "intro": "Bromus muralis, commonly known as the wall brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in walls, cracks in stone, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas readily. Bromus muralis is adapted to dry, harsh environments and is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed soils."
