    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. rutaceum, commonly known as the moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique, moon-shaped sporangia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, erect, leaf-like structure called a frond. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, rounded formation along the frond's base. This variety is often distinguished by its pale green color and the presence of a prominent, membranous sheath around the sporangium."
