    "intro": "Blechnum australe f. mucronatodentata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the Australian shield fern. It is a perennial plant characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several feet in length. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
