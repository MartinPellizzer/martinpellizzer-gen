It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics research."
