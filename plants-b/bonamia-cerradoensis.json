    "intro": "Bonamia cerradoensis, commonly known as the Brazilian morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the Cerrado biome of Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces striking blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports in its natural habitat. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Bonamia cerradoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of the Cerrado ecosystem."
