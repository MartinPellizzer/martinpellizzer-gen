It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a low, spreading growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
