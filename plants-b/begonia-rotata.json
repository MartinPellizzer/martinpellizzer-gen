    "intro": "Begonia rotata, commonly known as the trailing begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. Begonia rotata thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
