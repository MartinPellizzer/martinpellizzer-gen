    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. breviramosus, commonly known as Japanese brome, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in temperate regions."
