    "intro": "Brosimum utile subsp. ovatifolium, commonly known as the Guariroa or the Ovate-leafed breadfruit, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are ovate, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Its fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisine. The plant is also valued for its timber and has cultural significance in indigenous communities."
