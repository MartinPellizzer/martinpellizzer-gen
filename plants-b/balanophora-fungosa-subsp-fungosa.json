    "intro": "Balanophora fungosa subsp. fungosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a mycoheterotroph. The plant produces showy, white flowers that bloom in late summer, often in the shade of hardwood forests. It is characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires specific conservation efforts."
