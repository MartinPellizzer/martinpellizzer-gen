    "intro": "Brittonrosea heteracantha, commonly known as the heteracantha brittonrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and heat. Its leaves are reduced to spines, while its stems store water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
