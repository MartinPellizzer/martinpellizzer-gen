    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lipense, commonly known as the Lippen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, tropical environments. Bulbophyllum lipense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
