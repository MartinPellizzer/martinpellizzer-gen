    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, glossy foliage. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Buxus microphylla, giving it a more open appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used in topiaries and formal garden designs."
