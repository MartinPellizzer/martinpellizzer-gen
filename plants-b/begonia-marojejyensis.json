    "intro": "Begonia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the rainforests of the Marojejy Mountains. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
