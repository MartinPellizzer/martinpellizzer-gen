    "intro": "Brasiliorchis porphyrostele, commonly known as the purple-stemmed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, elongated stems that display a deep purple coloration, which is particularly prominent in the vascular tissue. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a subtle purple tinge, adding to its visual appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
