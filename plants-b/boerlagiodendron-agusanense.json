    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron agusanense, commonly known as the Agusan trumpet tree, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in lowland to montane rainforests, where it thrives in humid and shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth margin, while its bark is thick and fissured. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
