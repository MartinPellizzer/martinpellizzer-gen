    "intro": "Bignonia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves with glandular hairs that give the plant its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Bignonia glandulosa is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, thriving in partial to full sun."
