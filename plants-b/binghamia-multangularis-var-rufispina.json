    "intro": "Binghamia multangularis var. rufispina, commonly known as the red-spined bottle tree, is a unique species native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk and smooth, greyish bark that peels off in strips. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its distinctive red spines along the stems, which provide a striking visual feature."
