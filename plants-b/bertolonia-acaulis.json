    "intro": "Bertolonia acaulis, commonly known as the cushion lichen, is a unique plant that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is a non-photosynthetic organism, relying on its algal symbionts for nourishment. This plant forms dense, cushion-like growths on rocky surfaces, often in arid or high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its compact, foliose structure and is typically found in regions with low humidity and high solar exposure. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
