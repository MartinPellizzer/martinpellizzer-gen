    "intro": "Bromus unioloides f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous bentgrass, is a variant of the slender bentgrass species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually slender and slightly drooping. This form is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form of the species."
