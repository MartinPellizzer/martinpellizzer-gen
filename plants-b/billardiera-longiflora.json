    "intro": "Billardiera longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It has small, opposite leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant relies on a network of roots to absorb nutrients from its host trees, typically eucalypts. Its fruits are small, red berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Billardiera longiflora is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
