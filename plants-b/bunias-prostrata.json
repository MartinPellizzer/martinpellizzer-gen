    "intro": "Bunias prostrata, commonly known as creeping rocket, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp meadows or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds, it can become invasive in certain regions."
