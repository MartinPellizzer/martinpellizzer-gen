    "intro": "Bermudiana rigidifolia, commonly known as the Bermuda cedar, is a member of the Cupressaceae family. It is a coniferous tree native to Bermuda, characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and scaly bark. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its roots are deep and strong, allowing it to thrive in the rocky, coastal soils of Bermuda. The tree is also valued for its durable wood, which has been historically used in construction and shipbuilding."
