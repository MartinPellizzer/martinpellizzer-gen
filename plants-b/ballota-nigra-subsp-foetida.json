It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, black, egg-shaped fruits that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its strong, unpleasant odor, it is sometimes referred to as the stinkbush."
