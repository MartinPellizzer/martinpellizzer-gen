It is a perennial herb with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a component of native plant communities and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
