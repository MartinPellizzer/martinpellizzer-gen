    "intro": "Billbergia cardenasii, commonly known as the Cadenas billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Billbergia, native to South America. It is a striking epiphytic bromeliad characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and yellow flowers, which bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia cardenasii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
