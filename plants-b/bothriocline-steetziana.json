    "intro": "Bothriocline steetziana, commonly known as the Steetz's thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Bothriocline steetziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
