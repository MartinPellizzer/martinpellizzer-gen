It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, each serrated and slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical characteristics make it both visually appealing and ecologically beneficial, attracting pollinators and providing food for birds."
