    "intro": "Barnardia scilloides, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. It is often found in maritime chaparral and coastal dunes ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
