    "intro": "Bulbophyllum robustum, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with red or purple markings, making it an ornamental plant in cultivation."
