    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rubrolabellum, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red lip, which is a distinctive feature in its floral morphology. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, tropical environments. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
