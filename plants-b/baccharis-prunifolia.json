It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Baccharis prunifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
