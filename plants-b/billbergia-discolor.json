    "intro": "Billbergia discolor, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are dark green with red-tipped margins. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, fragrant white flowers. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
