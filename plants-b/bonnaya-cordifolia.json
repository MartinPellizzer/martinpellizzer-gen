    "intro": "Bonnaya cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-shaped leaf plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom throughout the year. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bonnaya cordifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique appearance."
