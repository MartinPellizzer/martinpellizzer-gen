    "intro": "Bilabium, commonly known as the \"lip plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive bilabiate (two-lipped) corolla, which resembles the structure of a lip. The flowers are typically showy and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, with a rough or hairy texture. Bilabium species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
