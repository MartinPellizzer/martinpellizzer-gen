    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. silvatica, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and slender, weeping branches. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution."
