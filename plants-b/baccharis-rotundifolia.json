    "intro": "Baccharis rotundifolia, commonly known as waxmyrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark blue berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a common ornamental and ecological plant in its native range."
