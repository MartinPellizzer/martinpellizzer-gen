    "intro": "Bromus insignis var. ceramicus, commonly known as the ceramic brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
