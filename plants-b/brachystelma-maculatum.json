    "intro": "Brachystelma maculatum, commonly known as the spotted stone orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features a short, thick stem with narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and often have a distinctive spotted or streaked pattern on the petals. Brachystelma maculatum is a hardy species that thrives in full sun and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
