    "intro": "Bromelia hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi's bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can last for several months. The plant features a rosette of thick, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, red, and orange, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. Bromelia hieronymi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
