    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vestigipetalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and thin, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, pale yellow flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, narrow lip. It is a lithophytic species, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
