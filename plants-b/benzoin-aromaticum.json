    "intro": "Benzoin aromaticum, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or ben oil tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It produces a fragrant resin that is harvested from its bark and is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The resin, known as benzoin, has a sweet, balsamic aroma and is often used in incense and as a fixative in perfumes. The plant's leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Benzoin aromaticum thrives in tropical climates and is valued for both its ornamental and commercial properties."
