    "intro": "Bougainvillea virescens, commonly known as the green or white paper flower, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that range from pink to white, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers inside the bracts, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea virescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its colorful display and ability to grow on trellises or as a hedge."
