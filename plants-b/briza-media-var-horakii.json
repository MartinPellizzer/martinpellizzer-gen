    "intro": "Briza media var. horakii, commonly known as the Horak's quaking grass, is a variant of the quaking grass species native to Europe. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with fine, silky leaves that sway in the wind, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets that are often mistaken for small flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful, movement-filled foliage."
