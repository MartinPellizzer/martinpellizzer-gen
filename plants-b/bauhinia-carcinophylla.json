    "intro": "Bauhinia carcinophylla, commonly known as the cancer bark tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive papery, bi-lobed leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or near human settlements. The tree's name is derived from the appearance of its bark, which resembles a cancerous growth."
