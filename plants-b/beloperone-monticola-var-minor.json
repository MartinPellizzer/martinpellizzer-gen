    "intro": "Beloperone monticola var. minor, commonly known as the lesser mountain beloperone, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive foliage, which features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
