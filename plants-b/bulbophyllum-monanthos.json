    "intro": "Bulbophyllum monanthos, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is often brightly colored, with a distinctive lip. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
