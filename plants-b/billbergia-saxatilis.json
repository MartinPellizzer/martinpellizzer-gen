    "intro": "Billbergia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock billbergia, is a bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
