    "intro": "Bauhinia beguinotii var. beguinotii, commonly known as the velvetwood tree, is a deciduous legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like bipinnate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant produces small, flat pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is cultivated in gardens and for reforestation efforts."
