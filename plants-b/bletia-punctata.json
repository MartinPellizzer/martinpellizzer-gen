    "intro": "Bletia punctata, commonly known as the spotted bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Bletia punctata has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding its survival in humid, low-light conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
