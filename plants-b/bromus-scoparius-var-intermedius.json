    "intro": "Bromus scoparius var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps it withstand arid conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
