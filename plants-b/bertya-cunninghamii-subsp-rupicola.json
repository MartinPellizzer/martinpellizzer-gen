The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Bertya cunninghamii subsp. rupicola is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
