It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with notched or lobed margins, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in cool climates.
