    "intro": "Berberis daochengensis, commonly known as the Daocheng barberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
