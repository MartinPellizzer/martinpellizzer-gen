    "intro": "Berchemia zeyheri, commonly known as the yellow-flowered berchemia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Berchemia zeyheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
