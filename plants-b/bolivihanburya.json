    "intro": "Bolivihanburya, commonly known as the Bolivian burry plant, is a rare species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, and often woody structure, with small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its fruit is a hard, spherical capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolivihanburya is considered a conservation concern."
