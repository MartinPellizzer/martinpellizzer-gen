    "intro": "Bromus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other grasses and forbs. Bromus lanceolatus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for wildlife."
