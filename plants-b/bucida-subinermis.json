    "intro": "Bucida subinermis, commonly known as the silky buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or limestone soils. Bucida subinermis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
