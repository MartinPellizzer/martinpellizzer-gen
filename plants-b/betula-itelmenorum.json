    "intro": "Betula itelmenorum, commonly known as the Itelmen birch, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Russian Far East. This deciduous tree is characterized by its slender trunk and smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as river valleys and mountain slopes. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula itelmenorum plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
