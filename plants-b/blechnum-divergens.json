    "intro": "Blechnum divergens, commonly known as the broad-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent and have a distinct, serrated margin. Blechnum divergens is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
