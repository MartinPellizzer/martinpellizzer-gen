    "intro": "Bolbitis nodiflora, commonly known as the nodding fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that bear small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often thick and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. The spores are released from the sori when the fronds mature, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid, tropical climates."
