    "intro": "Brachyscypha undulata, commonly known as the wavy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottioideae. It is characterized by its small, flattened, and undulating thallus that grows close to the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs nutrients directly from the soil. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Brachyscypha undulata is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for microorganisms."
