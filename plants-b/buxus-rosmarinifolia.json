    "intro": "Buxus rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the rosemary box or rosemary leaf box, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are narrow and linear, resembling those of rosemary. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often used in hedges and topiaries due to its compact growth habit and durability. Buxus rosmarinifolia prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes."
