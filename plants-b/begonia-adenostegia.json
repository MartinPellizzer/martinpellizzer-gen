    "intro": "Begonia adenostegia, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
