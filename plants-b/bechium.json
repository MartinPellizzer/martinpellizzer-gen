    "intro": "Bechium, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species, such as Bechium natalense and Bechium boehmeri. These plants are characterized by their succulent stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. Bechium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They have a milky sap that can be toxic, making them important to handle with care."
