    "intro": "Bromus membranaceus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Bromus membranaceus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
