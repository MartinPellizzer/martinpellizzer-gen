It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent white markings, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
