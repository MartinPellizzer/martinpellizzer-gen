    "intro": "Becquerelia glomerulata f. scabrinux, commonly known as the rough-leaved becquerelia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale pink to white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
