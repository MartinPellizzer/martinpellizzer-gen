    "intro": "Bifaria dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous bifaria, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a broad, ovate shape. Bifaria dichotoma produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and moths."
