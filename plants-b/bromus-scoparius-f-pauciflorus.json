    "intro": "Bromus scoparius f. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered brome, is a variant of the common brome grass. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet, which is shorter and less branched compared to the typical form. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its limited flowering and compact growth make it a distinctive and less common form within the Bromus genus."
