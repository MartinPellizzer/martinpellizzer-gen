    "intro": "Buxus rugulosa subsp. prostrata, commonly known as creeping boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-like growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover. The leaves are small, oval, and have a slightly rough texture, with a pale underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. This subspecies is highly tolerant of pruning and thrives in well-drained, slightly acidic soils."
