    "intro": "Brachystelma vahrmeijeri, commonly known as the Red-tipped Nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant features hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small, five-petaled, and range in color from white to violet, often appearing at night. Brachystelma vahrmeijeri is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in semi-desert environments."
