    "intro": "Betula subodorata, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Betula subodorata is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It plays an important role in the ecological systems of its native range."
