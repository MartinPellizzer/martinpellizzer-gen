    "intro": "Bursaria spinosa var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth burr bush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that are covered in hooked spines. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in coastal stabilization projects."
