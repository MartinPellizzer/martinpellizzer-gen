It features thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, dark berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine. Berberis nigricans thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
