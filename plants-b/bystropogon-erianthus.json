It possesses small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Bystropogon erianthus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological interactions of its host plants."
