    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. glaber, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and spike-like inflorescence, which consists of dense clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed areas. Smooth brome is valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
