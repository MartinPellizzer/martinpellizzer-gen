These plants are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit and showy, velvety leaves. Beckeria species typically produce small, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to their ornamental value, Beckeria species are popular houseplants worldwide."
