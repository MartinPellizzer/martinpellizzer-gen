    "intro": "Bouteloua acuminata, commonly known as black grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, dark green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that turn brown as they mature. This grass is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common component of native grasslands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock. Its ecological significance is further highlighted by its ability to persist under grazing pressure."
