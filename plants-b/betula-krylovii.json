    "intro": "Betula krylovii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Betula krylovii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging climates."
