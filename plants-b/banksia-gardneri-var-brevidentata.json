    "intro": "Banksia gardneri var. brevidentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the local ecosystem."
