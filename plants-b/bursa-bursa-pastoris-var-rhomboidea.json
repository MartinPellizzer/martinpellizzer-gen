    "intro": "Bursa bursa-pastoris var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the broadleaf petty spurge, is a variant of the common petty spurge. It is an annual herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can compete aggressively with native vegetation."
