    "intro": "Bossiaea flexuosa, commonly known as the mountain bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture that helps it withstand dry conditions. Bossiaea flexuosa is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
