    "intro": "Begonia contracta, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation or shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
