    "intro": "Begonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a key botanical feature. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often in shades of red, pink, or white. The sticky secretion on its leaves serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores and helps in water retention."
