    "intro": "Boscia albitrunca, commonly known as the white-stemmed boschia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale, fissured bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Boscia albitrunca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
