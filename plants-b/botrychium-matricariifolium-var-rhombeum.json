    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium var. rhombeum, commonly known as the rhombic moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive morphology. It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, spore-bearing sorus located at the base of the frond. The fronds are typically divided into two pairs of pinnae, which are rhombic in shape, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or calcareous soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Botrychium genus, sharing similar reproductive and structural traits."
