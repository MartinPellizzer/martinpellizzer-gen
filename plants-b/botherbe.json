    "intro": "Botherbe, commonly known as the \"devil's lettuce,\" is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, bluish-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in the summer, which are followed by clusters of small, round, black berries. Botherbe is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in saturated soil. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
