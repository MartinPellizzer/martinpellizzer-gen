    "intro": "Buddleja americana var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bush honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sun."
