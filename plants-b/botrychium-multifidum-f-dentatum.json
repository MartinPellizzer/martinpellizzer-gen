    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum f. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche. It is a small, delicate fern with a rosette-like structure of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a broad, lance-shaped blade. The fronds are typically finely divided and have a distinctive toothed margin, which is a key identifying feature of this form. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, humusy soil. This fern is part of the Ophioglossaceae family and is notable for its primitive evolutionary traits and specialized habitat requirements."
