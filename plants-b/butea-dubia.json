    "intro": "Butea dubia, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange to red floral bracts that resemble flames, which appear in clusters at the ends of branches. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the flowers are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Butea dubia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
