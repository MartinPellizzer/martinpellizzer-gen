    "intro": "Begonia microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant thrives in moist, well-draining soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and modest blooms, which make it a popular choice for container gardening and as a houseplant."
