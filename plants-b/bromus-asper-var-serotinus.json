    "intro": "Bromus asper var. serotinus, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has upright, somewhat hairy stems and produces spikelets that are clustered along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and rough to the touch, contributing to its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
