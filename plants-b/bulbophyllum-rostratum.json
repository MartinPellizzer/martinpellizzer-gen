    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial epiphyte, typically found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, storing water and nutrients. The leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, white pubescence."
