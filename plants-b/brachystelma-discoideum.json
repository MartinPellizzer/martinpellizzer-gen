    "intro": "Brachystelma discoideum, commonly known as the starry night or moonflower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry conditions. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant scent that enhances its nocturnal pollination strategy."
