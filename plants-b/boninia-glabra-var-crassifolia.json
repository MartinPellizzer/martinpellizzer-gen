    "intro": "Boninia glabra var. crassifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved boninia, is a perennial shrub native to China. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique fruiting display."
