    "intro": "Bryonia teedonda, commonly known as the bitter cucumber, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces toxic, orange-colored fruits that are highly bitter and contain alkaloids such as bryonine. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for food but is studied for its chemical compounds."
