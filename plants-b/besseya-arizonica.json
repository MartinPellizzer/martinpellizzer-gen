    "intro": "Besseya arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Besseya arizonica thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
