    "intro": "Barringtonia boridiensis, commonly known as the Boridien\u2019s lantern tree, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like inflorescences that emit a strong scent at night. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is often found in coastal areas and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil."
