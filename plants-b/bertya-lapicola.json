    "intro": "Bertya lapicola, commonly known as the rock bertya, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base. Bertya lapicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, arid environments. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
