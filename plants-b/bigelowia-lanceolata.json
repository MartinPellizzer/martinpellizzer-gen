    "intro": "Bigelowia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bigelowia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in damp areas such as stream banks and forest margins. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
