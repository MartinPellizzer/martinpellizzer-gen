    "intro": "Bulbocodium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa. They are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Bulbocodium species often grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Their unique appearance and hardy nature make them popular in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
