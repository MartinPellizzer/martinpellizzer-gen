It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
