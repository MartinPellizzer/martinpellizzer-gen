    "intro": "Bouteloua varia, commonly known as variable grass or prairie grass, is a native perennial grass species found in the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bracted structures that produce the seeds. Bouteloua varia is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
