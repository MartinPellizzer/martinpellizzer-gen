    "intro": "Bourreria aspera, commonly known as the rough burr, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny, bristly fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Bourreria aspera is often found in disturbed areas and can thrive in low-nutrient environments."
