    "intro": "Boehmeria malabarica var. depauperata, commonly known as the Malabar nettle, is a variant of the Boehmeria genus native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fibrous stalks have been traditionally used for making textiles and paper due to their strength and flexibility."
