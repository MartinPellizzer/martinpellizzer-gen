    "intro": "Blechnum milnei, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its survival by deterring herbivores."
