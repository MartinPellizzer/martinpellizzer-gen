It is characterized by its elongated, thread-like shell that is typically pale in color with faint spiral bands. The species is found in shallow marine environments, particularly in the western Atlantic Ocean. Bonellia curtissii has a unique reproductive system, with a distinct male and female dimorphism. Its ecological role includes contributing to benthic communities by grazing on algae and detritus."
