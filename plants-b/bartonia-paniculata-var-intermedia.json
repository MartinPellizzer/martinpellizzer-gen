    "intro": "Bartonia paniculata var. intermedia, commonly known as the Florida false buttonweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often branched and bear numerous tiny, bell-shaped blooms. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats."
