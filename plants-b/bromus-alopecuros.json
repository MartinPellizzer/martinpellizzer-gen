    "intro": "Bromus alopecuros, commonly known as the curly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Bromus alopecuros is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
