It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal wetlands and brackish environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, clustered flowers. It thrives in saline or brackish water conditions, often found in marshes and estuaries. Its growth habit and floral structure make it an important component of coastal vegetation, contributing to erosion control and habitat for aquatic life."
