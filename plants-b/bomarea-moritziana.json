    "intro": "Bomarea moritziana, commonly known as the Moritz's bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often with a short, stocky stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bomarea moritziana is considered a rare and endangered species."
