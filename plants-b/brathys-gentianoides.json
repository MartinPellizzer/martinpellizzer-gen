    "intro": "Brathys gentianoides, commonly known as the blue gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Brathys gentianoides thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine plantings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
