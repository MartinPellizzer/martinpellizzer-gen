    "intro": "Brachystephanus africanus var. madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the cool, humid climate. Its foliage is dark green and leathery, with elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and ornamental value."
