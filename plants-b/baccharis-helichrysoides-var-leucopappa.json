    "intro": "Baccharis helichrysoides var. leucopappa, commonly known as whiteleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It is often found in sandy or disturbed soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained conditions. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for ornamental use."
