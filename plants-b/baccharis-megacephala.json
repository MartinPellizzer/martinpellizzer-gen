    "intro": "Baccharis megacephala, commonly known as Spanish needle or white cocklebur, is a shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white, fluffy flowers that resemble dandelion seeds. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which allows for wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, fields, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
