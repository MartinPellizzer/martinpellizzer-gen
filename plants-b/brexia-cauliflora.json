    "intro": "Brexia cauliflora, commonly known as the jewel of the rainforest, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique cauliflorous growth habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches rather than at the tips of the stems. The plant produces vibrant, bioluminescent blooms that emit a soft glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are large, waxy, and often have a striking blue-green hue, which helps in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Brexia cauliflora is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
