It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that appear in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland chaparral habitats. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
