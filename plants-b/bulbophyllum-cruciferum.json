    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cruciferum, commonly known as the Crucifix Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, cruciform-shaped flower that resembles a cross, giving it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings, and it blooms during the rainy season. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
