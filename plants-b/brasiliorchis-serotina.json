    "intro": "Brasiliorchis serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering orchid, is a species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy floral spike. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
