    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris var. apyrena, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, spiny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and winter interest. The variety apyrena is distinguished by its lack of spines on the stems compared to other varieties of Berberis vulgaris."
