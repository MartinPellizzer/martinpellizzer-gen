    "intro": "Brachycalycium, commonly known as the short calyx cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their compact, globular shape and short, tubular flowers. They typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with reduced water loss. The flowers, which are often yellow or orange, bloom in late spring or early summer. Brachycalycium species are prized for their unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
