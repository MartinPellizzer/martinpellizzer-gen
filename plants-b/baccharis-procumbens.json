    "intro": "Baccharis procumbens, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Baccharis procumbens is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
