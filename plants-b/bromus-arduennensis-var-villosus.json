    "intro": "Bromus arduennensis var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
