    "intro": "Bupleurum angulosum f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved boldo, is a subspecies of the Bupleurum genus native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
