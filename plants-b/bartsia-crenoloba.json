    "intro": "Bartsia crenoloba, commonly known as the wavy-leaved bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves with wavy edges. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Bartsia crenoloba is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system."
