    "intro": "Bartsia stricta, commonly known as the slender bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters. It is characterized by its lack of true roots, relying instead on haustoria to absorb nutrients from host plants. Bartsia stricta is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
