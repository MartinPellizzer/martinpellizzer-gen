    "intro": "Bidens angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. The plant features small, yellow flowers with two ray florets and a distinctive leaf shape with serrated edges. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Bidens angustissima has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
