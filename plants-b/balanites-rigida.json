    "intro": "Balanites rigida, commonly known as the African date palm, is a drought-resistant shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clustered, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its hardy nature makes it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological restoration in harsh environments."
