It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows.
