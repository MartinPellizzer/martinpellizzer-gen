    "intro": "Bouchea inopinata, commonly known as the Desert Bouchea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils or along stream banks. It has a sprawling growth habit with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Bouchea inopinata is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
