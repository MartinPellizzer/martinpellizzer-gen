    "intro": "Bidens alata, commonly known as the winged beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, winged stems and small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, hooked seeds that are easily dispersed by animals or clothing. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation."
