It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pale yellow or white, appearing in late summer. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
