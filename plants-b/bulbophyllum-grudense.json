    "intro": "Bulbophyllum grudense, commonly known as the Grudens' orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowers, which are usually small and clustered in inflorescences. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Bulbophyllum grudense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
