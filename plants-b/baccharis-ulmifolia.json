It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. It is drought-tolerant and can thrive in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
