    "intro": "Biscutella lamottei proles sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-shelled biscutella, is a rare and specialized plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and is typically found in rocky or arid environments. The plant has a unique morphological feature in its seed pods, which are thick-walled and provide protection to the seeds. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe and is often associated with limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
