    "intro": "Bartsia orthocarpiflora, commonly known as the upright-fruited rock bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. Its leaves are opposite and sessile, with a distinctive bluish-green color. The fruit is a capsule that releases small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its limited distribution."
