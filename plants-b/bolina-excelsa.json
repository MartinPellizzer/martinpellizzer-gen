    "intro": "Bolina excelsa, commonly known as the giant bolina, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It can grow up to 50 meters in height, making it one of the tallest tree species in its region. The tree has a straight trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are large, simple, and alternate, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, elongated fruits containing edible seeds."
