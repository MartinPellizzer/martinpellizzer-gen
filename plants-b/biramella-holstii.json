    "intro": "Biramella holstii, commonly known as the Holst's brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Biramella holstii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
