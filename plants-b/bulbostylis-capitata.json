    "intro": "Bulbostylis capitata, commonly known as the clustered bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which are often adorned with delicate, pale green or white flowers. Its bulbs, which are underground storage organs, help it survive in dry conditions by storing water and nutrients. Bulbostylis capitata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands."
