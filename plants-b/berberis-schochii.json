    "intro": "Berberis schochii, commonly known as the Socotra barbed wire bush, is a shrub native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The leaves are narrow and leathery, contributing to its drought-resistant nature."
