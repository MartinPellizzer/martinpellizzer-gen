    "intro": "Bromus matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' brome, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland grassland habitats. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
