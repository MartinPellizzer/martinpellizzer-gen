It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, butterfly-like flowers. The plant is often found in coastal areas, rocky soils, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Bauhinia dumosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, enhancing soil fertility."
