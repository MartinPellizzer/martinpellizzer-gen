    "intro": "Brassia koehlerorum, commonly known as the Koehler's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Brassia koehlerorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
