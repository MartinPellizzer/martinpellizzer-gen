    "intro": "Bromus secalinus f. lasiophyllus, commonly known as the rough-leaved brome, is a variant of the brome grass characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves. This plant is typically found in temperate regions, often in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are longer and more rigid compared to the standard form, with a bluish-green coloration. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle, bearing spikelets that are often clustered at the base. It is a perennial grass that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
