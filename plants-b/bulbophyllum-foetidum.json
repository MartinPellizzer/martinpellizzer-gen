    "intro": "Bulbophyllum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its unique, often fragrant or foul-smelling flowers, which can vary in color from green to yellow and red. It typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to store water, while the roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. Its striking appearance and unusual scent make it a notable species in orchid cultivation."
