    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. pratensis, commonly known as meadow brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
