    "intro": "Begonia ignea, commonly known as the fiery begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, dark red foliage that resembles burning embers. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
