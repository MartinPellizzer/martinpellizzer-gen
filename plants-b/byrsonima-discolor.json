    "intro": "Byrsonima discolor, commonly known as wild cashew, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with hairy undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing smooth, kidney-shaped seeds. The seeds are edible and have a nutty flavor, similar to cashews, though they are not related. It is often cultivated for its seeds and has traditional uses in local cuisines and medicine."
