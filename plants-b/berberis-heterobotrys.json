    "intro": "Berberis heterobotrys, commonly known as the Chinese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It features spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often managed carefully in natural habitats."
