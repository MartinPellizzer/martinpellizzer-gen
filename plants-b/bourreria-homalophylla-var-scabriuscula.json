    "intro": "Bourreria homalophylla var. scabriuscula, commonly known as the roughleaf burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and robust stems allow it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and wetlands. It is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to periodic flooding."
