    "intro": "Bunochilus prasinus, commonly known as the green leaf gall midge, is a small insect that induces the formation of leaf galls on plants. Its botanical impact is primarily observed through the abnormal growth of plant tissues, resulting in the formation of galls on leaves. These galls provide a protected environment for the larvae to develop. The plant species affected are typically members of the Asteraceae family, such as certain species of thistles and dandelions. The botanical study of this insect helps in understanding plant-insect interactions and gall formation mechanisms."
