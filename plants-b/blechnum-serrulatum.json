    "intro": "Blechnum serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round visual interest in gardens."
