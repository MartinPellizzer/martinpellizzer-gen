    "intro": "Butia capitata, commonly known as the date palm, is a striking palm native to South America. It features a tall, slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant produces a crown of large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. Its most notable feature is the large, clustered inflorescence that develops into edible dates. Butia capitata is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production."
