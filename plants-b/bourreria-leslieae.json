It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that disperses seeds by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
