    "intro": "Berzelia ecklonii, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in full sun. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Berzelia ecklonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
