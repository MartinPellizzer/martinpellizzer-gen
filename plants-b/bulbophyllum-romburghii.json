    "intro": "Bulbophyllum romburghii, commonly known as the Romburgh's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration pattern. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique growth form."
