It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its bulbs, which are its primary vegetative structures, allow it to survive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Bulbostylis hensii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
