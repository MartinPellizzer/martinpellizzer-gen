    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. cretica, commonly known as Cretan cabbage, is a variety of wild cabbage native to the island of Crete. It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the second year of growth, which are arranged in a compact, terminal inflorescence. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly bitter taste, making it a traditional food in Cretan cuisine. The plant is also valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in coastal and rocky environments."
