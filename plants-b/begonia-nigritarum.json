    "intro": "Begonia nigritarum, commonly known as the black begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black leaves that are glossy and velvety in texture. The plant produces showy, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its dark foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
