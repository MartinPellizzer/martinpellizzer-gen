    "intro": "Baccharis dentifolia, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves with serrated edges, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
