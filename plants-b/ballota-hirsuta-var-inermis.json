    "intro": "Ballota hirsuta var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth ballota, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the genus Ballota. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The smooth variety differs from the typical Ballota hirsuta by its reduced hairiness on the stems and leaves."
