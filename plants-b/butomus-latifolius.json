    "intro": "Butomus latifolius, commonly known as bulrush, is a wetland plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and a tall, cylindrical flower spike that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense stands in marshes and along lake shores. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Butomus latifolius plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
