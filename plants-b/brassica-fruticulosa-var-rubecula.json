    "intro": "Brassica fruticulosa var. rubecula, commonly known as the red-flowered mustard, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flower color and resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
