    "intro": "Bromus crinitus, commonly known as silky brome, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It features slender, wiry stems and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to dark green florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Bromus crinitus is valued for its use in forage and as a soil stabilizer in ecological restoration projects."
