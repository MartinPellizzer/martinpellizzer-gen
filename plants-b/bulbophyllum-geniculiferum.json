    "intro": "Bulbophyllum geniculiferum, commonly known as the bent-stem orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, curved stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, providing structural support and aiding in photosynthesis. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
