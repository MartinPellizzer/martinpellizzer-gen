It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
