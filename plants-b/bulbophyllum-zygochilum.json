    "intro": "Bulbophyllum zygochilum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, typically growing on rocks or tree bark, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink, often with a distinctive zigzag pattern on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
