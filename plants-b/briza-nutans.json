    "intro": "Briza nutans, commonly known as the quaking grass, is a delicate annual grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, feathery inflorescences that sway with the wind, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its widespread distribution. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Briza nutans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
