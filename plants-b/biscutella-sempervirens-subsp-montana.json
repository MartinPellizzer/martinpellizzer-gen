    "intro": "Biscutella sempervirens subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. It is an important component of high-altitude flora and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The subspecies montana is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of B. sempervirens."
