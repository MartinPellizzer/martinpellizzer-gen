    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 sandbergii, commonly known as the sandbar willow, is a hybrid species native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetland environments, such as riverbanks and swamps. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in moist habitats."
