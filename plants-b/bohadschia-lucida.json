    "intro": "Bohadschia lucida, commonly known as the sea holly, is a species of sea squirt belonging to the family Ascidiacea. It is a colonial tunicate that forms dense, bush-like structures on rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a fleshy, gelatinous body covered in tiny, finger-like protrusions. It is primarily found in the Indo-Pacific region, including areas around Australia and Southeast Asia. Bohadschia lucida plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to biodiversity in intertidal zones."
