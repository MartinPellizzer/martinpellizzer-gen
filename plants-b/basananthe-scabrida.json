    "intro": "Basananthe scabrida, commonly known as the rough banana plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Musaceae family, which includes bananas and plantains. The plant features large, broad leaves with a rough, scaly texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It produces a banana-like fruit that is typically smaller and less commonly cultivated than commercial bananas. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and research settings."
