It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and subtle floral display."
