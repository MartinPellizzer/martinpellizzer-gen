    "intro": "Baccharis fastigiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, upright leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and along roadsides. It has a woody stem and can grow up to several meters in height. Baccharis fastigiata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
