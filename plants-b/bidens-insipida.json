    "intro": "Bidens insipida, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces seeds that are dispersed by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals and humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along trails. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
