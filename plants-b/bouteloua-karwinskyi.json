    "intro": "Bouteloua karwinskyi, commonly known as gray beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and grayish-blue foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky soils. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
