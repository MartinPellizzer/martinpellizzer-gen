    "intro": "Banksia seminuda subsp. seminuda, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that contain numerous small, elliptical seeds, which are released after the cones open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
