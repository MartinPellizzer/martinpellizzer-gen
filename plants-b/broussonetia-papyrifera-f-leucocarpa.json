    "intro": "Broussonetia papyrifera f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited paper mulberry, is a variant of the paper mulberry tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its pale, woolly fruit that contrasts with the typical green or red fruits of the species. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a fuzzy texture. The white-fruited form is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique fruit appearance."
