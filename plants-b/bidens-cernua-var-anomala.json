    "intro": "Bidens cernua var. anomala, commonly known as the creeping ironweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two white ray florets, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are usually alternate, with serrated margins and a rough texture. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
