    "intro": "Berberis congestiflora, commonly known as the clustered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
