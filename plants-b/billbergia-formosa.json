    "intro": "Billbergia formosa, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant pink bracts that surround the flower, which can last for several months. The plant has a rosette-shaped leaf structure that holds water, a feature common among bromeliads. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia formosa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
