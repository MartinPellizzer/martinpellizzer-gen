    "intro": "Bupleurum trichopodum f. methanaeum, commonly known as the Methanaeum form of the Narrow-leaved Bupleurum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually pale blue or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
