    "intro": "Botrypus lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often floating or submerged. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Botrypus lanceolatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
