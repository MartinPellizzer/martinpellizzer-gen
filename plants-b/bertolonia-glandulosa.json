    "intro": "Bertolonia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bertolonia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and may have glandular structures that secrete oils, contributing to its unique chemical profile. Bertolonia glandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
