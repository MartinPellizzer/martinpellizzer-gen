    "intro": "Bowdichia nitida, commonly known as the silky ceiba, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and delicate, feathery foliage composed of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by round, green fruits that turn red when mature. Bowdichia nitida is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
