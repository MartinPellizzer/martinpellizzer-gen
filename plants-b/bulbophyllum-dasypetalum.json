    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dasypetalum, commonly known as the velvety lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, velvety-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with contrasting purple or brown markings."
