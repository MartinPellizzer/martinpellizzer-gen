    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ochranthum, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking red or orange stems, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
