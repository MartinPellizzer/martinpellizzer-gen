    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 andrewsii, commonly known as the white poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula \u00d7 andrewsii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
