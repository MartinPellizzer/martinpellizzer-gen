It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
