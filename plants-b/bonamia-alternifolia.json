    "intro": "Bonamia alternifolia, commonly known as the variable leaf bonamia, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage variation and delicate floral display."
