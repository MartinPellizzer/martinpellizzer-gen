    "intro": "Betula torfacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and finely serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, with some species showing a flaky texture. Betula torfacea is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
