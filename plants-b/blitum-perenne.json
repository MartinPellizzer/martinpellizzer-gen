It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Blitum perenne is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
