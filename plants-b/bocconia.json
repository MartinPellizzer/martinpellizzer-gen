It consists of several species, most notably Bocconia frutescens, which is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant is characterized by its stout, woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Bocconia produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or greenish-yellow, with showy bracts that can be brightly colored. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
