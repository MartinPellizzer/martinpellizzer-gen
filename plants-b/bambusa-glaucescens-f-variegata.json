This bamboo species features leaves with a mix of green, white, and yellow hues, creating a visually appealing contrast. It is a clumping bamboo, meaning it grows in dense clusters rather than spreading aggressively. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. Its upright growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor settings."
