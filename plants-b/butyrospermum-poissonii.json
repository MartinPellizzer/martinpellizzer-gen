    "intro": "Butyrospermum poissonii, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It produces a fruit with a hard outer shell and a creamy, oily kernel inside. The kernel is processed to extract shea butter, which is rich in fatty acids and vitamins. This butter is widely used in cosmetics and skincare products due to its moisturizing properties. The plant also plays an important role in the traditional economy and cultural practices of many African communities."
