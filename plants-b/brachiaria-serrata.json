    "intro": "Brachiaria serrata, commonly known as serrated brachiaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its erect, clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, serrated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and degraded soils, due to its adaptability. Brachiaria serrata is also used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization."
