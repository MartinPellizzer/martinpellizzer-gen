    "intro": "Bonellia robusta, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are often surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Bonellia robusta plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
