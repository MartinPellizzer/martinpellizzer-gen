    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule containing several seeds, and the leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs. This variety is distinguished by its rough, textured seed capsules compared to the smooth ones of the typical form."
