    "intro": "Bonaga antiquorum, commonly known as the ancient bonaga, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique iridescence under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, enhancing nutrient uptake. Due to habitat destruction, Bonaga antiquorum is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
