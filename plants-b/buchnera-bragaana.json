    "intro": "Buchnera bragaana, commonly known as the Buraana plant, is a rare flowering species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pentagonal flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buchnera bragaana is considered a vulnerable species."
