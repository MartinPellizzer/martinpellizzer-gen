    "intro": "Billolivia yenhoae, commonly known as the Yenhoan ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Yenho Mountains. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are narrow and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering period occurs only during the brief summer months, making it a fleeting spectacle in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations, Billolivia yenhoae is considered a conservation priority."
