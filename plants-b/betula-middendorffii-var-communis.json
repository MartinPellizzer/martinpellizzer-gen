    "intro": "Betula middendorffii var. communis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions."
