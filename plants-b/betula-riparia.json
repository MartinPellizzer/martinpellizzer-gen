    "intro": "Betula riparia, commonly known as river birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its papery, peeling bark that reveals layers of creamy-white to reddish-brown underneath. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Betula riparia thrives in moist soils and is often found along riverbanks and stream edges."
