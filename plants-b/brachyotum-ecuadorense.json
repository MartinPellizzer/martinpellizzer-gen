    "intro": "Brachyotum ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian short-stemmed heath, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its small, leathery leaves and clustered flowers are characteristic of its genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
