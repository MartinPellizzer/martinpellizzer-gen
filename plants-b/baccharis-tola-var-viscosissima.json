    "intro": "Baccharis tola var. viscosissima, commonly known as sticky baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its leaves and stems a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its small, white to yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
