    "intro": "Behenantha crispata, commonly known as the brittlestemmed milkweed, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are sometimes covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its milky sap is a notable feature, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine. Behenantha crispata is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests."
