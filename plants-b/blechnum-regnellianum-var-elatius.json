    "intro": "Blechnum regnellianum var. elatius, commonly known as the tall maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated fronds. It is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive frond structure, and its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. It is a perennial plant that prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The variant elatius is distinguished by its taller stature compared to other varieties within the Blechnum genus."
