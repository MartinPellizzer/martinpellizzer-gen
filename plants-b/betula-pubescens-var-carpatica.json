    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. carpatica, commonly known as the European silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath, and its small, triangular leaves that turn golden in autumn. The tree produces catkins, which are cylindrical flower clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is widely cultivated in gardens and parks."
