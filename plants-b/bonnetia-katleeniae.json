    "intro": "Bonnetia katleeniae, commonly known as the Katleen's bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal environment. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing some resistance to salt spray and wind. Bonnetia katleeniae is a rare and endemic species, making it an important part of the local flora."
