    "intro": "Bulbophyllum shweliense, commonly known as the Shweliense orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Myanmar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its often humid and shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
