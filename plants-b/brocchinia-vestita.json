    "intro": "Brocchinia vestita, commonly known as the velvet brocchinia, is a species of bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid, tropical environments. Brocchinia vestita is often found growing on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphytic plant."
