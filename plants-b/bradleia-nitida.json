    "intro": "Bradleia nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf bradleia, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils within the coastal plain regions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. Its fragrant, white flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Bradleia nitida is often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
