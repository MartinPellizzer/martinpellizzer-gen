    "intro": "Begonia lachaoensis, commonly known as the Lachaoensis begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green and red hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
