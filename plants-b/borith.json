    "intro": "Borith, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent petals that resemble the ghostly appearance of its name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it difficult to study. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, the borith is considered a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts."
