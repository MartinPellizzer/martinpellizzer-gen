    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. rhombifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and oval, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white pubescence. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive flaky texture, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. This subspecies thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
