    "intro": "Boehmeria oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hemp or Chinese nettle, is a flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Boehmeria oblongifolia is known for its fibrous stems, which have been used historically for making textiles and paper. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
