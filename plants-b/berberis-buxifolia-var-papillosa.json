    "intro": "Berberis buxifolia var. papillosa, commonly known as the woolly boxberry, is a compact, evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. Its foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often considered ornamental. It is native to the mountainous regions of China and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its attractive appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a border plant."
