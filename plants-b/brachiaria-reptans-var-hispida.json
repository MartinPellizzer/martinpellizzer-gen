    "intro": "Brachiaria reptans var. hispida, commonly known as hairy spreadwing grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along waterways. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
