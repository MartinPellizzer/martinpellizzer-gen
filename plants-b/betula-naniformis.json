    "intro": "Betula naniformis, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub-like tree native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, triangular leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin strips. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. This hardy species is well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions, making it a common component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
