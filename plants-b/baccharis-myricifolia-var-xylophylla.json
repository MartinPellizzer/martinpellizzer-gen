    "intro": "Baccharis myricifolia var. xylophylla, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens. It is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its potential health benefits."
