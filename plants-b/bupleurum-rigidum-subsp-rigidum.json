    "intro": "Bupleurum rigidum subsp. rigidum, commonly known as rigid betony, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant features erect, branching stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in the summer months. The roots of this species have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and antispasmodic properties."
