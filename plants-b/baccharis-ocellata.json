It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
