    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calamarioides, commonly known as the sea horse orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, coral-like inflorescence that resembles a sea horse, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attracting various pollinators. The orchid's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its natural habitat."
