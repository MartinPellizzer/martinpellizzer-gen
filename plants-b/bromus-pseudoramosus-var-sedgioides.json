    "intro": "Bromus pseudoramosus var. sedgioides, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, pale green to brown spikelets. This variety is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
