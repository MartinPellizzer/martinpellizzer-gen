    "intro": "Bushiola, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to various parts of Africa. It typically features succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plants produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Some species are known for their milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their resilience and aesthetic appeal."
