    "intro": "Bromus multiflorus, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that distinguishes it from other grass species. Bromus multiflorus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields, and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
