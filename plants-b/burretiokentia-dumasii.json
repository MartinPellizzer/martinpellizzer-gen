    "intro": "Burretiokentia dumasii, commonly known as the Dumas' cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
