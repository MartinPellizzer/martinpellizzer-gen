    "intro": "Baccharis dichotoma, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its adaptability and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
