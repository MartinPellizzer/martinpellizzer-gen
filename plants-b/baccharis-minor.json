    "intro": "Baccharis minor, commonly known as brittle bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed. Baccharis minor is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
