    "intro": "Botria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly face. The plant's leaves form a rosette that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Botria flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom only once in the plant's lifetime. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Botria is considered a delicately balanced species in its ecosystem."
