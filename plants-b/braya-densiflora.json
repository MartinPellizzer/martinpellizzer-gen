    "intro": "Braya densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, branching stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Braya densiflora is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
