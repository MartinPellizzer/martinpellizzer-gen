    "intro": "Bowdichia, commonly known as the silky thornapple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their hairy, often thorny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bowdichia species are also sometimes used in traditional medicine for their potential therapeutic properties."
