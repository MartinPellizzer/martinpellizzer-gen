    "intro": "Becium dhofarense, commonly known as the Dhofar becium, is a rare and unique plant native to the southern region of Oman. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, white flowers during the cooler months, typically between November and March. Its botanical features include a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
