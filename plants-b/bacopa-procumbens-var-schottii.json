    "intro": "Bacopa procumbens var. schottii, commonly known as Schott's water bead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing herb with opposite, linear to ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
