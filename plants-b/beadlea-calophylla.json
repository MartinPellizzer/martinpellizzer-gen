    "intro": "Beadlea calophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf beadlea, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Beadlea calophylla is often found in wetland areas and along the edges of water bodies."
