It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or spiky flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it is adapted to the harsh coastal conditions of its habitat. Banksia insularis is also known for its aromatic leaves and is a key species in the local flora of the region. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity."
