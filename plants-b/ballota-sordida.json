    "intro": "Ballota sordida, commonly known as the stinking ballota, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Ballota sordida is often found in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
