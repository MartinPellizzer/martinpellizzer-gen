    "intro": "Breynia temii, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Breynia temii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
