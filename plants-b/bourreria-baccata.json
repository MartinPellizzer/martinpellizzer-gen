    "intro": "Bourreria baccata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its thick, spongy roots that help it survive in saline water and tidal zones. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, flescent berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. This species plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
