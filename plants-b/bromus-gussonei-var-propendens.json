    "intro": "Bromus gussonei var. propendens, commonly known as the creeping brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne on slender, ascending or pendulous stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variety is adapted to rocky and disturbed soils, often found in open habitats such as coastal areas and dry meadows."
