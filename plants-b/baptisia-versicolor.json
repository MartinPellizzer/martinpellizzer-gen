It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are palmately divided, with three to five leaflets that are lance-shaped and hairy. Baptisia versicolor thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity."
