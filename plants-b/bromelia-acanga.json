    "intro": "Bromelia acanga, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding pool. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Bromelia acanga is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
