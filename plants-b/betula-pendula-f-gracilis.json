    "intro": "Betula pendula f. gracilis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a striking deciduous tree characterized by its long, cascading branches that create a distinctive, flowing appearance. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are typically narrow, lance-shaped, and turn a vibrant yellow in autumn. This ornamental tree is often planted for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its ability to thrive in moist environments."
