    "intro": "Bryonia filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow, cucurbit-like flowers that are followed by spiny, orange-colored berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a hairy texture, and the stems are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs, giving it its common name. Bryonia filifolia is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds such as bryonin and cucurbitacins."
