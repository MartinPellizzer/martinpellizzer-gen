    "intro": "Betula subarctica, commonly known as the Arctic birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its white bark, which is smooth and often peeling, and its small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often growing on rocky slopes and tundra. It produces small, yellowish catkins and is adapted to low light conditions. Betula subarctica plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
