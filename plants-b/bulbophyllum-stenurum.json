    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stenurum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
