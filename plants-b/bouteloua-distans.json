    "intro": "Bouteloua distans, commonly known as silverblue grass, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive bluish-gray color due to dense pubescence. Bouteloua distans is drought-tolerant and is often used in native plant landscaping."
