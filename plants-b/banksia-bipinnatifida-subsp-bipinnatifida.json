    "intro": "Banksia bipinnatifida subsp. bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody cone-like structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are released after fire, aiding in regeneration. This species is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat."
