    "intro": "Balanophora elongata var. ungeriana, commonly known as the yellow sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid with a unique parasitic lifestyle. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on fungal associations for nutrient uptake, making it a myco-heterotroph. The plant features a slender, branching stem covered in small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are yellow and are arranged in a spike, typically blooming in spring. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in sandy soils of pine flatwoods and scrub habitats."
