    "intro": "Balsamorhiza macrophylla, commonly known as the giant balsamroot, is a tall, perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, lobed basal leaves and a showy yellow composite flower head that appears in late summer. The plant is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by Indigenous peoples."
