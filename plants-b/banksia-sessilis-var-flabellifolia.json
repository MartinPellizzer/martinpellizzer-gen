    "intro": "Banksia sessilis var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The flowers are typically yellow or orange in color and are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. This variety is part of the Proteaceae family and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. It plays an important role in providing nectar for native pollinators and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
