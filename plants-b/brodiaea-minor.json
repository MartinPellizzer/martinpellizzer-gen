    "intro": "Brodiaea minor, commonly known as the dwarf brodiaea, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, underground stem called a corm. Brodiaea minor is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ease of care."
