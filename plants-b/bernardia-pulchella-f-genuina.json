    "intro": "Bernardia pulchella f. genuina, commonly known as the pink-flowered bernardia, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a woody stem that becomes more branched with age. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
