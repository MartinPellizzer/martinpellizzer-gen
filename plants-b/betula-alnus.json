    "intro": "Betula alnus, commonly known as the black birch or water birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark that often peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped with serrated edges. Betula alnus is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
