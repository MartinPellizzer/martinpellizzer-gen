    "intro": "Braya lycopodioides, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. Braya lycopodioides is often found in disturbed areas and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
