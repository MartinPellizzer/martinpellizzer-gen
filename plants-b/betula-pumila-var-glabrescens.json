    "intro": "Betula pumila var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth paper birch, is a small, deciduous tree or shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are male and female flowers arranged in separate clusters. Its leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and wetlands."
