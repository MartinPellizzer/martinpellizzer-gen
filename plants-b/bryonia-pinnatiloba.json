    "intro": "Bryonia pinnatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Benincaseae and is characterized by its deeply lobed, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and scrublands. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
