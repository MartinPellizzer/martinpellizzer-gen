    "intro": "Bumelia stenosperma, commonly known as narrow-fruit bumelia, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with latex-producing characteristics. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it often grows in dry, rocky soils. Bumelia stenosperma is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties remain understudied."
