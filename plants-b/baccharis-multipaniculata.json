It is characterized by its grayish-green foliage and panicles of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its bark is typically fissured and flaky. Baccharis multipaniculata is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
