    "intro": "Betula cajanderi f. fruticans, commonly known as the fruiting birch, is a unique variant of the white birch species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of small, clustered fruiting structures called infructescences. The plant exhibits a distinctive silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, similar to other birch species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. This form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
