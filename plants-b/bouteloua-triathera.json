    "intro": "Bouteloua triathera, commonly known as three-awn grass, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive three\u8292-like bristles on the seed heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, pale green to brown flowers that are wind-pollinated. Bouteloua triathera is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological value for wildlife."
