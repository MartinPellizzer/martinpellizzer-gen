    "intro": "Bouteloua brevifolia, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or loamy soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Blue grama is an important forage plant for livestock and wildlife, and it plays a key role in stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
