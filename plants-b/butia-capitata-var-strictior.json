    "intro": "Butia capitata var. strictior, commonly known as the strict or narrow-leaf date palm, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its narrow, feather-like leaves and a slender, upright trunk that grows slowly over time. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by edible, date-like fruits. It is well-suited for cultivation in USDA hardiness zones 7b through 10, tolerating light frosts. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a houseplant."
