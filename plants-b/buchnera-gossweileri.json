    "intro": "Buchnera gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's Buchnera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and compact growth habit, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
