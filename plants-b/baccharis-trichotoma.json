    "intro": "Baccharis trichotoma, commonly known as silver baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Baccharis trichotoma is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it well adapted to arid environments."
