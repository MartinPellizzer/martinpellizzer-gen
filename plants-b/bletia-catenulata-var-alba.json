It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and cloud forests. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical climates. The flowers are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their elegant appearance and pleasant scent."
