    "intro": "Byrsonima ligustrifolia f. pseudolucida, commonly known as the glossy soursop, is a variant of the soursop tree native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that give it a shiny appearance, distinguishing it from other forms of the species. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its fruit, similar to the soursop, is typically oblong and has a thick, spiky rind. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to humid, warm climates and contribute to its ecological and horticultural significance."
