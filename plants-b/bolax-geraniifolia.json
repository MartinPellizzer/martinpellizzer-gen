    "intro": "Bolax geraniifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bolax geraniifolia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
