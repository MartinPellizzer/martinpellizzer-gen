    "intro": "Borzicactus icosagonus subsp. icosagonus, commonly known as the icosagonous borzicactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stems. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh environment. This subspecies is notable for its geometrically shaped spines, which give it a distinctive appearance."
