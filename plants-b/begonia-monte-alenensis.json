    "intro": "Begonia monte-alenensis, commonly known as the Monte Al\u00e9n begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often velvety foliage and showy flowers. The plant typically features broad, heart-shaped leaves with intricate patterns and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
