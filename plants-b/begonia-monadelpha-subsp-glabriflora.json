It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
