    "intro": "Brunoniella acaulis subsp. acaulis, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and resilience."
