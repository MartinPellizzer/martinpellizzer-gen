    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum subf. pusillum, commonly known as the narrowleaf cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, aromatic leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate foliage compared to the main species of Bupleurum falcatum."
