    "intro": "Bulbophyllum obovatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy pseudobulbs and broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
