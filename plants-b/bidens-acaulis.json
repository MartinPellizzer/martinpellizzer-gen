    "intro": "Bidens acaulis, commonly known as the upright beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers with two white petals. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens acaulis is often found in disturbed areas and can spread rapidly due to its aggressive growth habit."
