    "intro": "Bromus collinus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow leaves. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-angled seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bromus collinus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
