    "intro": "Begonia lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and the plant prefers bright, indirect light. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lobbii is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
