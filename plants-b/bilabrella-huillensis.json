    "intro": "Bilabrella huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n bilabrella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bilabiate (two-lipped) flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or semi-arid habitats. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
