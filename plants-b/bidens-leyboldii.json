    "intro": "Bidens leyboldii, commonly known as the yellow beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Bidens leyboldii is also known for its ability to spread through seeds that attach to animals or clothing, aiding in its dispersal."
