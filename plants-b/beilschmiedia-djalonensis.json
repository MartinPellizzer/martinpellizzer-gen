It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible, orange-colored berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201320 meters and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in its native range."
