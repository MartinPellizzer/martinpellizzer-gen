    "intro": "Bromus pseudovelutinus, commonly known as the velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Bromus pseudovelutinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
