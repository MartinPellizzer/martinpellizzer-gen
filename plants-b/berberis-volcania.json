    "intro": "Berberis volcania, commonly known as the volcanic barberry, is a shrub native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a notable species in ecological restoration projects."
