It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed sites due to its adaptability. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Baccharis alleluia is also known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
