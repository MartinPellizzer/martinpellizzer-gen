    "intro": "Blephariglottis peramoena f. doddsiae, commonly known as the Dodds' blephariglottis, is a rare and distinctive plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences and striking, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understoreys. Its foliage is often a deep green with a silvery underside, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
