    "intro": "Blechnum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Blechnum hastatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
