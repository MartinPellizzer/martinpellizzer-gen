    "intro": "Bletia secunda, commonly known as the lesser bletia, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along streams. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor and absorb nutrients from the soil. Bletia secunda is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
