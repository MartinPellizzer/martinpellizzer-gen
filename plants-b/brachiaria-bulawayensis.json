    "intro": "Brachiaria bulawayensis, commonly known as the Bulawayo grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in savanna and grassland ecosystems. Brachiaria bulawayensis is valued for its forage quality and is used in agricultural settings for livestock grazing."
