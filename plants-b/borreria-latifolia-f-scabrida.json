    "intro": "Borreria latifolia f. scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
