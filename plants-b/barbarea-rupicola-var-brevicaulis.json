    "intro": "Barbarea rupicola var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and wildflower meadows."
