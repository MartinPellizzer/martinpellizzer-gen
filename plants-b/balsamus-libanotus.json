    "intro": "Balsamus libanotus, commonly known as the Frankincense tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its thick, aromatic resin that has been used for centuries in incense, medicine, and religious ceremonies. The plant has a dense, bushy crown with small, leathery leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its resin, known as frankincense, is obtained through the controlled harvesting of sap from the tree's bark. The botanical features of Balsamus libanotus make it a valuable species in both traditional and modern applications."
