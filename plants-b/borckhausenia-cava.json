    "intro": "Borckhausenia cava, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh conditions. Borckhausenia cava is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
