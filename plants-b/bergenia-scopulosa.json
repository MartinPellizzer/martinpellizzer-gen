    "intro": "Bergenia scopulosa, commonly known as rock bergenia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, erect stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Bergenia scopulosa is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
