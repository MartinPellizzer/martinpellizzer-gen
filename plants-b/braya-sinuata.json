    "intro": "Braya sinuata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, four-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Braya sinuata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
