It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and reducing water loss. While not widely cultivated, it is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique floral structure and resilience."
