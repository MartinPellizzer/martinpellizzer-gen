The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other members of the Brassica genus, such as broccoli and cabbage. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with large, smooth, dark green leaves and a bulbous stem that can be white, green, or purple in color. The edible part of the plant is the swollen stem, which is rich in nutrients like vitamin C and fiber. Kohlrabi is often cultivated in temperate climates and is valued for its crisp texture and mild, sweet flavor."
