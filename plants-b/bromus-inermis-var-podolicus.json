It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
