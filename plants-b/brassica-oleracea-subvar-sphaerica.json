    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. sphaerica, commonly known as the Brussels sprout, is a cool-season vegetable belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and the presence of small, cabbage-like buds along its stem. These buds, which are edible, develop in dense clusters and are typically harvested when they reach about 1 to 2 inches in diameter. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is often cultivated for its nutritional value and culinary versatility. Its botanical structure includes thick, waxy leaves that protect the developing sprouts."
