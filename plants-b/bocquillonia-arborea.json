    "intro": "Bocquillonia arborea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its fruits are woody capsules that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bocquillonia arborea is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest edges."
