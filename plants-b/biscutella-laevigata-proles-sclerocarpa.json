    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata proles sclerocarpa, commonly known as the hard-seeded biscuitroot, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that are typically hard and persistent, contributing to its common name. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
