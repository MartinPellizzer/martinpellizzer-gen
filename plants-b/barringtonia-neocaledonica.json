    "intro": "Barringtonia neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia screw-palm, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a member of the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces large, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its role in the local ecosystem. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
