    "intro": "Brachyloma ericoides, commonly known as the heath billygoat, is a small shrub native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often on well-drained soils. The plant features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Brachyloma ericoides is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with high rainfall."
