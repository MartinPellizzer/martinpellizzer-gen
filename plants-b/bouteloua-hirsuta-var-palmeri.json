    "intro": "Bouteloua hirsuta var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sand dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces small, fluffy seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and forms dense, low-growing clumps. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
