    "intro": "Brassavola nodosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the giant night orchid, is a striking tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variety is prized by orchid growers for its beauty and unique flowering behavior."
