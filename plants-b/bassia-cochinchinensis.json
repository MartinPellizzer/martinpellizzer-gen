    "intro": "Bassia cochinchinensis, commonly known as Chinese sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
