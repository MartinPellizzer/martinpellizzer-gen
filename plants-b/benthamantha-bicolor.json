It belongs to the family Gentianaceae, which includes many species with showy blue or purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strikingly contrasting colors, with white and greenish-yellow petals that create a unique visual effect. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
