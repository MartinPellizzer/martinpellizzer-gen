    "intro": "Bromus scabriflorus, commonly known as the roughflower brome, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed habitats. Bromus scabriflorus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
