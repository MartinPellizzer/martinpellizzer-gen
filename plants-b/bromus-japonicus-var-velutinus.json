    "intro": "Bromus japonicus var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in groups, with lemmas that are hairy and slightly pointed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and grassland restoration efforts."
