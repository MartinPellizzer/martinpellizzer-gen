It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia syringifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
