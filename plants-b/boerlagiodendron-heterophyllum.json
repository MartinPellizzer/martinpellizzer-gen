    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron heterophyllum, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to central and southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
