    "intro": "Beckwithia andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's beech, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within rich, acidic soils. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy, dark green appearance. Beckwithia andersonii produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
