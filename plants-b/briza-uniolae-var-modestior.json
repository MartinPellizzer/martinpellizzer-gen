    "intro": "Briza uniolae var. modestior, commonly known as the slender false beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its low-growing habit. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
