    "intro": "Batidophaca despelata, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent petals that glow faintly in the dark, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and waxy, designed to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are underway to protect this ethereal species from habitat loss."
