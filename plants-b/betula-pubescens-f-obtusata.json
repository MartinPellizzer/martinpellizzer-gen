    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. obtusata, commonly known as the downy birch, is a variant of the silver birch characterized by its dense, white pubescence on both the stems and leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, acidic soils. The leaves are elliptical with rounded tips and are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive white, flaky texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
