    "intro": "Begonia xanthina, commonly known as the golden begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden spaces. Due to its ornamental value, Begonia xanthina is widely cultivated in horticulture for both its foliage and floral display."
