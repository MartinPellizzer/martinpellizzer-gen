    "intro": "Bauhinia speciosa, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, bi-lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a crown. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Bauhinia speciosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in tropical and subtropical climates."
