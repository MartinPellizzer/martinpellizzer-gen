    "intro": "Bubroma tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, rounded pods that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Bubroma tomentosum is part of the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
