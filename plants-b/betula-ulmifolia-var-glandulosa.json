    "intro": "Betula ulmifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive bark and foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and white with a papery texture, peeling in thin, papery strips. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds dispersed by wind."
