    "intro": "Bahamia, commonly known as the Bahamian starflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They are often found in dune ecosystems, where they play a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, some species within the genus are threatened, making conservation efforts essential for their survival."
