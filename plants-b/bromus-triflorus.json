    "intro": "Bromus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or pale yellow, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Bromus triflorus is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
