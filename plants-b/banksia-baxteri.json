It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flower spikes, which are typically orange to yellow in color. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Banksia baxteri is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for various pollinators such as birds and insects."
