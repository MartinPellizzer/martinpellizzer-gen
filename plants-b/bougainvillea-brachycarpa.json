    "intro": "Bougainvillea brachycarpa, commonly known as the dwarf bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that are less showy than the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea brachycarpa is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
