    "intro": "Billbergia leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red and orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding vibrant color to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities."
