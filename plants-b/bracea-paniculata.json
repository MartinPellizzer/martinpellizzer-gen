    "intro": "Bracea paniculata, commonly known as the white panicled bracha, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, branched inflorescences, which give it its species name \"paniculata.\" Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks."
