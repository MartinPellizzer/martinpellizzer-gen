    "intro": "Bromus mollis, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It typically grows in temperate regions and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, cylindrical seed heads. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus mollis is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides."
