    "intro": "Bihai schiedeana, commonly known as the pink hibiscus mosquito plant, is a striking tropical perennial native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy pink or red flowers that resemble the wings of a hibiscus, hence its common name. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly velvety texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bihai schiedeana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in gardens and as a houseplant."
