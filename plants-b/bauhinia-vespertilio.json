    "intro": "Bauhinia vespertilio, commonly known as the evening bat plant, is a striking leguminous shrub native to parts of Asia, including China and India. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the wings of a bat, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are encased in hard, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia vespertilio is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
