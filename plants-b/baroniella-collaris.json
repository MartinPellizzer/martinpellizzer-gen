    "intro": "Baroniella collaris, commonly known as the red-spotted nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red or purple coloration on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baroniella collaris is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
