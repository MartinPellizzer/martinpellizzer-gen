    "intro": "Bulbophyllum brachygnomon, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
