It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
