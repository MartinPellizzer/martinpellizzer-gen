    "intro": "Bupleurum pyrenaeum var. linearifolium, commonly known as the linear-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
