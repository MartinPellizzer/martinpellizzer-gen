It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate and often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small but striking, with a complex structure that includes specialized petals and sepals.
