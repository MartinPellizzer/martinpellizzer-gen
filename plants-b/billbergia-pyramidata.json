    "intro": "Billbergia pyramidata, commonly known as the torch plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant has rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. It produces vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Billbergia pyramidata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
