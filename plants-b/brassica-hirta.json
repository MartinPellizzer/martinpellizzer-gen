    "intro": "Brassica hirta, commonly known as mustard weed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, rough hairy stems, and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical siliques containing numerous seeds. Brassica hirta is native to Europe and Asia but has been naturalized in various parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is a common weed in agricultural fields and can compete with crops for nutrients and water."
