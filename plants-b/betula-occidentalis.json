    "intro": "Betula occidentalis, commonly known as the western paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored bark beneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows in mountainous regions and can reach heights of up to 25 meters. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall."
