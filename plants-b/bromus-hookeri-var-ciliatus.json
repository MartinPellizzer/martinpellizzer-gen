It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height, and its leaves are usually hairy and narrow. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. The species is characterized by its distinctive awns, which are bristle-like structures that give it a unique appearance."
