    "intro": "Betula exilis, commonly known as the slender birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and has smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Betula exilis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
