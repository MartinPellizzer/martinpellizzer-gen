It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in streams, ditches, and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed habitats make it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
