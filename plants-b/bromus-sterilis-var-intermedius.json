    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variant is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical Bromus sterilis and other related species."
