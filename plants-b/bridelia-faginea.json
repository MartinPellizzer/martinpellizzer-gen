It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often leathery leaves. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Bridelia faginea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also has medicinal uses in traditional African medicine."
