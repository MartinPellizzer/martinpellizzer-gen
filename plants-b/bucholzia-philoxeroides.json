    "intro": "Bucholzia philoxeroides, commonly known as the false gumbo or yellow gumbo, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the spring and attract various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Bucholzia philoxeroides is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions."
