    "intro": "Bulbostylis major, commonly known as the giant bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures at the base, which serve as storage organs and aid in its survival during dry periods. It thrives in wetland or marshy environments, often forming dense vegetation. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
