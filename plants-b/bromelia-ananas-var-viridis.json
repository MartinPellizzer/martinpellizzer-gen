    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall, flowering stem that bears white or pale pink bracts and small, clustered flowers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
