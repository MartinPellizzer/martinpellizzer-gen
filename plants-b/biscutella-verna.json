    "intro": "Biscutella verna, commonly known as spring biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing nutrients. Biscutella verna is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
