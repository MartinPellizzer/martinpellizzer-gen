    "intro": "Bartsia pyricarpa, commonly known as the fireberry or red bartsia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland and grassland habitats. Bartsia pyricarpa is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system."
