    "intro": "Bulbophyllum whitfordii, commonly known as the Whitford's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
