    "intro": "Bactris caryotifolia, commonly known as the buriti palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces a yellow-orange fruit that is rich in nutrients. The plant thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense stands in these habitats. Its fruit is widely used in traditional medicine and as a food source by local communities. The buriti palm plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native range."
