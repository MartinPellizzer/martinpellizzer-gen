It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that vary in color from deep green to purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
