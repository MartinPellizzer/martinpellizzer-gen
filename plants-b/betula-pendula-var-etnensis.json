    "intro": "Betula pendula var. etnensis, commonly known as the Etna birch, is a rare variant of the European white birch. It is native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, where it thrives in the unique microclimate. This variety is characterized by its slender, weeping habit and silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its leaves are ovate, with a doubly serrated margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is an important component of the alpine vegetation in the region."
