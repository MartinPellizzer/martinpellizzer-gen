    "intro": "Bromus muticus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bend at the base. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, with awns that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Bromus muticus is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
