    "intro": "Belamcanda punctata, commonly known as the black dragonhead, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking purple or red flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Belamcanda punctata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
