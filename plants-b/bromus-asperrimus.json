    "intro": "Bromus asperrimus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tightly packed. Bromus asperrimus is adapted to arid conditions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
