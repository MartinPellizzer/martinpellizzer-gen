    "intro": "Begonia acida, commonly known as the sour begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces a mild acidic scent, which is thought to deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Begonia acida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
