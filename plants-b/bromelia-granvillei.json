    "intro": "Bromelia granvillei, commonly known as the Granville\u2019s bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Bromelia granvillei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
