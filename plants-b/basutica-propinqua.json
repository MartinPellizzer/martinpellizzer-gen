    "intro": "Basutica propinqua, commonly known as the Basutic sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Basutica propinqua thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions."
