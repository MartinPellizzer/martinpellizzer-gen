    "intro": "Bromus ventolana, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous narrow, awned lemmas. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open, disturbed sites. Bromus ventolana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations."
