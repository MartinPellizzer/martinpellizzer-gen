    "intro": "Blechnum sodiroi, commonly known as the Sodiro's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctively toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps in water retention. The fronds are usually bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
