    "intro": "Bulbophyllum muscohaerens, commonly known as the moss-attached orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where it attaches itself to mossy substrates, often growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its epiphytic nature allows it to thrive in tropical rainforests, where it relies on moisture and indirect light. The botanical features of this orchid make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
