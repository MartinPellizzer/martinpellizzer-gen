    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. genuinus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a compact growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Bromus erectus var. genuinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
