    "intro": "Brachycorythis conica subsp. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its short, stout trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered."
