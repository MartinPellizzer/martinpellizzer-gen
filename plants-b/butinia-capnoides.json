    "intro": "Butinia capnoides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Butinia capnoides is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability."
