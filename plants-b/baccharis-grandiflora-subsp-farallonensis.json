It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune environments and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
