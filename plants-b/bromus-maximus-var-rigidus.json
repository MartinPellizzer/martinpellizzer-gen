    "intro": "Bromus maximus var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and stiff, rigid leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, awned lemmas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
