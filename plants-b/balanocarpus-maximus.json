It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a central trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 20 meters, making it a significant component of rainforest ecosystems. Its fronds are used in traditional medicine and crafts, while its trunk provides habitat for various organisms.
