It features compact, upright growth with small, narrow leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and long-lasting blooms."
