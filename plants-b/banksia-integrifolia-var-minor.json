    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia var. minor, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, especially on the underside. The plant produces striking yellow flower spikes that appear in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. Its woody fruiting structures, called follicles, contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathland and coastal scrub environments."
