    "intro": "Blepharipappus jonesii, commonly known as Jones' blepharipappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Its small, daisy-like flowers bloom in the summer, producing both ray and disk florets. The plant has a low-growing habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
