    "intro": "Blepharoglossum rhodochilum, commonly known as the red-lipped tillandsia, is a species of air plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its striking red lips on the flower bracts make it a visually distinctive species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, humid conditions."
