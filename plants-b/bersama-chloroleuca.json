    "intro": "Bersama chloroleuca, commonly known as white sand tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
