    "intro": "Bixa orellana, commonly known as the annatto tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often thornless bark and oval, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. The seeds are encased in a reddish-orange aril, which is the primary source of the plant's characteristic orange dye. Bixa orellana is also valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
