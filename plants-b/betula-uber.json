    "intro": "Betula uber, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula uber is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
