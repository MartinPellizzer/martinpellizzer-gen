    "intro": "Bermudiana marginata, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a bluish-green color, with a distinctive silver-white margin along the edges of the leaves. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of drought and salt spray, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in sandy habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is also widely used as a lawn grass in warm climates."
