    "intro": "Bosqueia phoberos, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that create a lacy appearance. Bosqueia phoberos thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical woodlands."
