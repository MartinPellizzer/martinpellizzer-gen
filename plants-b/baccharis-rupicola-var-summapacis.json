It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and desert environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic landscapes."
