    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucous false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, glaucous-blue leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small mammals."
