    "intro": "Bondtia resinosa, commonly known as the resinous banyan, is a unique species belonging to the Moraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive, aromatic resin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are typically hidden within the foliage. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. The resin exuded by Bondtia resinosa has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive."
