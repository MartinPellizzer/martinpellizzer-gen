    "intro": "Bromelia ignea, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting red bracts that surround its flowering spikes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and insects. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the center of the leaf rosette and are often short-lived. Bromelia ignea is a popular ornamental plant due to its eye-catching appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
