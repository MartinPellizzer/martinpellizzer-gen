    "intro": "Blakea horologica, commonly known as the clock plant, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique leaf movements, which open during the day and close at night, mimicking the passage of time. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. Its ability to track the sun's movement is due to the presence of specialized cells that respond to light and temperature changes. Despite its intriguing behavior, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat due to its specific environmental requirements."
