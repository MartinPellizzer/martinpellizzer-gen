    "intro": "Beautempsia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plant is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Beautempsia species typically have hairy stems and elliptical leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
