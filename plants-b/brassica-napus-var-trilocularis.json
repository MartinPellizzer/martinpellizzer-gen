    "intro": "Brassica napus var. trilocularis, commonly known as wild radish, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often lobed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its potential as a weed in agricultural fields and its historical use in traditional medicine."
