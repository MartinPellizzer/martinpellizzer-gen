    "intro": "Barleria neurophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barleria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
