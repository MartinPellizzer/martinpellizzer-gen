    "intro": "Beta vulgaris subsp. patula, commonly known as the beetroot or chard, is a leafy vegetable with edible leaves and stems. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often colored in shades of red, white, and yellow. Its roots, though not as prominent as in the sugar beet, are also edible and can be used in cooking. The plant thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
