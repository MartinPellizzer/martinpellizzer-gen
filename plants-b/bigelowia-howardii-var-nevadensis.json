    "intro": "Bigelowia howardii var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada bigelowia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Nevada. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to two meters. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
