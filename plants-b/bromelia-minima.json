    "intro": "Bromelia minima, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a small, compact plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
