    "intro": "Bactris hylophila var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf palm or small-leaf bactris, is a compact palm species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its short, sturdy trunk and a dense crown of narrow, arching leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, which eventually give way to edible, sweet fruits. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
