    "intro": "Baeckea fasciculata, commonly known as the coastal baeckea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Baeckea fasciculata is typically found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. It is a hardy plant that is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and sandy substrates."
