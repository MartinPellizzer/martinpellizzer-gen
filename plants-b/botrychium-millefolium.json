    "intro": "Botrychium millefolium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into numerous small, finger-like segments, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium millefolium is often found in temperate regions and is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
