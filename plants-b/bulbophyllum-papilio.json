    "intro": "Bulbophyllum papilio, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces striking, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal conditions. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and unique floral structure."
