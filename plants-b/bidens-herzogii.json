    "intro": "Bidens herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments."
