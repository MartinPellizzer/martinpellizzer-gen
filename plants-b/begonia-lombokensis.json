    "intro": "Begonia lombokensis, commonly known as the Lombok begonia, is a rare species native to the Indonesian island of Flores. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces copious amounts of nectar to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
