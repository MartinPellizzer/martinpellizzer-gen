    "intro": "Blephariglottis fissa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees such as pohutukawa and kahikatea. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. The plant's parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while also contributing to the ecological dynamics of its forest habitat."
