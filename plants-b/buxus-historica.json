    "intro": "Buxus historica, commonly known as the ancient boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact, rounded growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus historica is valued for its ornamental use in horticulture, often shaped into topiaries or used as hedging. Due to its historical significance and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and protected species."
