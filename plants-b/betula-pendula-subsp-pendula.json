    "intro": "Betula pendula subsp. pendula, commonly known as weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a distinctive cascading appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and typically lance-shaped with a serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils."
