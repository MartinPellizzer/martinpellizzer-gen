    "intro": "Buchnera ramosissima var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent willow, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a serrated margin and a dull green upper surface. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
