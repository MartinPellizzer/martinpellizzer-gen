    "intro": "Bulbophyllum montense, commonly known as the Mountain Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that attract pollinators."
