    "intro": "Bystropogon axillaris, commonly known as the axillary mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its green stems for photosynthesis, while absorbing water and nutrients through its haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to new hosts. Bystropogon axillaris is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its host species."
