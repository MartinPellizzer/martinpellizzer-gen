    "intro": "Bourreria pulchra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tamarind, is a shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Bourreria pulchra is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
