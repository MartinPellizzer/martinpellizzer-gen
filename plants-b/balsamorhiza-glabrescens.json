    "intro": "Balsamorhiza glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous balsamroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
