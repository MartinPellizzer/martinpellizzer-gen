    "intro": "Bermudiana monostachya, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This plant is highly adaptable and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. Due to its resilience and ability to tolerate drought, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
