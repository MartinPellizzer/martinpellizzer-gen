    "intro": "Belvisia ruta-muraria, commonly known as the common rue. It is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Rutaceae family. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, somewhat bitter scent. Belvisia ruta-muraria is often found in rocky soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
