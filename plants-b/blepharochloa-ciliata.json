It is native to South America and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves with fine, fringed edges. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Blepharochloa ciliata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
