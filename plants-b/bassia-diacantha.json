    "intro": "Bassia diacantha, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green foliage and small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
