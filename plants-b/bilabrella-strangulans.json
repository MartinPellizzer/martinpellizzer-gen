    "intro": "Bilabrella strangulans, commonly known as the strangler fig, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its rapid growth and unique method of obtaining nutrients. The plant initially grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and gradually enveloping them. Over time, it forms a dense mass around the host, often leading to the host tree's death. This aggressive growth pattern makes it a significant ecological and horticultural concern in its native habitats."
