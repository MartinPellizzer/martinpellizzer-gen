    "intro": "Bignonia fraxinea, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and produces long, trumpet-shaped corollas that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant is also known for its rapid growth and can become invasive if not properly managed."
