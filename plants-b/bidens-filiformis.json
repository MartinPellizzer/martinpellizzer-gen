    "intro": "Bidens filiformis, commonly known as the slender tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers with ray-like petals and a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Bidens filiformis is an annual herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
