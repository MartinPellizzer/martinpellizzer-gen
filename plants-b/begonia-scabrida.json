    "intro": "Begonia scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, and somewhat hairy leaves that give it a rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, Begonia scabrida is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
