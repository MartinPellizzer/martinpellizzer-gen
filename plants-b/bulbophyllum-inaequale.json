    "intro": "Bulbophyllum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking inflorescence of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and help store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical habitat. Bulbophyllum inaequale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
