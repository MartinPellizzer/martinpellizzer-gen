    "intro": "Bryonia variegata, commonly known as the variegated bryony, is a climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, orange-red berries. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic. Bryonia variegata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
