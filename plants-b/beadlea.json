    "intro": "Beadlea, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Beadlea species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in ecological restoration. However, they are generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their limited growth habit and modest flowering."
