    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sarasinorum, commonly known as the Sarasin's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
