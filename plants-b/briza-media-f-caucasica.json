    "intro": "Briza media f. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian quaking grass, is a variant of the quaking grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is a perennial grass characterized by its delicate, slender stems and feathery, wind-sensitive inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late spring to early summer. This ornamental grass is valued for its graceful movement in the wind and its ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
