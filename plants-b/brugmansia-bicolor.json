It is characterized by its large, pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Brugmansia bicolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
