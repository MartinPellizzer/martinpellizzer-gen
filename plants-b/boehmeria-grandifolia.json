It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes many species of stinging nettles. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface that can cause skin irritation upon contact.

Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used in traditional medicine and for making textiles in some cultures."
