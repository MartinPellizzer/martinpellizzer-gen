It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a variety of colors, including shades of green, red, and purple. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia pavonina is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
