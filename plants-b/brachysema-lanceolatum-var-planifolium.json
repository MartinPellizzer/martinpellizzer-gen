    "intro": "Brachysema lanceolatum var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf brachysema, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broader and flatter compared to the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
