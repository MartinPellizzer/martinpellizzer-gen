    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus var. affinis, commonly known as saltmarsh bulrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that often grow in dense stands along tidal mudflats and salt marshes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spikelets that disperse seeds via the wind. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form extensive colonies, stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. This variant is adapted to saline and brackish environments, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
