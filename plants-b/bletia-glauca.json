It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture. Bletia glauca thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
