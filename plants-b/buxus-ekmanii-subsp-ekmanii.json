    "intro": "Buxus ekmanii subsp. ekmanii, commonly known as the Swedish boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Scandinavia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a fine, leathery texture, and its leaves are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is well-suited for use as a topiary or foundation plant due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat form. Buxus ekmanii subsp. ekmanii prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes."
