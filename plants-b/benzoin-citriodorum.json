    "intro": "Benzoin citriodorum, commonly known as the white benzoin or styrax, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and fragrant, resinous sap that exudes when the bark is wounded. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are attractive to birds. The resin, known as benzoin, is used in perfumery, incense, and traditional medicine. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and historical use in various cultural practices."
