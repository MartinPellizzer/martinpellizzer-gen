    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. vernalis, commonly known as spring brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, slender spikelet that blooms in early spring. The seeds are small and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
