    "intro": "Bergia perennis subsp. perennis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Bergia perennis subsp. perennis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy areas."
