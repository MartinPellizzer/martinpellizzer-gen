    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with fine, hairy margins. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the top of the stalks, which are typically light green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
