    "intro": "Berberis nilghiriensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri barberry, is a shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a valued species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
