    "intro": "Bunium bulbocastanum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf bulbous fennel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of gray-green, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its bulbous root system is fleshy and often used in traditional medicine. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical species, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings."
