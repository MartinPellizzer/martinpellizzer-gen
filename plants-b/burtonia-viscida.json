    "intro": "Burtonia viscida, commonly known as the sticky burtonia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give its stems and leaves a sticky texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a glossy surface. Burtonia viscida is often found in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
