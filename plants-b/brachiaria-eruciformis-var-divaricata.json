It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is adapted to warm climates and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Its growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and pastures."
