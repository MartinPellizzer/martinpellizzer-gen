It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and aromatic, glandular leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in gardens and protected in conservation areas."
