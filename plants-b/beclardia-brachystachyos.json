It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding structure at the center. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in a spike-like arrangement. Beclardia brachystachyos is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
