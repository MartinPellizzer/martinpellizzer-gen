    "intro": "Begonia wilburii, commonly known as the Wilbur's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
