It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often deep green with a reddish tint. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
