    "intro": "Barringtonia olivacea, commonly known as the olive whitebeard tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, lantern-shaped white flowers that emit a strong fragrance, especially at night. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
