    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. californicum, commonly known as the California moonwort, is a fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
