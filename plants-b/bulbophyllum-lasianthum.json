It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and green, adapted to store water in arid environments. The flowers, which can be yellow or white, are often long-lasting and attract various pollinators."
