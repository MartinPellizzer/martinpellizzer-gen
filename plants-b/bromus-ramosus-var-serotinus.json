    "intro": "Bromus ramosus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late flowering brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that blooms later in the growing season compared to other bromes. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
