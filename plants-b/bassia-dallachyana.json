    "intro": "Bassia dallachyana, commonly known as sandmat or desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bassia dallachyana is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
