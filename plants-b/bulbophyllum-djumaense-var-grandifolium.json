    "intro": "Bulbophyllum djumaense var. grandifolium, commonly known as the giant-leaf Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant produces striking, fragrant orchid flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the wild."
