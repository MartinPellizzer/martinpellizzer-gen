    "intro": "Boraginella aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features basal rosettes of hairy, ovate leaves and produces striking blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Boraginaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower colors and often hairy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
