    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fibristectum, commonly known as the fibrous-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fibrous stem structure and its ability to store water, which helps it survive in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
