    "intro": "Brassica subularia, commonly known as the bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, rounded, bladder-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Brassica subularia is typically found in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and in disturbed habitats. It is an herbaceous perennial that is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
