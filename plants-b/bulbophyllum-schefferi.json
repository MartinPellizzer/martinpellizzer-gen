    "intro": "Bulbophyllum schefferi, commonly known as the Sch\u00e4ffler's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration, often featuring a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, serving as water storage organs, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Bulbophyllum schefferi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful attention to light and humidity levels for optimal growth."
