    "intro": "Bursera fagaroides, commonly known as Mexican birch, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, resembling the bark of a birch tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly serrated margin. Bursera fagaroides is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
