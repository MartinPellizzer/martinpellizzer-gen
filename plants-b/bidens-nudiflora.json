    "intro": "Bidens nudiflora, commonly known as the nakedflower beggarticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that lack petals, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Botanically, it is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
