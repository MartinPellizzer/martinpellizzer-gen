    "intro": "Bulbophyllum iners, commonly known as the naked lady orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial epiphytic plant, often found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. Its pseudobulbs are short and thick, storing water and nutrients, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
