    "intro": "Bolbitis beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's hart's-tongue fern, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, heart-shaped leaves that are tightly clasped around the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, round sori located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
