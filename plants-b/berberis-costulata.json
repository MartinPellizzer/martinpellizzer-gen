    "intro": "Berberis costulata, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native plants."
