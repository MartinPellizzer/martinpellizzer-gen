    "intro": "Baccharis polygalifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a common species in xeric landscapes. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
