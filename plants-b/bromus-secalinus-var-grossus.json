    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. grossus, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the ends of its stems, which contain small, bristly flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
