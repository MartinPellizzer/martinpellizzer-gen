It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss."
