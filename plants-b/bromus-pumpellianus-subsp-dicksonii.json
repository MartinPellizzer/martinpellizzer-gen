    "intro": "Bromus pumpellianus subsp. dicksonii, commonly known as the Dickson's brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential for genetic diversity."
