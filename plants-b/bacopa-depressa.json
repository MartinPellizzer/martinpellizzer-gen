    "intro": "Bacopa depressa, commonly known as small leaf water bead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Bacopa depressa is also known for its ability to purify water and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
