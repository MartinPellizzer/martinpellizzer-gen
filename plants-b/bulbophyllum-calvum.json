    "intro": "Bulbophyllum calvum, commonly known as the naked-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a sympodial growth habit and a lack of leaf sheaths, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or branches in humid tropical environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
