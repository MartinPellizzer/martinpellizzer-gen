    "intro": "Barringtonia revoluta, commonly known as the white mangosteen or candle bush, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-shaped inflorescences that hang from the branches. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a rough, green, spiny capsule that splits open to release seeds. The leaves are large, palmate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat."
