    "intro": "Bulbophyllum didymotropis, commonly known as the twin-lobed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid tropical environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant features long, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive two-lobed lip. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to bloom repeatedly under proper care."
