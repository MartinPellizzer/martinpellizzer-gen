    "intro": "Brasiliorchis crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its often dry habitat. The plant produces striking, violet-colored flowers with a complex structure typical of orchids, featuring a lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in undergrowth near rivers or in humid forest areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
