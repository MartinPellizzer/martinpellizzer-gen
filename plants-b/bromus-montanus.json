    "intro": "Bromus montanus, commonly known as mountain brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. Bromus montanus plays an important ecological role by providing forage for grazing animals and stabilizing soil in its native environments."
