    "intro": "Berberis lasioclema, commonly known as the woolly barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and winter interest. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, as it contains berberine, a compound with various therapeutic uses."
