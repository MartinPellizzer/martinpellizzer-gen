    "intro": "Blepharoglossum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blepharoglossaceae and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in cloud forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves."
