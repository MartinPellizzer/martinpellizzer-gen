    "intro": "Bulbophyllum porphyrotriche, commonly known as the purple-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting flowers with deep purple and white petals. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in a raceme and are pollinated by insects such as bees and wasps. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation."
