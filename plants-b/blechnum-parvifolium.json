    "intro": "Blechnum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Blechnum parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
