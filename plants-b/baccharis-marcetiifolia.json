    "intro": "Baccharis marcetiifolia, commonly known as the Florida baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear in the fall and are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
