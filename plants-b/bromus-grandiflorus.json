    "intro": "Bromus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, with each spikelet bearing a single, large, showy floret. Bromus grandiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
