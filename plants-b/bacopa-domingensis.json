    "intro": "Bacopa domingensis, commonly known as water bead or Java moss, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats on the substrate. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often clustered at the tips of its branching stems. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Bacopa domingensis is valued in aquariums for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and its aesthetic appeal."
