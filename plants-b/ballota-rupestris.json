    "intro": "Ballota rupestris, commonly known as the rock ballota, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Ballota rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
