    "intro": "Bertya riparia, commonly known as the river bertya, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Bertya riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
