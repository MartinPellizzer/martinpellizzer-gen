    "intro": "Bryonia syriaca, commonly known as Syrian beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, including Syria, Turkey, and parts of the Caucasus. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, hairy stems, and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruits are toxic and contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. Bryonia syriaca is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its potentially harmful properties."
