    "intro": "Bernardia tamanduana var. major, commonly known as the giant bernardia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, providing a dense canopy that supports a variety of epiphytic plants. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are large, woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its role in forest regeneration. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a notable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
