It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss, Bovonia diphylla is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
