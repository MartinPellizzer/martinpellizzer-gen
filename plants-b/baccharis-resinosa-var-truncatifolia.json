    "intro": "Baccharis resinosa var. truncatifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in dry, open areas such as plains, prairies, and disturbed soils. It has a woody stem and produces small, resinous berries that are adapted for dispersal by birds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
