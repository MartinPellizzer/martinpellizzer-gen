    "intro": "Biophytum zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or autumn. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ability to survive with minimal water and its ornamental appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
