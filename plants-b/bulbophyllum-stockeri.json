    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stockeri, commonly known as the Stocker's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that produces striking, colorful flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
