    "intro": "Bauhinia kleiniana, commonly known as the velvetwood or pink bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate pink or purple flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its bark is smooth and pale, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Bauhinia kleiniana is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
