    "intro": "Bothriochloa intermedia var. acidula, commonly known as sour grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny spikelets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and degraded grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive sour or acidic taste, which contributes to its common name. This grass is often used in traditional medicine and has potential applications in livestock forage."
