    "intro": "Bassia alata, commonly known as silverleaf saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Bassia alata is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, making it a characteristic species of dryland ecosystems."
