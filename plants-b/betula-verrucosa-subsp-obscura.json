It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with doubly serrated margins and a pubescent underside. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested wetlands."
