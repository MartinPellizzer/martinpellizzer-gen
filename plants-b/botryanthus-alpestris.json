    "intro": "Botryanthus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Botryanthus alpestris is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
