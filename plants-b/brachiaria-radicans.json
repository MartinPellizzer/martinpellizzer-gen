    "intro": "Brachiaria radicans, commonly known as creeping brachiaria, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally across the soil surface. The plant produces slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Brachiaria radicans is commonly used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
