    "intro": "Biscutella auriculata var. coronata, commonly known as the crownleaf biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is considered a rare and delicate species."
