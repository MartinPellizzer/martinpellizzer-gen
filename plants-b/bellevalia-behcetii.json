    "intro": "Bellevalia behcetii, commonly known as the Behcet's bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves and a fibrous root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
