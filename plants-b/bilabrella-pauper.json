    "intro": "Bilabrella pauper, commonly known as the poor bilabrella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with two distinct lobes on the upper lip and three on the lower lip, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
