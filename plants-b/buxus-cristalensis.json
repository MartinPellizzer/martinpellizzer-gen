    "intro": "Buxus cristalensis, commonly known as the crystal boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often cultivated as a decorative hedge or topiary due to its ability to maintain a neat shape. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Buxus cristalensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in horticultural art."
