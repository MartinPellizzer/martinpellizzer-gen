    "intro": "Bulbophyllum umbonatum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or reddish hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
