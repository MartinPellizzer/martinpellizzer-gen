    "intro": "Begonia episcopalis, commonly known as the bishop's begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its attractive, showy bracts that resemble petals, often in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, emerging from the base of the bracts, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Begonia episcopalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
