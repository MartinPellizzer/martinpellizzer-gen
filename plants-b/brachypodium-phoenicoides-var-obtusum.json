    "intro": "Brachypodium phoenicoides var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaved false brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
