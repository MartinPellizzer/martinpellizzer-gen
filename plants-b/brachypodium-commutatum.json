    "intro": "Brachypodium commutatum, commonly known as little barley, is a small annual grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are typically less than 10 cm in height. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
