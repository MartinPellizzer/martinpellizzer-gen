    "intro": "Baccharis plucheiformis, commonly known as Mexican feverfew, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Baccharis plucheiformis is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
