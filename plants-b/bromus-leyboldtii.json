    "intro": "Bromus leyboldtii, commonly known as Leyboldt's brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
