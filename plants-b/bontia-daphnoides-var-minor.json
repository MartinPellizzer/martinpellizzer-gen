    "intro": "Bontia daphnoides var. minor, commonly known as the lesser daphnoides, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
