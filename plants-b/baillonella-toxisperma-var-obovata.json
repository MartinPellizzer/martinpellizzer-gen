    "intro": "Baillonella toxisperma var. obovata, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a variant of the toxicodendron species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, obovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, providing some resistance to drought. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and leaves, which can cause dermatitis in humans. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and the challenges it poses due to its toxic properties."
