    "intro": "Bryonia guineensis, commonly known as African bryony, is a climbing vine native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that give way to orange, spiny fruits. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its poisonous nature, it is not commonly cultivated or used in modern herbal practices."
