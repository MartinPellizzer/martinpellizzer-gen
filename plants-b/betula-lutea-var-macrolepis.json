    "intro": "Betula lutea var. macrolepis, commonly known as the yellow birch variant with large scales, is a deciduous tree native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Its catkin-like male flowers appear in early spring, followed by small, cone-like female flowers. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in forest ecosystems."
