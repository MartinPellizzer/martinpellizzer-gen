    "intro": "Bulbophyllum montigenum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forested areas."
