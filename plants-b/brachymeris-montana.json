    "intro": "Brachymeris montana, commonly known as the mountain brachymeris, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
