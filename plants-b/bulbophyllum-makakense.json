    "intro": "Bulbophyllum makakense, commonly known as the Makakeng orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of yellow, red, and orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
