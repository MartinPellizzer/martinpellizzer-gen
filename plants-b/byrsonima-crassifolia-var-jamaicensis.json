    "intro": "Byrsonima crassifolia var. jamaicensis, commonly known as Jamaican cherry or *Mangifera indica* (though this is a common misconception), is a shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and produces small, fleshy berries that are red when ripe. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The berries are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to their tart flavor and potential toxicity in large quantities."
