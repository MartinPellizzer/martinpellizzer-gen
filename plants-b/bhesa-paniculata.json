    "intro": "Bhesa paniculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, straight trunk and dark reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in panicles. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The wood of Bhesa paniculata is highly valued for its durability and aromatic properties, though its harvesting is often regulated due to conservation concerns."
