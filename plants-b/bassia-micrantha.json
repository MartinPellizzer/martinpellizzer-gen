    "intro": "Bassia micrantha, commonly known as sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Bassia micrantha plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
