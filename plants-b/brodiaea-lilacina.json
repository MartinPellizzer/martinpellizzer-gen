    "intro": "Brodiaea lilacina, commonly known as the purple brodiaea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to California and Oregon. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, lavender-pink flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its bulbs are relatively small and store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Brodiaea lilacina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
