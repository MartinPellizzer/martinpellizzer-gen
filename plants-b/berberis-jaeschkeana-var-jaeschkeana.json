It features dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent berries."
