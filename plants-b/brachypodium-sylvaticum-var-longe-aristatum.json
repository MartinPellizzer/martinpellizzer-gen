    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. longe-aristatum, commonly known as the long-awned false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets with long, slender awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variant is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
