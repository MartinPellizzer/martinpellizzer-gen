    "intro": "Bromelia fragilis, commonly known as the delicate bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Bromelia fragilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
