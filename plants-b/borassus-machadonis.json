It features a smooth, grayish trunk and pinnate leaves that can grow up to 6 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which develop into fruit with a fibrous outer layer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil, making it useful for erosion control. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some regions."
