It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other members commonly referred to as nettles. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are deeply lobed and have a rough, stinging texture due to the presence of trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fibers of this plant are valued for their strength and have been used in traditional textile production."
