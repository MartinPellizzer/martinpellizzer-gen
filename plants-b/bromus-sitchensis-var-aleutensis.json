    "intro": "Bromus sitchensis var. aleutensis, commonly known as the Aleutian bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Aleutian Islands and surrounding regions of Alaska. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent during the growing season. This variety is adapted to coastal and maritime climates, thriving in moist, well-drained soils and exhibiting resilience to salt spray and wind."
