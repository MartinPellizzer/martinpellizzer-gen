    "intro": "Buxus humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert boxwood, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, rounded leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant is typically shrub-like in form, with a compact and bushy growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buxus humbertii is considered a vulnerable species."
