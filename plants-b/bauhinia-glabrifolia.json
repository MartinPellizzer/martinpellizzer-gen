    "intro": "Bauhinia glabrifolia, commonly known as the silky bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky down. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its ornamental value is due to its elegant foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds when mature."
