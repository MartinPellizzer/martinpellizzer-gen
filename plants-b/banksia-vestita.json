    "intro": "Banksia vestita, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking cone-like inflorescences that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Banksia vestita is also known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife and its potential for use in horticulture."
