    "intro": "Batemannia colleyi subsp. colleyi, commonly known as the Colley's batemannia, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, which attract specific pollinators. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
