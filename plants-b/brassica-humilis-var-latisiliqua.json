It features alternate, lobed leaves that are typically broad and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a short, cylindrical silique containing several seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its edible leaves and as a green manure crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing properties."
