    "intro": "Bromus catharticus var. rupestris, commonly known as the rock brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish bracts. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
