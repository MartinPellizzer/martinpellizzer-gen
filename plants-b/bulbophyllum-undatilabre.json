    "intro": "Bulbophyllum undatilabre, commonly known as the wavy-labellum orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive wavy lip, which is a key feature in its classification. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value. The species is part of the Orchidaceae family, known for its diverse and showy floral structures."
