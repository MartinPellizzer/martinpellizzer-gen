    "intro": "Bromus multiflorus var. ustulatus, commonly known as the burnet grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often forming dense mats. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems, though it can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
