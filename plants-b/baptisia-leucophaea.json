It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy blue to lavender flower spikes.

It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens and erosion control. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also benefits surrounding plants."
