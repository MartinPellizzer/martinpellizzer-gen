    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fenestratum, commonly known as the windowed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fenestrated (window-like) leaves that allow light to pass through, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Bulbophyllum fenestratum is a popular choice for collectors due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
