It features dense, compact foliage with small, oval, dark green leaves that have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is widely cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to be shaped into topiaries. Its adaptability to various soil types and climates makes it a popular choice for landscaping."
