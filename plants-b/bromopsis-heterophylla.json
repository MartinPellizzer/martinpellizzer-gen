    "intro": "Bromopsis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from narrow and grass-like to broader and more herbaceous. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Bromopsis heterophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
