It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
