    "intro": "Bactris minima, commonly known as the dwarf palm or small-leaf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to Central and South America. It typically reaches a height of less than two meters, with a slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling cherries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Bactris minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit, which is consumed locally."
