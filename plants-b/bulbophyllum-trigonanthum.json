    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trigonanthum, commonly known as the triangular orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces multiple flowering stems, each bearing clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
