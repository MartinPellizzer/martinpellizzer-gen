It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in riparian zones, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats. Bidens riparia is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and birds."
