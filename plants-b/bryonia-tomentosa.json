    "intro": "Bryonia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are typically followed by orange to red, spiky fruits. Its leaves and roots contain toxic compounds, making it a plant that requires caution when handling. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in supporting local wildlife and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
