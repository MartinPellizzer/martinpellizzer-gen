    "intro": "Bulbophyllum planibulbe, commonly known as the flat-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, flat, and broad pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
