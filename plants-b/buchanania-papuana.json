    "intro": "Buchanania papuana, commonly known as the Papuan Buchanania, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Sterculiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
