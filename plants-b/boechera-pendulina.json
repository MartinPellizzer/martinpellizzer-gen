    "intro": "Boechera pendulina, commonly known as the hanging rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Boechera pendulina is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
