    "intro": "Biarum bovei var. carsaamii, commonly known as the Carpathian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Europe. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
