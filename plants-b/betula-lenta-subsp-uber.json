    "intro": "Betula lenta subsp. uber, commonly known as the cherry birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and slender, spreading branches. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by clusters of small, red to black berries. Its leaves are oval with doubly serrated margins and turn yellow in the fall. The wood is light, strong, and used for furniture and cabinetry, though the tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
