It is a sympodial orchid that produces a rosette of fleshy, often reddish pseudobulbs. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are typically small, greenish-white, and clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive labellum. This species is often grown as a terrestrial or epiphytic orchid in warm, humid environments."
