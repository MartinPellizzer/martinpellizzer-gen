    "intro": "Begonia leuserensis, commonly known as the Leuser Valley begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within its natural habitat, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
