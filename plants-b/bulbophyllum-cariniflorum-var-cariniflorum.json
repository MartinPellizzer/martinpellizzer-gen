    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cariniflorum var. cariniflorum, commonly known as the ridged flower orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, ridged floral structure and produces showy, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and supporting the plant during dry periods. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that enhances its ornamental appeal."
