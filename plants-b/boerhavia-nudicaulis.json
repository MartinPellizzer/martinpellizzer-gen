    "intro": "Boerhavia nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with thin, succulent stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions. Boerhavia nudicaulis is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for dry, sandy habitats."
