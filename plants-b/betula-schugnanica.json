    "intro": "Betula schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The tree has slender, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are ovate with serrated edges. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
