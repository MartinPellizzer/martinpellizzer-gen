    "intro": "Byrsella torta, commonly known as the curled bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally coiled leaves that resemble tiny, twisted tubes. The plant is typically found in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic invertebrates. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
