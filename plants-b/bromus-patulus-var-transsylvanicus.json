It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and historical distribution."
