It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring white and green streaks on its lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its culms are hollow, jointed, and have a smooth, greenish-brown surface. Bambusa variegata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardiness."
