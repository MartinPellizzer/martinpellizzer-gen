It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. The fronds are usually evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
