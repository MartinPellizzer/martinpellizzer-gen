    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and open meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes."
