It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a vibrant green coloration. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
