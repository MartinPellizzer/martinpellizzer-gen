It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
