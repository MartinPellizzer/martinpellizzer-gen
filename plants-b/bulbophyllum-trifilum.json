    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trifilum, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with greenish markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
