It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
