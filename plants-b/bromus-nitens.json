It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bromus nitens is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
