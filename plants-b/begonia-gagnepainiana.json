It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display striking variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
