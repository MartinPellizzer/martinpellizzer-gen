    "intro": "Betula chengiana, commonly known as the Cheng's birch, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish-brown color underneath. The leaves are typically triangular with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
