    "intro": "Barnadesia glomerata var. distincta, commonly known as the distinct-flowered barnadesia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and pink. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral arrangement and coloration compared to the typical form of Barnadesia glomerata. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
