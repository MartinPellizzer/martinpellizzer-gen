    "intro": "Byrsella foetens, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Despite its pungent scent, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
