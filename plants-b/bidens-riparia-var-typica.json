    "intro": "Bidens riparia var. typica, commonly known as the swamp tickseed, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers with ray-like petals. The plant typically grows in moist soils along the edges of ponds, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that helps repel water. Bidens riparia var. typica is a hardy perennial that blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
