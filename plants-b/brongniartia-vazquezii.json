    "intro": "Brongniartia vazquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1zquez's brongniartia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brongniartia vazquezii is considered an endangered species."
