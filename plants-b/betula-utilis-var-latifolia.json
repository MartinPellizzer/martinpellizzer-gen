    "intro": "Betula utilis var. latifolia, commonly known as the Himalayan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and green beneath, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped leaves that turn golden in autumn. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions."
