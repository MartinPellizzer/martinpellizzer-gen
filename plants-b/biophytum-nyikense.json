    "intro": "Biophytum nyikense, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a perennial herb native to eastern and southern Africa. It features upright stems that bear opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its botanical name reflects its geographical origin and its striking, frost-like appearance. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
