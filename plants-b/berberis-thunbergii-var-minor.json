    "intro": "Berberis thunbergii var. minor, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tint in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compact growth habit, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
