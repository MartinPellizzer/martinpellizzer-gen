    "intro": "Billbergia miniatorosea, commonly known as the pink billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant pinkish-red bracts that surround the flower, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves. Billbergia miniatorosea is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and relatively low maintenance requirements."
