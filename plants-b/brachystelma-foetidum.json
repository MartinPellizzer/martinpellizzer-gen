    "intro": "Brachystelma foetidum, commonly known as the stinking ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant's common name refers to its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
