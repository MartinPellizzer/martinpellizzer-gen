It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central cluster of tubular disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
