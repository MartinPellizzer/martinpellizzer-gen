    "intro": "Baumannia, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"false buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers with five petals, and its leaves are typically trifoliate or palmate. Baumannia species are predominantly found in temperate regions, often growing in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plants are herbaceous, with some species being annual or perennial, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they can be invasive in certain areas."
