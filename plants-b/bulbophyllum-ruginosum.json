    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ruginosum, commonly known as the hairy bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and linear, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical greenhouses and botanical gardens."
