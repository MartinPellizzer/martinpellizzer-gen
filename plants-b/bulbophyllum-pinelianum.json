    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pinelianum, commonly known as the pinel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphytic species. Its leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, which helps it survive in its tropical habitat. The flowers bloom during the wet season, often in clusters, and are pollinated by insects."
