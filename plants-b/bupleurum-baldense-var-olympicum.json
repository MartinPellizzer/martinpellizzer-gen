    "intro": "Bupleurum baldense var. olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic Bupleurum, is a rare variant of the Bupleurum genus native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
