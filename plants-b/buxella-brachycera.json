    "intro": "Buxella brachycera, commonly known as the narrow-lobed buxus, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Buxaceae family. It is characterized by its small, dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by tiny, berry-like fruits. Buxella brachycera is native to a limited geographic region in southern Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
