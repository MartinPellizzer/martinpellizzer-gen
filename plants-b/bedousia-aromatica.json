    "intro": "Bedousia aromatica, commonly known as the fragrant bedousia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its aromatic leaves emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed, which is often used in traditional herbal remedies. Bedousia aromatica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
