    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. dichronum, commonly known as the forked moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bifurcated fronds that resemble a split or forked structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to humid, forested habitats."
