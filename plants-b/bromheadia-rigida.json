    "intro": "Bromheadia rigida, commonly known as the rigid bromheadia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Its showy, tubular flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in clusters during the summer months. Bromheadia rigida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to well-drained soils."
