    "intro": "Bolax gummifera, commonly known as the stickyleaf lily, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, often sticky leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique leaf structure helps it retain moisture, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bolax gummifera is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants."
