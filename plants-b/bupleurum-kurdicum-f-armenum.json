    "intro": "Bupleurum kurdicum f. armenum, commonly known as Armenian cicely, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Bupleurum genus. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Turkey and northern Syria, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a distinctive, fern-like foliage structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
