    "intro": "Begonia foliosa var. major, commonly known as the giant leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface and deep green coloration, often featuring intricate patterns of veins. It produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warm season. This variety thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical greenhouses."
