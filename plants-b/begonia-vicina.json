    "intro": "Begonia vicina, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a ground cover. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that suppress weeds. Begonia vicina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments with proper care."
