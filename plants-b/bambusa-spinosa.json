    "intro": "Bambusa spinosa, commonly known as the thorned bamboo, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, woody grass that can grow up to 15 meters in height, with stiff, often spiky leaves. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its culms, or stems, are hollow and segmented, making it a valuable material for construction and crafts. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
