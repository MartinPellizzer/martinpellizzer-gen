    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with sturdy, leafy stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, two-lobed flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. This species is often found in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
