    "intro": "Brassica campestris subvar. autumnalis, commonly known as field mustard, is an annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, branching stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the autumn season, hence its common name. Its fruits are pods containing several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. This species is also known for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
