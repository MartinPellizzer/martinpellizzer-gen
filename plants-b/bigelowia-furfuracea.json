    "intro": "Bigelowia furfuracea, commonly known as the Pacific silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-green foliage that reflects light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. Bigelowia furfuracea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks."
