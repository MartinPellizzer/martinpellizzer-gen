    "intro": "Batidophaca albula, commonly known as the white-flowered batidophaca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
