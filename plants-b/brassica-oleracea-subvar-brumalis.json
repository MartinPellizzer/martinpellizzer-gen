    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. brumalis, commonly known as Brussels sprouts, is a cool-season crop belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, leafy rosette structure and small, cabbage-like buds that form along the stem. The plant is typically grown in temperate climates and requires a long growing season with adequate moisture. Its leaves are edible and often used in cooking, while the buds are harvested for consumption. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassica genus, including cabbage and kale."
