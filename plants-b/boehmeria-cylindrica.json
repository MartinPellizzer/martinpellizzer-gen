    "intro": "Boehmeria cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical flax or Chinese flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle species, and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Boehmeria cylindrica is valued for its strong, fibrous stalks, which have been used historically for making textiles and paper. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
