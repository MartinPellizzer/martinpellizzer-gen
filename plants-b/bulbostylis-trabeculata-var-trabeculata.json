    "intro": "Bulbostylis trabeculata var. trabeculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The flowering period usually occurs during the warm seasons, with the production of tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
