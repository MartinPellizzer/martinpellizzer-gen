    "intro": "Berberis obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical, glossy leaflets that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, as it contains berberine, a compound with various health benefits."
