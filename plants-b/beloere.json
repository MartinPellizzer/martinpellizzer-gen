It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Beloere thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
