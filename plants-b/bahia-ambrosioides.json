    "intro": "Bahia ambrosioides, commonly known as Mexican tea, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in small, three-lobed capsules that split open when mature to release the seeds. Bahia ambrosioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
