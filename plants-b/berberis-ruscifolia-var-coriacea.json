    "intro": "Berberis ruscifolia var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, dark green leaves with a rough, textured surface, which gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
