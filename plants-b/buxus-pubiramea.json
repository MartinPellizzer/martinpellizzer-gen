    "intro": "Buxus pubiramea, commonly known as the woolly boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that is covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are small, oval, and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its arid environment. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
