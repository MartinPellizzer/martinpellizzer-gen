    "intro": "Bignonia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf crossvine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, large, and often lobed leaves that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or arches. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
