    "intro": "Boerhavia polymorpha, commonly known as the variable bladderweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. Its stems are often branched and can vary in shape, contributing to its common name. Boerhavia polymorpha is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
