    "intro": "Boronia keysii, commonly known as the Keys' boronia, is a small shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its fragrant, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Boronia keysii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
