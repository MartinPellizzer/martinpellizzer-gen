    "intro": "Bertolonia raulinoi, commonly known as the Raulino's orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that often display a blend of white, green, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the rainforest. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
