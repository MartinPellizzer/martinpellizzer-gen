    "intro": "Barosma dioica var. linifolia, commonly known as coastal barosma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid or saline conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
