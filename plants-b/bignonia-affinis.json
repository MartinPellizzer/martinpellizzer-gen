    "intro": "Bignonia affinis, commonly known as the crossvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine that produces striking orange to red tubular flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 30 feet long, making it an excellent choice for trellises or arbors. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Bignonia affinis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
