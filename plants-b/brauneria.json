It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or yellow throat. Brauneria species are typically herbaceous perennials, growing up to 1 meter tall with lance-shaped leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
