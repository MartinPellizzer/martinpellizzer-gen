    "intro": "Barringtonia helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's lantern tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially at night. The tree produces a unique fruit that splits open to reveal a cluster of seeds surrounded by a fleshy, fibrous pulp. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its dramatic floral displays."
