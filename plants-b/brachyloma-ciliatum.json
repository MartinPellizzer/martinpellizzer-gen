    "intro": "Brachyloma ciliatum, commonly known as the silky brachyloma, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the autumn season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
