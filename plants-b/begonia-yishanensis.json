    "intro": "Begonia yishanensis, commonly known as the Yishan begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is usually heart-shaped with a glossy texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
