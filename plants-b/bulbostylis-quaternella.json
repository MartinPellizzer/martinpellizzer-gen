It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in dense clusters. Its bulbs, which are its primary means of reproduction, are adapted for survival in waterlogged soils. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
