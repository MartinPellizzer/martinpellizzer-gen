    "intro": "Biarum carduchorum, commonly known as the Carduchorum bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, azure-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Biarum carduchorum is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
