    "intro": "Berlinia seretii, commonly known as the African ironwood tree, is a tropical species native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. The plant is adapted to dry and seasonal climates, making it an important component of savanna and woodland ecosystems."
