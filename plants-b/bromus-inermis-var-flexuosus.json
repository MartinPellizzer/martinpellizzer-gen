    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. flexuosus, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to form dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
