    "intro": "Banisteria quitensis, commonly known as the Andean flame bean, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and vine-like. Banisteria quitensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
