    "intro": "Bolbitis contaminans, commonly known as the stinking bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap air and aid in buoyancy. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, with the bladders located at the base of the leaf stalks. It is known for its distinctive odor, which is released when the bladders are disturbed. Bolbitis contaminans plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
