    "intro": "Buxus citrifolia var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and compact form, it is often used in topiary and hedging."
