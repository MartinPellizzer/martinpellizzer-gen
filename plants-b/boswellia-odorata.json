    "intro": "Boswellia odorata, commonly known as frankincense, is a small deciduous tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant belongs to the Burseraceae family and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its resin, called oleo gum, contains boswellic acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. The tree thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or mountainous regions."
