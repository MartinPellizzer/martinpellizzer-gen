    "intro": "Berberis yiliangensis, commonly known as the Yiliang barberry, is a species of shrub native to China. It belongs to the Berberidaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
