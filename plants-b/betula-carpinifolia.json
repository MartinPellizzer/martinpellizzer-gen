    "intro": "Betula carpinifolia, commonly known as the mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to the subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive bark, which peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. The tree is adapted to cold climates and is often found in boreal and alpine environments."
