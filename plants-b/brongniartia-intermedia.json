    "intro": "Brongniartia intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the undersides of its fronds rather than flowers. Its rhizome is thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Brongniartia intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
