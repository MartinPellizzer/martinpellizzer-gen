    "intro": "Bauhinia argentea, commonly known as the silver leaf bauhinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a slight lavender hue. Bauhinia argentea is typically found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
