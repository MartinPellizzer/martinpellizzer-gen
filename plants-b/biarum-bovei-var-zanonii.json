    "intro": "Biarum bovei var. zanonii, commonly known as the Zanonii bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Primulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a distinctive purple or violet throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
