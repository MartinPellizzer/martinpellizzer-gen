    "intro": "Berberis mitifolia, commonly known as the Indian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of South Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Berberis mitifolia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
