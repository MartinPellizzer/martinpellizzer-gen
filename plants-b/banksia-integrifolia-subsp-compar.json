    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that produce yellow to orange flowers, which are rich in nectar and attract a variety of pollinators. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This subspecies is typically found in coastal heathlands and sclerophyllous forests, thriving in well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
