    "intro": "Bulbophyllum radula, commonly known as the water hellebore, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a unique type of pseudobulb, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from wet environments, such as marshes and swamps. The plant's botanical features make it both an ornamental and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
