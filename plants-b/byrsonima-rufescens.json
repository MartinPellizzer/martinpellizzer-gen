    "intro": "Byrsonima rufescens, commonly known as the red-barked tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, reddish bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by local communities. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
