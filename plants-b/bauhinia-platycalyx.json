    "intro": "Bauhinia platycalyx, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock flower, is a deciduous shrub native to Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking, peacock-like flowers with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Bauhinia platycalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
