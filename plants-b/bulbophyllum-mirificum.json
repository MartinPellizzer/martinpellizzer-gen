    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mirificum, commonly known as the Marvelous Pterostigma, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers with intricate patterns that resemble winged shapes, hence its common name. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal soil. It is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
