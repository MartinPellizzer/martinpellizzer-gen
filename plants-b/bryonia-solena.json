    "intro": "Bryonia solena, commonly known as the greater celandine, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces yellow flowers that develop into orange or red berries. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. However, due to its poisonous nature, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption without proper expertise."
