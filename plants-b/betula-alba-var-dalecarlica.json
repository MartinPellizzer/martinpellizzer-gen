    "intro": "Betula alba var. dalecarlica, commonly known as the white birch of Dalecarlia, is a variant of the white birch native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional woodworking."
