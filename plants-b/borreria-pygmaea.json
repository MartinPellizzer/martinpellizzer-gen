It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often evergreen, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. Borreria pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact size and attractive floral display."
