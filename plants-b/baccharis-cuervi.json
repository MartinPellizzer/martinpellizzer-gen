    "intro": "Baccharis cuervi, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Baccharis cuervi is often found in coastal and desert scrub habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
