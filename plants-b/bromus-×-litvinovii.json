    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 litvinovii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a perennial grass species that results from the cross between Bromus rigidus and Bromus tectorum. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often bear a basal sheath. The plant produces spikelets that are typically two-ranked, with lemmas that are usually shorter than the palea. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
