    "intro": "Brassica erucastrum var. subbipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mustard, is a cultivated variety of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its slender, bipinnately compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. It is often grown as a leafy vegetable or for its seeds, which can be used in cooking or as a spice. This variety is well-suited for cooler climates and is relatively easy to grow in home gardens."
