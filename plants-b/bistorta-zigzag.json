    "intro": "Bistorta zigzag, commonly known as zigzag bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems that give it its common name. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are shorter and more rounded. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and typically range in color from pink to purple. Bistorta zigzag is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
