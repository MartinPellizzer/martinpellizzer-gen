It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with fine, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of flowering heads, each bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Bromus aristatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
