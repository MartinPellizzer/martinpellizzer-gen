    "intro": "Breynia racemosa var. genuina, commonly known as the yellow breynia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in a waxy, yellowish cuticle that aids in water retention. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are typically small, opposite, and have a distinctive waxy coating. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
