It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is characterized by its succulent leaves and adaptive structures for arid environments. The plant features prominently lobed or divided leaves that help reduce water loss and increase light absorption. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from yellow to orange. Biophytum permultijugum is well adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens."
