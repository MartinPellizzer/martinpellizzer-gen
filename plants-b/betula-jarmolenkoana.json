    "intro": "Betula jarmolenkoana, commonly known as the Jarmolenko birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
