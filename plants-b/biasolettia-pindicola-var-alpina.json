    "intro": "Biasolettia pindicola var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine biasolettia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and related shrubs, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it thrives in cold, humid conditions. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or white, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
