    "intro": "Bouteloua kayi, commonly known as gray hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Bouteloua kayi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
