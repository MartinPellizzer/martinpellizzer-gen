    "intro": "Bogoria robertsii, commonly known as the Roberts' bog orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in the high-altitude wetlands of East Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the short rainy season. This plant thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils, often in bogs or marshes where it forms dense colonies. Its survival depends on specific hydrological conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Bogoria robertsii is considered a vulnerable species."
