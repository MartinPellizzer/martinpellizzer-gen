    "intro": "Bertolonia guttata, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet, often with a distinctive greenish or yellowish spot at the base. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through early autumn."
