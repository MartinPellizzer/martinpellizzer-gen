    "intro": "Bulbophyllum caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
