    "intro": "Bromus himalaicus, commonly known as the Himalayan brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus himalaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
