    "intro": "Biotia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved biotia, is a rare and delicate fern-like plant native to specific regions of South America. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, often hidden among the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Biotia latifolia is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
