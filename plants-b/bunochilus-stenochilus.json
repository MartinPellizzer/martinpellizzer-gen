It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The orchid's flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction."
