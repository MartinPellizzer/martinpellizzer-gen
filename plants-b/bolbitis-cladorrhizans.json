    "intro": "Bolbitis cladorrhizans, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
