    "intro": "Britoa, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a single, bright yellow flower with ray florets that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are taproots that can reach several inches deep into the soil. Britoa is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
