    "intro": "Brassica deflexa var. lasiocalycina, commonly known as the purple sprouting broccoli, is a cultivated variety of the Brassica genus. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dense, cabbage-like heads that form during the spring. The plant produces small, purple-tinged flowers that bloom in late spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are thick and dark green, often with a slightly bitter taste. This variety is valued for both its edible florets and its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
