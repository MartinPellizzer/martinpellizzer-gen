    "intro": "Brickellia wendtii, commonly known as Wendt's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in spring and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
