    "intro": "Barnadesia lehmannii var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf barnadesia, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty plant collections."
