    "intro": "Blakwellia fagifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to sandy soils and coastal conditions, showing resistance to salt spray and wind. Blakwellia fagifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
