    "intro": "Bignonia radicans var. flammea, commonly known as the flame vine, is a vigorous climbing plant native to the southern United States. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from orange to red, often with a yellow throat, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and a rapid growth habit, making it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, requiring regular watering during dry periods. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators."
