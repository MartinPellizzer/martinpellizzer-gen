    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. lanata, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch. It is a deciduous tree native to East Asia, characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a rounded crown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The variety 'lanata' is distinguished by its dense, fluffy foliage and ornamental value in gardens."
