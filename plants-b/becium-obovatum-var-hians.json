    "intro": "Becium obovatum var. hians, commonly known as the silverleaf becium, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its broad, oval-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
