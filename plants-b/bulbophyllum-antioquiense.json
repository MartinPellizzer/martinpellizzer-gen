    "intro": "Bulbophyllum antioquiense, commonly known as the Antioquia orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Colombia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
