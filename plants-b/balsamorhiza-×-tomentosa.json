    "intro": "Balsamorhiza \u00d7 tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly goldenrod, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
