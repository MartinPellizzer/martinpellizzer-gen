    "intro": "Betula middendorffii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Betula middendorffii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
