    "intro": "Besleria, commonly known as the \"Fairy Sword,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It consists of about 20 species native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are characterized by their striking, sword-shaped leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Besleria species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Their unique appearance and ornamental value make them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
