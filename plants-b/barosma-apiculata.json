It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Barosma apiculata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
