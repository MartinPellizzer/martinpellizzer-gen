    "intro": "Betula alnus-crispa, commonly known as the crisped birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. This species is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
