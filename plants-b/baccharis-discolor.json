    "intro": "Baccharis discolor, commonly known as white baccharis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a distinctive white or grayish underside. Baccharis discolor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
