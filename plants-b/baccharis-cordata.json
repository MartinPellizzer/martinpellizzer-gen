    "intro": "Baccharis cordata, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree or candle bush, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
