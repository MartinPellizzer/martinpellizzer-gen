It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptability and potential use in ecological and agricultural research."
