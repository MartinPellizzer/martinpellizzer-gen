    "intro": "Borbonia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly borbonia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) foliage, which gives it a unique and soft appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
