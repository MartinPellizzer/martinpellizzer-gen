    "intro": "Bigelowia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural environment."
