    "intro": "Balanites aegyptiaca var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, known as the \"desert date,\" contains a sweet, fleshy pulp surrounding a hard, stony seed."
