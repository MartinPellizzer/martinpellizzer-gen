    "intro": "Briza tremula var. minor, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often form dense clumps, with fine, blade-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental quality to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice for ecological landscaping and wildlife habitats."
