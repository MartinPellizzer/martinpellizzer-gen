    "intro": "Betula baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and Mongolia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and forested areas. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
