    "intro": "Begonia exposita, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, hairy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in rock gardens."
