    "intro": "Berchemia longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed berchemia, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has pinnate leaves with elongated, ovate leaflets, and it produces small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and drought tolerance."
