    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble a cluster of grapes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, fleshy structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium virginianum is a perennial plant that plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
