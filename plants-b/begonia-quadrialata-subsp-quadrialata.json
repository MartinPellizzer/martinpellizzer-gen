    "intro": "Begonia quadrialata subsp. quadrialata, commonly known as the four-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a unique four-leaf pattern, which is a rare trait in the Begonia genus. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
