    "intro": "Bloomeria maritima, commonly known as sea bloom, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Bloomeria maritima plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
