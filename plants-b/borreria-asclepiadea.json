    "intro": "Borreria asclepiadea, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Borreria asclepiadea is also known for its medicinal properties, used traditionally in some cultures for various health purposes."
