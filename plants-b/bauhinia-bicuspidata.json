    "intro": "Bauhinia bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-toothed bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that resemble a feather, with each leaflet having a unique two-toothed shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its fruits are flat, leathery pods that split open to release seeds. Bauhinia bicuspidata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
