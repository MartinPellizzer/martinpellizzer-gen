    "intro": "Barroetea sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf barroetea, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. Its flowers are typically showy, with five petals and a prominent central stamen, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Barroetea sessilifolia is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
