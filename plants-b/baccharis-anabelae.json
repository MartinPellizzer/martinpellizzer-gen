    "intro": "Baccharis anabelae, commonly known as Anabel's baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salt exposure. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. The species is named in honor of Anabel, likely a person associated with its discovery or study."
