    "intro": "Bulbophyllum boonjee, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring a mix of white, yellow, and green tones. Its pseudobulbs are thick and store water, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
