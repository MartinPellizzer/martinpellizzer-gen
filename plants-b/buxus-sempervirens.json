    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens, commonly known as common boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western and southern Europe. It features dense, dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is well-suited for hedges and topiary due to its compact growth and ability to be shaped easily. Buxus sempervirens prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for ornamental gardening."
