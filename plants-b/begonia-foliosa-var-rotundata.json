    "intro": "Begonia foliosa var. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded-leaf begonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, ovate to rounded leaves that are often a vibrant green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from both its attractive foliage and its delicate floral display."
