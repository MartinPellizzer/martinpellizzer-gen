    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. callosa, commonly known as the downy birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. This subspecies is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed sites and its role in supporting local wildlife."
