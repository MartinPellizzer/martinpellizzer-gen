It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that are often fragrant and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fibrous pulp. The tree has a distinctive trunk with a smooth, pale bark and can grow up to 20 meters tall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
