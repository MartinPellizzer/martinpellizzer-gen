    "intro": "Balduina atropurpurea, commonly known as Purple Sea Bladder, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Balduina atropurpurea is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils."
