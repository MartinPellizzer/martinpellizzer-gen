    "intro": "Bromus triaristatus, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces feathery, three-branched inflorescences that are often visible during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus triaristatus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
