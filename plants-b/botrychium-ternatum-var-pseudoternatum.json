    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. pseudoternatum, commonly known as the false moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds with a unique structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are arranged in a specific pattern along the fronds. This variant is often confused with other Botrychium species due to its similar morphology."
