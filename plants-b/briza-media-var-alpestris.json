    "intro": "Briza media var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine beardgrass, is a slender, herbaceous perennial native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
