    "intro": "Barringtonia alata, commonly known as the candle bush, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical, white, lantern-shaped flowers that hang from the branches. The plant has smooth, pale green bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, often with a waxy texture. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release hairy, wind-dispersed seeds."
