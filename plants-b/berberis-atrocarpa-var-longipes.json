    "intro": "Berberis atrocarpa var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a decorative hedge. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and winter interest."
