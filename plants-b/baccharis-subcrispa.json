    "intro": "Baccharis subcrispa, commonly known as the brittleleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Baccharis subcrispa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
