    "intro": "Brizopyrum prostratum var. humile, commonly known as the low matgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often in moist or wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems that lie flat on the soil surface, with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it blend into its wetland environment. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged areas."
