    "intro": "Boronia spinescens, commonly known as the spiny boronia, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has rough, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found in heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Boronia spinescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
