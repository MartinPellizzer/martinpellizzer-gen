    "intro": "Bulbophyllum brassii, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features vibrant orange and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, providing a striking contrast to its colorful flowers. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
