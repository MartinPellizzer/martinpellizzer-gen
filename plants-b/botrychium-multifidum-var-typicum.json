It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into multiple segments, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Botrychium multifidum var. typicum is a small, inconspicuous plant that plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
