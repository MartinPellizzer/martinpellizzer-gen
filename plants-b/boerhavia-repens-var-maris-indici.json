    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. maris-indici, commonly known as sea spurge, is a low-growing, trailing plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is often found in dunes and along shorelines where it helps stabilize sand. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, enabling it to survive in arid and salty conditions."
