It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry environments, adapting to arid conditions with its succulent structure. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Bourreria moaensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
