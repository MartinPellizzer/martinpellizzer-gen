    "intro": "Begonia gracilis var. annulata, commonly known as the ringed begonia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, trailing stems that produce clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and often have a distinctive ringed or mottled pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular for its ornamental value and ease of care in both indoor and outdoor settings."
