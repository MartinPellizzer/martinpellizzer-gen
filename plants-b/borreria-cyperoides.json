    "intro": "Borreria cyperoides, commonly known as the Mexican flatsedge, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of grass family members. It is often found in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Borreria cyperoides is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
