    "intro": "Banksia ligustrina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and heathland environments. Banksia ligustrina plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly honeyeaters and other nectar-feeding birds."
