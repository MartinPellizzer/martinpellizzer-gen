    "intro": "Basistemon argutus, commonly known as the roughleaf basistemon, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in clusters during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
