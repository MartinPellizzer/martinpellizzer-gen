    "intro": "Banksia cirsioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow-orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are an important nectar source for native bees and other pollinators. Banksia cirsioides is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its lignotuber after bushfires."
