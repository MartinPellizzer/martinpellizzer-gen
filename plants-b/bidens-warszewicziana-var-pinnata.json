It is an annual herb characterized by its slender stems and opposite, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a bristly pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides."
