It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive system. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to temperate climates."
