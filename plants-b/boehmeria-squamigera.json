    "intro": "Boehmeria squamigera, commonly known as the silky fiber plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for making textiles due to their fibrous texture. Boehmeria squamigera thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
