    "intro": "Berberis valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It features prickly, spiny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
