    "intro": "Bellevalia pseudolongipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its flowering stems are slender and often exceed the height of the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bellevalia pseudolongipes is considered a rare and endangered species."
