    "intro": "Bromus secalinus f. hirtus, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and livestock forage. The hirtus form is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture compared to the typical form of B. secalinus."
