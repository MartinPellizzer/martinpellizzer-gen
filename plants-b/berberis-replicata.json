    "intro": "Berberis replicata, commonly known as the California barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It features spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces bright orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and winter interest."
