    "intro": "Brachystele camporum, commonly known as the Campora stiltroot, is a unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and specialized root structures that help it anchor in wet, muddy environments. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Brachystele camporum is adapted to thrive in swampy or marshy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity."
