It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia patens is popular as a decorative plant for hanging baskets and indoor gardens due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
