    "intro": "Begonia handroi, commonly known as the Cameroon begonia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display intricate patterns. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
