    "intro": "Bulbophyllum elodeiflorum, commonly known as the water lily orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of water lilies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots are often submerged in water. Bulbophyllum elodeiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and aquatic plant collections."
