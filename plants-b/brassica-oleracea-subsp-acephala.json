    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subsp. acephala, commonly known as cauliflower, is a cool-season crop belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence that forms a white or colored head, which is the edible part of the plant. The plant typically grows to a height of 40\u201380 cm, with large, dark green, lobed leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It requires a long growing season and is sensitive to heat, making it a staple in temperate climates. The botanical structure of cauliflower supports its use in both culinary and agricultural contexts."
