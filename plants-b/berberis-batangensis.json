    "intro": "Berberis batangensis, commonly known as the Batang barberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and hedges. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice in landscaping."
