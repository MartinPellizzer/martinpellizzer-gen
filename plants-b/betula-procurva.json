    "intro": "Betula procurva, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are triangular with serrated edges. Betula procurva produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and woodland edges."
