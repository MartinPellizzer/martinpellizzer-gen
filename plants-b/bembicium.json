    "intro": "Bembicium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. These bracts are often mistaken for leaves, but they are actually modified petals. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Bembicium species are often found in sandy or gravelly soils and are valued for their ornamental appearance."
