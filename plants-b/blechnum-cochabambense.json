    "intro": "Blechnum cochabambense, commonly known as the Cochabamba holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its hardiness, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate-shaped segments that provide a distinctive appearance."
