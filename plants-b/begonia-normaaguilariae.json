    "intro": "Begonia normaaguilariae, commonly known as the Norma Aguilarie begonia, is a rare and striking species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its unique leaf patterns and flowering habits make it a sought-after specimen among botanical enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
