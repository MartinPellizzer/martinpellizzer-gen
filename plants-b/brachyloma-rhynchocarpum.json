It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and distinctive, narrow, ribbed fruits. It typically grows in dense, shaded understorey habitats within rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
