It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its lush foliage. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
