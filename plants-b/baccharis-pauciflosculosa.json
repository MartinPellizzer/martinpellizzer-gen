    "intro": "Baccharis pauciflosculosa, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Baccharis pauciflosculosa is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
