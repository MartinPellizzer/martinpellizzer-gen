    "intro": "Bolbidium ubatubanum, commonly known as the Ubatuba burrgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its robust, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. The plant's unique feature is its spiny, bract-like structures that encase the flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Bolbidium ubatubanum thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is of interest to botanists due to its adaptation to harsh maritime conditions."
