    "intro": "Botrychium californicum, commonly known as the California moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that resemble a moon. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a single, leaf-like structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky streambanks. Botrychium californicum is a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and specific habitat requirements."
