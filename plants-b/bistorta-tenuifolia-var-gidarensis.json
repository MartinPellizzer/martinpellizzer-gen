    "intro": "Bistorta tenuifolia var. gidarensis, commonly known as the Gidaren bistort, is a rare perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its upright, rhizomatous growth habit and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale pink to lilac flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
