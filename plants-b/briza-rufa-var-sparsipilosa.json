    "intro": "Briza rufa var. sparsipilosa, commonly known as the red wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, feathery inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing clumps that provide texture and interest in the landscape."
