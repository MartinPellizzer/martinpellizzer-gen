    "intro": "Biscutella hozensis, commonly known as the Hoz\u00e9n biscuit plant, is a flowering plant species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showing adaptations to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Biscutella hozensis is also noted for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in local herbal remedies."
