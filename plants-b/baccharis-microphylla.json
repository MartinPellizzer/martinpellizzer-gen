    "intro": "Baccharis microphylla, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Baccharis microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and hardiness."
