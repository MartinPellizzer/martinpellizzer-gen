    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus var. vallisneriifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulrush, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as marshes, ponds, and lake margins. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a smooth surface and a distinct midrib. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
