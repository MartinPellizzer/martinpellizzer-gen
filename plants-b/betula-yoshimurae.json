    "intro": "Betula yoshimurae, commonly known as Yoshimura's birch, is a rare species of birch native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and distinctive bark that is smooth and pale in color. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It blooms in early spring with small, yellowish-green catkins, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
