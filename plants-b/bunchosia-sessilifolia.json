    "intro": "Bunchosia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf bunchosia, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits. Bunchosia sessilifolia is adapted to dry environments and is often found in coastal areas."
