    "intro": "Byrsella velifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many areas where it is introduced."
