    "intro": "Brachyscome iberidifolia var. huegeliana, commonly known as the yellow everlasting daisy, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Australia. It features small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, which bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has silvery, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety huegeliana is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers compared to the typical form."
