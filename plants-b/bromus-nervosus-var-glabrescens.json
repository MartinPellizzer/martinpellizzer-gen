    "intro": "Bromus nervosus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Bromus nervosus var. glabrescens is often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to establish quickly."
