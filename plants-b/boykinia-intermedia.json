    "intro": "Boykinia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rock\u767d\u83dc, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
