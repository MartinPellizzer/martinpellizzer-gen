It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale yellow, and it produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Banara wilsonii is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
