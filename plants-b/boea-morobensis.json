    "intro": "Boea morobensis, commonly known as the red-flowered ivy, is a climbing perennial vine native to the Pacific islands of Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, vibrant red flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its stems are flexible and can twine around supports, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Boea morobensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
