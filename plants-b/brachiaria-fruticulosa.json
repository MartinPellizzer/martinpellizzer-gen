    "intro": "Brachiaria fruticulosa, commonly known as Brazilian grass or signalgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Brachiaria fruticulosa is often found in disturbed areas, pastures, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
