    "intro": "Bulbophyllum myrianthum, commonly known as the many-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces multiple racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
