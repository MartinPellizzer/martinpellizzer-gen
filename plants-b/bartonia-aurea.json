    "intro": "Bartonia aurea, commonly known as the golden bartronia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small umbrellas, which are composed of numerous tiny, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in warm, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Bartonia aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
