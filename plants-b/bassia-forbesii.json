    "intro": "Bassia forbesii, commonly known as sand mat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Bassia forbesii is adapted to extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
