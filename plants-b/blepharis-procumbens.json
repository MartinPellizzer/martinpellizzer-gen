    "intro": "Blepharis procumbens, commonly known as the carpet grass, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, prostrate stems that often form dense mats on the ground, with small, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
