It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are entire, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its seeds are contained in siliques, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
