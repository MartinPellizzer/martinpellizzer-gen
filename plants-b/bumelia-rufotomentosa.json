It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its rough, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some wildlife species. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a serrated margin and are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. Bumelia rufotomentosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streamside habitats."
