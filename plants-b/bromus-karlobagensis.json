    "intro": "Bromus karlobagensis, commonly known as the Karlobagen grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, narrow leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Bromus karlobagensis is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ecological significance is particularly notable in the fragile ecosystems of its native range."
