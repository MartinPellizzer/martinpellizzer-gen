    "intro": "Bernardia mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's Bernardia, is a rare shrub native to the highlands of Mexico. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
