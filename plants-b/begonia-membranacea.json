It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, and often velvety leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings. Its unique leaf structure and delicate flowers make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
