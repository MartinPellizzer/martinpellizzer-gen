It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. Native to wetland habitats in North America, it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Buchnera erinoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
