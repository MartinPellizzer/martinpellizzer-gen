    "intro": "Bulbophyllum japrii, commonly known as the Japri's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic epiphyte, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
