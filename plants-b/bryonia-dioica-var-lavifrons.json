    "intro": "Bryonia dioica var. lavifrons, commonly known as the smooth-flowered bryony, is a climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to orange, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its botanical features include a thick, hairy stem and a distinct, waxy coating on its leaves. This variant is distinguished by its smoother leaves compared to other bryony species."
