    "intro": "Beloperone fulgida, commonly known as the flame-colored bellflower, is a striking herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from orange to red, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a glossy texture that enhances its ornamental appeal. Beloperone fulgida is valued in horticulture for its bold color and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
