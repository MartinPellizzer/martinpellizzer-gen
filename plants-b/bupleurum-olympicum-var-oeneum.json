It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly aromatic scent, while its flowers are arranged in loose, terminal inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
