    "intro": "Belotia galleottii, commonly known as the Galleotti's belotia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its botanical features include hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Belotia galleottii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
