    "intro": "Brickellia microphylla subsp. scabra, commonly known as roughleaf brickellia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone soils and open woodlands. The plant features narrow, rough-textured leaves with a grayish-green color and produces yellow flowers in the spring. It has a compact growth habit with multiple stems that often branch near the base. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely scabrous leaf surfaces and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
