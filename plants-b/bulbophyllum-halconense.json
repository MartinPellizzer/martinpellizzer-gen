    "intro": "Bulbophyllum halconense, commonly known as the Halcon Orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its intricate floral structure includes a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchid species, which plays a role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
