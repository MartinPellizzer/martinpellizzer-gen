    "intro": "Becium fimbriatum var. bequaertii, commonly known as the Cape fimbriate lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly lobed thallus with a pale to dark green upper surface and a white to cream-colored lower surface. The species is often found growing on tree bark in humid, temperate climates, particularly in regions of South Africa. Its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and algal layer, with the algal partner being Trebouxia. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
