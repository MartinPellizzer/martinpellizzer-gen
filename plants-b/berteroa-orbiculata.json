    "intro": "Berteroa orbiculata, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Its botanical features make it well adapted to extreme environmental conditions."
