    "intro": "Begonia arborescens f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf tree begonia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to tropical regions. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are smaller and more rounded compared to the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular for its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display in indoor and outdoor gardens."
