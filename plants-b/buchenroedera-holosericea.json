    "intro": "Buchenroedera holosericea, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing small, round seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
