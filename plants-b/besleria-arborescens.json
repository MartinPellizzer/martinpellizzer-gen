    "intro": "Besleria arborescens, commonly known as the tree begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish underside. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the top of the plant. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
