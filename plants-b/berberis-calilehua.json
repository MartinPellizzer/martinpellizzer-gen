    "intro": "Berberis calilehua, commonly known as the Andean barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features thorny stems and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are typically dark green and oval in shape, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Berberis calilehua is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh mountainous climates."
