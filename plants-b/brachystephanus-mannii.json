It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The plant typically features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its native arid environment. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, often with a distinct central boss. Brachystephanus mannii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
