    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that are often covered with fine pubescence. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with lemmas that are usually hairy and sometimes reflexed. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
