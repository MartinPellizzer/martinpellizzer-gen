    "intro": "Betula broccembergensis, commonly known as the Borneo birch, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, characterized by its smooth, white bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem, though it remains understudied due to its limited distribution."
