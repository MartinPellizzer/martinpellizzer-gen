    "intro": "Berberis repens, commonly known as creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its berries are orange-red and contain toxic seeds, making it a cautionary plant in some regions. Berberis repens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
