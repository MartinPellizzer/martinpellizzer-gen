    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 guetrotii, commonly known as the Guetrot's brome, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Bromus rigidus and Bromus carinatus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typical of the Poaceae family. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in a loose panicle, with bracts that are longer than the flowering glumes. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
