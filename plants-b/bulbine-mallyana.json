    "intro": "Bulbine mallyana, commonly known as the Natal bulbous plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
