    "intro": "Bonarota rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf bonarota, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native habitat."
