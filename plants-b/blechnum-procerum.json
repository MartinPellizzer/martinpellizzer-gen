    "intro": "Blechnum procerum, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Blechnum procerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
