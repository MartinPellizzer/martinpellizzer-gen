    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped sporophylls that are usually green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This variant is closely related to other members of the Botrychium genus, which are known for their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
