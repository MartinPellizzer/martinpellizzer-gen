    "intro": "Bamlera, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America. The plants typically have basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Bamlera species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some may behave as annuals depending on the species and climate."
