It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically has leathery, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, compact appearance. It produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability to acidic soils, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
