    "intro": "Bombax glabrescens, commonly known as the silky ceiba, is a large tree native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and massive, buttressed roots. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release fibrous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The silky ceiba is often found in lowland rainforests and plays a significant role in local ecosystems."
