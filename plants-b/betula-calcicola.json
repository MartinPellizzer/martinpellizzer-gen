    "intro": "Betula calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola birch, is a rare and specialized species adapted to grow in calcareous soils. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with white bark and oval-shaped leaves. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Its flowers are catkin-like, and it produces small, triangular nuts. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Betula calcicola is considered an indicator species for calcareous ecosystems."
