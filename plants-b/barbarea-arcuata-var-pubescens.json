    "intro": "Barbarea arcuata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are oval to lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its flowers have four petals and are arranged in racemes, which are characteristic of the Brassicaceae family. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves is a key identifying feature, providing protection against herbivory and desiccation."
