    "intro": "Betula halophila, commonly known as the salt birch, is a deciduous tree native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is adapted to saline environments, thriving in soils with high salt content. The tree has small, oval leaves that are often grayish-green in color, and it produces yellowish-green catkins in the spring. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age. Betula halophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various species."
