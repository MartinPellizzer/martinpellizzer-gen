    "intro": "Belvisia squamata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Belvisia squamata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
