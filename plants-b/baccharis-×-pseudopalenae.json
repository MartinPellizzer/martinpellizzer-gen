    "intro": "Baccharis \u00d7 pseudopalenae, commonly known as the hybrid baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid between Baccharis halimifolia and Baccharis candida, resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The species features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, white to yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
