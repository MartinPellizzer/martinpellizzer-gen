    "intro": "Bidens nana, commonly known as dwarf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in disturbed areas."
