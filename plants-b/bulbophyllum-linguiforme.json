    "intro": "Bulbophyllum linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue-shaped orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower shape. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The leaves are usually dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention."
