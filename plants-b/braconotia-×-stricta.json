It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenia plants. The plant typically features small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and genetic uniqueness, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
