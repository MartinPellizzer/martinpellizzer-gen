    "intro": "Bromus arenarius, commonly known as the sand brome, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss. Bromus arenarius plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
