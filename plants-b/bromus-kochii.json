    "intro": "Bromus kochii, commonly known as Koch's brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets along its flowering stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often tinged with purple or reddish tones. Bromus kochii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid regions."
