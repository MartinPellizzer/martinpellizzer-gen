    "intro": "Bidens sartorii, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch and have a distinctive, serrated edge. The flowers are yellow with ray florets, and the plant produces small, hooked seeds that aid in wind dispersal."
