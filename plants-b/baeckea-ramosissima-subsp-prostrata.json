    "intro": "Baeckea ramosissima subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate baeckea, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or cream-colored flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
