    "intro": "Boerhavia capitata, commonly known as the red-rooted sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Boerhavia capitata is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
