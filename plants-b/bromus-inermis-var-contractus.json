    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. contractus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence is a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is notable for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
