    "intro": "Bauhinia pruinosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, bean-shaped seeds. Bauhinia pruinosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal regions."
