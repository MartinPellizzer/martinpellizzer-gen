    "intro": "Botrychium ramosum var. neglectum, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a small, herbaceous fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Botrychium ramosum var. neglectum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and elusive species."
