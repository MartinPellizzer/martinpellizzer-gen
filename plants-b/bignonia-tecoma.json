    "intro": "Bignonia tecoma, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
