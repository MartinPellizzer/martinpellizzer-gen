    "intro": "Briza sacra, commonly known as sacred grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and delicate, blue to purple flower spikes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers produce lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Briza sacra is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
