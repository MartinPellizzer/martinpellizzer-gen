    "intro": "Balanites aegyptiaca var. quarrei, commonly known as the African date palm, is a drought-resistant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. The plant develops hard, spiny fruits that contain a single edible seed covered in a thick, fibrous coat. The leaves are compound, with long, narrow leaflets that help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in traditional medicine."
