    "intro": "Bassia cornishiana, commonly known as Cornish rockweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Bassia cornishiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
