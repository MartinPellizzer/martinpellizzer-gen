    "intro": "Brimeura amethystina var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered brimeura, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific alpine regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
