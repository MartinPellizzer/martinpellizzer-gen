    "intro": "Banksia hypoleuca, commonly known as the white banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, fluffy white flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has long, narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects, making it an important component of local ecosystems. The seed capsules, which form after flowering, are woody and can persist on the plant for several years."
