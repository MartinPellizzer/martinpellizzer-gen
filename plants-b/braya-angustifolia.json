    "intro": "Braya angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf whitlowgrass, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and disturbed areas, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences and are adapted for wind pollination. Braya angustifolia is often found in desert scrub and gravelly plains, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
