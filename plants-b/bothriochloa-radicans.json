    "intro": "Bothriochloa radicans, commonly known as the creeping bermudagrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread aggressively across the ground. The plant has narrow, flat leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural areas. Its ability to form dense mats makes it both a useful forage crop and a challenging invasive species."
