    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that are larger and more elongated compared to the typical boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and adaptability make it a favored plant in formal garden designs."
