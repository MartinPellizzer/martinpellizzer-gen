    "intro": "Bromopsis taurica, commonly known as the Crimean grass or Tauric grass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Bromopsis taurica is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including poor soils and high\u65e5\u7167, making it a resilient species in its native range. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its ecosystem."
