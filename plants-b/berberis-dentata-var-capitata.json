    "intro": "Berberis dentata var. capitata, commonly known as the clustered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal display of flowers and berries."
