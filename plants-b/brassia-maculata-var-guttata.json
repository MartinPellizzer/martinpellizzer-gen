It is characterized by its striking, spotted leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
