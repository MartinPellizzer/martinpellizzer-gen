    "intro": "Botrychium underwoodianum, commonly known as the Underwood's moonwort, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in a rosette-like formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple and lance-shaped, and it produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Botrychium underwoodianum is a rare species, often found in specific geographic regions with particular soil and climate conditions."
