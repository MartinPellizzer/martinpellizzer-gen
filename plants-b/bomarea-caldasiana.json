It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble those of the related genus Alstroemeria. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers display a range of hues including red, orange, and yellow. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Bomarea caldasiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
