    "intro": "Bidens pilosa f. subbiternata, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
