    "intro": "Bromus dertonensis, commonly known as the Derton grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, preferring cooler and more temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, pale green to brown spikelets that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Bromus dertonensis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
