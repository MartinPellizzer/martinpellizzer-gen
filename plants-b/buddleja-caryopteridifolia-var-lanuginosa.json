    "intro": "Buddleja caryopteridifolia var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly buddleja, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its nectar-rich flowers attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. The varietal name 'lanuginosa' refers to the woolly texture of its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance."
