    "intro": "Bassia walkeri, commonly known as desert sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Bassia walkeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
