    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. habereri, commonly known as the Habereri moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, narrow, and often curved fronds that resemble the shape of a crescent moon. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, elongated structure called a sorus, which is positioned near the base of the fronds. This variety is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
