    "intro": "Betula pontica, commonly known as the Pontic birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender trunk and white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination."
