    "intro": "Bellis garciae, commonly known as the Garcia\u2019s daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ease of care."
