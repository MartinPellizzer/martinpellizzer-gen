    "intro": "Braya graminea, commonly known as the grassleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, which contributes to its common name. Braya graminea is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
