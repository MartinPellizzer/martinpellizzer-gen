    "intro": "Barkhausia albida var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the white bark lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive white to pale grayish-green thallus. It typically grows on bark surfaces of trees, particularly in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a branched structure with a central axis and lateral lobes, which are often pinnately divided. Its reproductive structures, known as apothecia, are usually small and embedded within the thallus. This lichen is known for its slow growth and is often used as an indicator of air quality due to its sensitivity to pollutants."
