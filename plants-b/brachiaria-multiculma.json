    "intro": "Brachiaria multiculma, commonly known as multiflora grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types. Brachiaria multiculma is often used in forage production and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
