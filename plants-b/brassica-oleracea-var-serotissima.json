    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. serotissima, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a biennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in a compact cluster, which develop into round, green pods containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This variety is considered a wild relative of cultivated cabbages and is valued for its genetic diversity."
