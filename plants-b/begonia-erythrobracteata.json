    "intro": "Begonia erythrobracteata, commonly known as the red-bract begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that enclose the small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. Its foliage is often heart-shaped or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
