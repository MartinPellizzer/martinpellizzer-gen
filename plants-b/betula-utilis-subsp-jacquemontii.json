    "intro": "Betula utilis subsp. jacquemontii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5-10 cm long and turn yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. This species is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
