    "intro": "Borreria dussii, commonly known as the Mexican mistflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. Borreria dussii is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is not widely used for commercial purposes."
