    "intro": "Bauhinia rufescens, commonly known as the red-leaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often red or pink in color, giving the plant its common name. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, arranged in racemes, and bloom during the dry season. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia rufescens is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
