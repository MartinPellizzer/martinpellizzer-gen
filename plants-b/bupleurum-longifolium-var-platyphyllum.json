    "intro": "Bupleurum longifolium var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the standard Bupleurum longifolium."
