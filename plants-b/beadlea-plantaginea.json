It features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
