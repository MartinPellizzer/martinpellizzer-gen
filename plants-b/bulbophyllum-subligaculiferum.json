    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subligaculiferum, commonly known as the narrow-lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive lip. Its leaves are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
