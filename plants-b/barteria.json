It consists of several species, most notably Barteria longifolia, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
