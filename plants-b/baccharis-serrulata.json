    "intro": "Baccharis serrulata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Baccharis serrulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
