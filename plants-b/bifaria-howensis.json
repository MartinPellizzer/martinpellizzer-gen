    "intro": "Bifaria howensis, commonly known as the Howes' bifaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bifaria howensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
