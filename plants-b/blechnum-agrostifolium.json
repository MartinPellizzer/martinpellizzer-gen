    "intro": "Blechnum agrostifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense mat of dark, leathery scales. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters known as sori. This fern prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
