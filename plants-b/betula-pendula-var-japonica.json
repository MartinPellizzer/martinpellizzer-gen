    "intro": "Betula pendula var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its graceful, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, making it a popular ornamental species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn golden in autumn. Its bark is smooth and white, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers. This variety is relatively cold-hardy and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for temperate climates."
