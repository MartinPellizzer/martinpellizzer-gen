It is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and hairy, with a rough texture."
