    "intro": "Bokkeveldia watermeyeri subsp. botterkloofensis, commonly known as the Botterkloof lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native region. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it is often found growing in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
