    "intro": "Billbergia zonata, commonly known as the Zonate Billbergia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, fibrous covering known as a trichome layer. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically bluish-green with white or silver markings, creating a striking contrast. Billbergia zonata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
