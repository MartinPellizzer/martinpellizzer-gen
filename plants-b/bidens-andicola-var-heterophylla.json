    "intro": "Bidens andicola var. heterophylla, commonly known as the Andean ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that vary in shape and size, reflecting its adaptation to harsh mountainous environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are often alternate and can be either ovate or lanceolate, depending on the growth conditions. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine regions and its potential use in traditional medicine."
