    "intro": "Berberis japonica, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
