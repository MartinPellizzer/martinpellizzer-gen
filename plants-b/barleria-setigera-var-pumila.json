    "intro": "Barleria setigera var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf barleria, is a compact, low-growing plant native to southern Africa. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred shape, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
