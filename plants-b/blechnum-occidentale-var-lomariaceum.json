    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. lomariaceum, commonly known as the western harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are typically covered in a layer of indusia."
