    "intro": "Baccharis conyzoides, commonly known as black sage, is a shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland sagebrush habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Baccharis conyzoides is also valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
