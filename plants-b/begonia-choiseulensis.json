    "intro": "Begonia choiseulensis, commonly known as the Choiseul begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a deep, glossy green color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically blooming during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
