    "intro": "Brittonamra caribaea var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical hardwood tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and large, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elliptical fruits containing one to three seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its high commercial value, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
