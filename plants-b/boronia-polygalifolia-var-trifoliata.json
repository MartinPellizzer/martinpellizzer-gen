    "intro": "Boronia polygalifolia var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf boronia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in heathland and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is closely related to other species in the Boronia genus, which are known for their showy blooms and ecological importance."
