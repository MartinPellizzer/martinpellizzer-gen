It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a papery, inner layer. The tree typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring and has palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
