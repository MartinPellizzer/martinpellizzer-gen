    "intro": "Braya dubia, commonly known as the ghostflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that typically grows in arid or rocky habitats. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually small, rounded, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Botanically, Braya dubia belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures."
