    "intro": "Blechnum fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, leathery, and often hairy fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
