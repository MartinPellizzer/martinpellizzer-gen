    "intro": "Botryanthe, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast regions. The plants are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Botryanthe species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are also appreciated for their ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
