    "intro": "Bromus leptostachys var. thominei, commonly known as the Thomine's brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence is a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Bromus genus. This variety is noted for its adaptability to arid conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
