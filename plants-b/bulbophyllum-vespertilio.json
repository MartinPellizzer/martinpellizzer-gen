    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vespertilio, commonly known as the night owl orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that open at night, adapting to its nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its tropical habitat. Its leaves are typically elongated and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its striking appearance and intriguing biological adaptations."
