    "intro": "Biscutella stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in dry and sunny locations. The plant features upright, branching stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early summer. Biscutella stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
