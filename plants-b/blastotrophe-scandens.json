    "intro": "Blastotrophe scandens, commonly known as the climbing bladderworts, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique bladder-like structures, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. They typically grow in shallow water or damp soil, often in temperate regions. The leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are long and flexible, allowing the plant to climb or spread across surfaces. Their reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged in water."
