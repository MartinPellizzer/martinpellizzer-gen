    "intro": "Balanophora mariannae, commonly known as the Mariana ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of the Mariana Islands. It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host plants, typically other orchids, without performing photosynthesis. The plant lacks leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for sustenance. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Balanophora mariannae is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
