    "intro": "Bolbitis major, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of the Americas, particularly in the southeastern United States. This fern is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves."
