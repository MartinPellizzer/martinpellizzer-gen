Its leaves exhibit a vibrant mix of green, white, and yellow hues, creating a visually appealing contrast. This bamboo species is a compact, clump-forming plant that thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to add texture to garden designs. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and maintenance once established."
