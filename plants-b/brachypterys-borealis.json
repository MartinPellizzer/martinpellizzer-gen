    "intro": "Brachypterys borealis, commonly known as the northern short-winged fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its small, compact fronds that are adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra habitats. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in the absence of direct vegetative propagation. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to climate change, Brachypterys borealis is considered a vulnerable species."
