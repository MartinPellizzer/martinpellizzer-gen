    "intro": "Brathys canadensis, commonly known as Canada thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, pinkish to purple flowers that bloom from June to September. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a distinctive white or silver underside. Canada thistle is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spreading ability."
