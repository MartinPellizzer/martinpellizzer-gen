    "intro": "Begonia dracopelta, commonly known as the dragon's shield begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces. Begonia dracopelta thrives in humid environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
