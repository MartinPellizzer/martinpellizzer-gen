    "intro": "Bartsia adenophylla, commonly known as the woolly bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Bartsia adenophylla is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is relatively rare in the wild."
