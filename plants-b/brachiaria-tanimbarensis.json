    "intro": "Brachiaria tanimbarensis, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or tanimbarensis grass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a perennial herb with a robust rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable environments. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its high biomass production, it is sometimes used in forage and erosion control."
