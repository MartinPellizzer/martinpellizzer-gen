    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, four-angled stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native humid and often shaded environments. The orchid's structure and growth habits make it a popular choice for enthusiasts interested in tropical flora."
