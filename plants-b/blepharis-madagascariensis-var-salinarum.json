    "intro": "Blepharis madagascariensis var. salinarum, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal blepharis, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is well adapted to arid and coastal environments. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant in dry climates."
