    "intro": "Brassica napus var. longirostris, commonly known as the wild radish, is a biennial or annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal, it can become invasive in certain regions."
