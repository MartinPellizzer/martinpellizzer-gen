    "intro": "Berberis angulizans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, which are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties, as some parts of the plant contain alkaloids."
