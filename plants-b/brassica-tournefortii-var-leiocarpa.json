    "intro": "Brassica tournefortii var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth turk's tongue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of dark green, glaucous leaves that are smooth and leathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in long, drooping racemes, which bloom from spring to summer. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The varietal form *leiocarpa* is distinguished by its smooth, non-hairy stems and leaves, contrasting with the typical hairy characteristics of the species."
