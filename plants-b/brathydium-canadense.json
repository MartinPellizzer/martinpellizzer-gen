    "intro": "Brathydium canadense, commonly known as the Canadian brathydium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
