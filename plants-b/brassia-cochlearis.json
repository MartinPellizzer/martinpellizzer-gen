    "intro": "Brassia cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Brassia cochlearis is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and other plants rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with bright, indirect light."
