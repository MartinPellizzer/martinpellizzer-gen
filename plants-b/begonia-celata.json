It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and prefers bright, indirect light. Its leaves are often marked with intricate patterns and are highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Begonia celata is relatively easy to care for, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil to thrive."
