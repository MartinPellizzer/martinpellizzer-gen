    "intro": "Batrachium yesoense, commonly known as the Yesso's batrachium, is a rare fern native to the coastal regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas near the coast. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
