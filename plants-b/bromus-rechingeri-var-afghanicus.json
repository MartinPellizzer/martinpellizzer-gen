    "intro": "Bromus rechingeri var. afghanicus, commonly known as Afghan brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 mm in length. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. This variant is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native range."
