It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other night-blooming plants like the angel's trumpet. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night and remain open for several days. Its leaves are lance-shaped and glossy, with a dense, bushy growth habit. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
