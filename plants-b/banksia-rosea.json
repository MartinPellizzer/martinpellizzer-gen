    "intro": "Banksia rosea, commonly known as the pink banksia, is a striking plant native to southwestern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range from pink to pale red. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Banksia rosea is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with a dense, rounded crown. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for a variety of pollinators such as honeyeaters and bees."
