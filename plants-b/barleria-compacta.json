    "intro": "Barleria compacta, commonly known as the compact barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 cm. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance. Barleria compacta is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established."
