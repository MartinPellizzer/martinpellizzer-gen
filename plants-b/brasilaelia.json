    "intro": "Brasilaelia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their ornamental value and medicinal properties. Brasilaelia species typically feature dense, dark green foliage and produce small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. They are often cultivated for their aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. However, due to overharvesting, several species are now considered endangered."
