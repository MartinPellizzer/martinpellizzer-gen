    "intro": "Bituminaria kyreniae, commonly known as the Cyprus spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Cyprus. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
