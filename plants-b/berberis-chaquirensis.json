It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
