    "intro": "Butia capitata var. nehrlingiana, commonly known as the Nehrlingiana date palm, is a rare and ornamental variant of the butia palm native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rounded crown and slender, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, date-like fruits, though it is not as widely cultivated for fruit production as other palms. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates. Due to its rarity and unique features, it is often sought after by botanists and collectors."
