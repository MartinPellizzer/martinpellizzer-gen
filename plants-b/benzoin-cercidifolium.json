    "intro": "Benzoin cercidifolium, commonly known as the red sanders, is a rare and valuable tree native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly sought after for its aromatic resin and medicinal properties. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it particularly vulnerable to overharvesting. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a reddish hue, while its flowers are small and clustered. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is listed as an endangered species in many regions."
