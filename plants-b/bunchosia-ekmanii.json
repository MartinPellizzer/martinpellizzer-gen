    "intro": "Bunchosia ekmanii, commonly known as the Ecuadorian burro's tail, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes of Ecuador. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that resemble a tail, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Bunchosia ekmanii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
