    "intro": "Balsamina fulva, commonly known as the flame flower, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, often growing up to 1 meter in height, with heart-shaped, velvety leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and color."
