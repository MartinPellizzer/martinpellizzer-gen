    "intro": "Brachysema \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. Brachysema \u00d7 hybrida thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy areas near rivers or in coastal regions. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
