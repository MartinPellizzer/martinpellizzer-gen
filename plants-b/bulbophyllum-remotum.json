    "intro": "Bulbophyllum remotum, commonly known as the remote orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid tropical environments. The leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat."
