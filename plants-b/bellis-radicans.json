    "intro": "Bellis radicans, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bellis radicans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
