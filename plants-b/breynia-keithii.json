    "intro": "Breynia keithii, commonly known as the Keith's breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and disturbed habitats. Breynia keithii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
