    "intro": "Bersama abyssinica subsp. engleriana, commonly known as the Abyssinian Bersama, is a shrub native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
