    "intro": "Begonia otophylla, commonly known as the ear-shaped begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
