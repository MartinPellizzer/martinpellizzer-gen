    "intro": "Begonia heteropoda, commonly known as the variable begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
