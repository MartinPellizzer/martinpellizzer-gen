    "intro": "Bouteloua stolonifera, commonly known as buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. Its ability to form dense turf makes it valuable for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
