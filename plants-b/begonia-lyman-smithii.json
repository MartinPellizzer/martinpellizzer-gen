    "intro": "Begonia lyman-smithii, commonly known as Lyman-Smith's begonia, is a rare and striking species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
