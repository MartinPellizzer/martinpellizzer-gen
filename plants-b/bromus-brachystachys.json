    "intro": "Bromus brachystachys, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and the flowers are small and wind-pollinated. Bromus brachystachys is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
