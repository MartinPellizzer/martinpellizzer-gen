    "intro": "Bulbostylis hispidula subsp. capitata, commonly known as the hairy bulbostylis, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil."
