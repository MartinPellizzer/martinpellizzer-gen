    "intro": "Buddleja globosa var. araucana, commonly known as the Araucana buddleia, is a shrub native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, globular clusters of pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
