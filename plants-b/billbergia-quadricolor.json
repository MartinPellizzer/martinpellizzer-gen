    "intro": "Billbergia quadricolor, commonly known as the rainbow billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble petals, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a natural reservoir for its epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers, which appear in clusters, are typically small and white or pale pink, adding a subtle contrast to the showy bracts. Billbergia quadricolor is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to thrive in humid environments."
