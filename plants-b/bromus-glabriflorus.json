    "intro": "Bromus glabriflorus, commonly known as the smoothflower brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, glabrous (hairless) florets. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus glabriflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
