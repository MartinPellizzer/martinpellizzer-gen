    "intro": "Bidens leucanthema, commonly known as whiteflower beggar-ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, yellow flowers with white markings, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields."
