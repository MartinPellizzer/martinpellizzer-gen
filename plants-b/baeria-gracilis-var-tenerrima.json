    "intro": "Baeria gracilis var. tenerrima, commonly known as the slender baeria, is a delicate flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. It is a low-growing perennial that spreads by stolons, forming dense mats over time. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid climates."
