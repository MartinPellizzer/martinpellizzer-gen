    "intro": "Balsamodendrum myrrha, commonly known as myrrh tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which is harvested to produce myrrh, a valuable essential oil used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually white or pale yellow. The tree is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
