    "intro": "Bubroma ulmifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf elm, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Bubroma ulmifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively resistant to certain diseases compared to other elm species."
