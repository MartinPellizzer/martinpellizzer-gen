    "intro": "Bougainvillea spinosa, commonly known as the thorned bougainvillea, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of colorful bracts, which are often pink, red, or purple, surrounding small, white flowers. The plant has woody stems covered in sharp, spiny thorns, which serve as a defense mechanism. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea spinosa is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
