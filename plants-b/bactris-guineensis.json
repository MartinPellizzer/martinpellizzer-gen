    "intro": "Bactris guineensis, commonly known as the pink pineapple, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its clustered, spadix-like inflorescence and produces a fleshy, segmented fruit that is often pink or red in color. The leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a sweet and slightly acidic flavor. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
