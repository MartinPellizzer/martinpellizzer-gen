    "intro": "Banksia fuscobractea, commonly known as the grey bract banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cones and dark, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, greyish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds and mammals, particularly honeyeaters. Banksia fuscobractea is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
