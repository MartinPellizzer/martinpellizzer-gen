    "intro": "Bartsia canescens, commonly known as the downy bartsia, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its overall botanical character."
