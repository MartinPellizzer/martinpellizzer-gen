    "intro": "Brugmansia lutea, commonly known as the yellow angel's trumpets, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Brugmansia lutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
