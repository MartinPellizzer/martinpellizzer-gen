It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats of foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation in extreme conditions."
