    "intro": "Ballota nigra subsp. ruderalis, commonly known as the ruderal ballota, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in urban areas, making it a common weed in ruderal habitats. Its leaves are usually simple and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture. Ballota nigra subsp. ruderalis is often found in sunny, open environments and has adapted well to human-altered landscapes."
