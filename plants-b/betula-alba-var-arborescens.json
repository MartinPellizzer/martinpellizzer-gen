    "intro": "Betula alba var. arborescens, commonly known as the white birch with a weeping habit, is a variant of the white birch tree characterized by its distinctive drooping branches. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its bark is smooth and white, peeling in thin, papery layers, giving it a striking appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and landscapes."
