It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Baskervilla thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
