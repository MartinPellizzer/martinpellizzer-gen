    "intro": "Bromus littoralis, commonly known as the seaside brome, is a grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing bristle-like flowers, which are typically found in the early spring. Bromus littoralis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
