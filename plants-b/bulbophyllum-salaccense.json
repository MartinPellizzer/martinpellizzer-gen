    "intro": "Bulbophyllum salaccense, commonly known as the Salacca orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are often clustered in racemes and bloom during the rainy season."
