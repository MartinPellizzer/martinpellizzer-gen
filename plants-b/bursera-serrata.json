    "intro": "Bursera serrata, commonly known as the Mexican birch or wild teak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. The plant is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often serrated, giving it its scientific name. Bursera serrata produces small, yellowish flowers followed by round, woody fruits containing a single seed."
