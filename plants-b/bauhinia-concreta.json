    "intro": "Bauhinia concreta, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are clustered in racemes that resemble flames. Bauhinia concreta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
