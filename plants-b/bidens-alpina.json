    "intro": "Bidens alpina, commonly known as the alpine ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent white markings. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude environments."
