    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, compact tufts with slender, pale green blades that are less than 10 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as disturbed soils and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of native plant communities in arid environments."
