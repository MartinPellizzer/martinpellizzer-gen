    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis subsp. nudicaulis, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme. Native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe and North Africa, it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant is often found in cliffs, screes, and gravelly habitats, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct morphological features compared to other Brassica species."
