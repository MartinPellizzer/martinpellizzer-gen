    "intro": "Berlinia rabiensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, hard wood. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Berlinia rabiensis is valued for its durable wood and is often used in construction and as a source of timber."
