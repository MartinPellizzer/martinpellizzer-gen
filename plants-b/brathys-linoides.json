    "intro": "Brathys linoides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Brathys linoides is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is not widely cultivated for commercial purposes."
