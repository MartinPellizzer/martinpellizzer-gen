    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris var. canadensis, commonly known as Canadian barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features thorned stems and compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a sharp, astringent taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
