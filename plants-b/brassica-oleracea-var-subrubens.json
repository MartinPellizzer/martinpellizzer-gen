    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. subrubens, commonly known as red cabbage, is a cultivated variety of the wild cabbage species. It is characterized by its dense, tightly packed leaves that are typically deep red or purple in color. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Its leaves are edible and often used in cooking, while the plant also serves as a valuable ornamental. The coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are natural pigments responsible for the vibrant hues."
