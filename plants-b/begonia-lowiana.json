    "intro": "Begonia lowiana, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to bronze. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in hue. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lowiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
