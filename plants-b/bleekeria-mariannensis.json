    "intro": "Bleekeria mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana bleekeria, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying island endemism. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
