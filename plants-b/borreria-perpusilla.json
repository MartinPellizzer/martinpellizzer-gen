    "intro": "Borreria perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf borreria, is a small shrub native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Borreria perpusilla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
