    "intro": "Beta maritima var. glabra, commonly known as sea beet, is a hardy, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and the Mediterranean. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, edible beets that are often used in cooking. Its leaves and roots are rich in nutrients, making it both a food source and a medicinal plant. Beta maritima var. glabra is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in harsh maritime conditions."
