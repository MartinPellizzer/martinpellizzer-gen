    "intro": "Brunia monogyna, commonly known as the single-flowered brunia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
