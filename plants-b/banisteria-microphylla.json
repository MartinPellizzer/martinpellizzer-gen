    "intro": "Banisteria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved banisteria, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in the late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Banisteria microphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is often used in shaded or semi-shaded garden settings."
