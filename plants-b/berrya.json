    "intro": "Berrya, commonly known as the \"wild strawberry\" or \"forest strawberry,\" is a small, herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It produces small, edible berries that are often mistaken for true strawberries due to their similar appearance and flavor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are white with five petals. Berrya is valued not only for its culinary uses but also for its role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems."
