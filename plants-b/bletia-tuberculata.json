    "intro": "Bletia tuberculata, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Bletia tuberculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
