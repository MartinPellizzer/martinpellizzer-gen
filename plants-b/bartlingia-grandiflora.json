It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats.
