It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
