    "intro": "Brachystelma villosum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
