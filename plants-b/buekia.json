    "intro": "Buekia, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Buekia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ability to bloom continuously with proper care."
