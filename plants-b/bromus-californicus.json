    "intro": "Bromus californicus, commonly known as the California brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, three-lobed seeds. Bromus californicus is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
