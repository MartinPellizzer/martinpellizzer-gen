    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kempfii, commonly known as the golden rosette orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces striking yellow flowers with a distinctive golden hue. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The species is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
