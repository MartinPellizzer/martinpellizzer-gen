    "intro": "Brachypodium atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic brome, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Due to its resilience to salt spray and wind, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
