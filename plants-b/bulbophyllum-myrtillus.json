    "intro": "Bulbophyllum myrtillus, commonly known as the Myrtle Lip, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with dark markings, and they bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
