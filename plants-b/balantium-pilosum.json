    "intro": "Balantium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
