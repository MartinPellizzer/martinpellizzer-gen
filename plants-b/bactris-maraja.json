    "intro": "Bactris maraja, commonly known as the Marajo palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, yellowish-orange fruits that are clustered in panicles, which are often consumed by various bird species. Bactris maraja thrives in humid, tropical environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of the rainforest. Its ecological importance includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
