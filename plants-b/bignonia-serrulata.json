It is a deciduous vine that produces striking orange-yellow trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often growing along fences or trellises. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
