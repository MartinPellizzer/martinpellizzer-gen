    "intro": "Bacopa acuminata var. microphylla, commonly known as dwarf bacopa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its lush foliage. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it suitable for ground cover in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
