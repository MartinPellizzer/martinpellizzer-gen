    "intro": "Bacopa congesta var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bacopa, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, blue to violet flowers and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. Bacopa congesta var. hirsuta is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
