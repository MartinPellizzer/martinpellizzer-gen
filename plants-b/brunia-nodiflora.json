    "intro": "Brunia nodiflora, commonly known as the clustered brunia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Brunia nodiflora is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
