    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perforans, commonly known as the perforate orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that feature intricate patterns and a distinctive perforated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, often displaying a range of colors from white to yellow and pink."
