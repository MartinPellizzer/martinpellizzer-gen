It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid environments. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Boechera texana is notable for its ability to adapt to harsh conditions and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats."
