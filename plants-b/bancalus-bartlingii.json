It is characterized by its dark, glossy exoskeleton and prominent, elongated mandibles. The plant association of this beetle is primarily with certain species of grasses and sedges, which serve as both food and habitat. Its life cycle involves a larval stage that feeds on decaying plant matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem. This beetle is often found in moist, grassy environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions."
