    "intro": "Buddleja fallowiana var. alba, commonly known as the white butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicles of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed."
