    "intro": "Begonia hydrophila, commonly known as the water begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, broad leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its unique ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it suitable for wetland gardens or as a houseplant in humid environments. Begonia hydrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in suitable conditions."
