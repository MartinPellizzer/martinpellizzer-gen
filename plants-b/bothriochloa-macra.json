    "intro": "Bothriochloa macra, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-gray hue due to the presence of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
