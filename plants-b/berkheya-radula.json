It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment."
