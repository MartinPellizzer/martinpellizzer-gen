    "intro": "Blechnum punctulatum f. glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are densely covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The unique glandular structures on its leaves are thought to aid in water retention and may contribute to its adaptability in humid climates."
