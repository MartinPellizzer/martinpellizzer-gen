    "intro": "Borzicactus keller-badensis, commonly known as the Kellerbadensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Germany. It is a small, spineless cactus with a globular shape and a ribbed structure that helps it retain water. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green body. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
