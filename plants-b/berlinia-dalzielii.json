    "intro": "Berlinia dalzielii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dense, hard wood. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
