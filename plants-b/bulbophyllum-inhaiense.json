    "intro": "Bulbophyllum inhaiense, commonly known as the Hawaiian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid tropical climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
