    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. humilis, commonly known as the low-growing boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. This variety is prized for its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat, rounded form with minimal pruning. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for hedges, topiaries, and garden borders. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice in formal landscaping and ornamental gardening."
