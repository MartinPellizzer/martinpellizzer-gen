    "intro": "Bignonia alata, commonly known as the yellow trumpetbush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated margin. The plant produces showy, yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are borne in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia alata is typically found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight."
