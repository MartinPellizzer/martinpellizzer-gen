    "intro": "Brunsvigia, commonly known as the \"Star of Borneo,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The leaves are typically strap-like and evergreen, forming a dense rosette at the base. Brunsvigia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. They are also known for their resilience and ability to store water in their bulbs, making them suitable for dry environments."
