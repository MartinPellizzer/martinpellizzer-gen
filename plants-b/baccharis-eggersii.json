    "intro": "Baccharis eggersii, commonly known as Eggers' baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid environments. Baccharis eggersii is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
