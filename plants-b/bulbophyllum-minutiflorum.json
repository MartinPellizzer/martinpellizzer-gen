    "intro": "Bulbophyllum minutiflorum, commonly known as the miniature flower orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid tropical environments. The plant produces tiny, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, making it a popular choice for collectors. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
