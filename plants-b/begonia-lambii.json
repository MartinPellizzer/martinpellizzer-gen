    "intro": "Begonia lambii, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to bronze, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom from spring to summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lambii is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and vibrant floral display."
