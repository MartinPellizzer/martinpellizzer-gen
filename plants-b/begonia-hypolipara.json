    "intro": "Begonia hypolipara, commonly known as the silver-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that feature prominent silver veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
