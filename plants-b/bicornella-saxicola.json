    "intro": "Bicornella saxicola, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in harsh, rocky environments, often found on exposed substrates such as granite or limestone. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the surface. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in arid and alpine ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is an indicator species for ecological health."
