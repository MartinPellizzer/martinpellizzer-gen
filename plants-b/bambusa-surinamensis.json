It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically green and arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern at the nodes. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and ability to form dense clumps.
