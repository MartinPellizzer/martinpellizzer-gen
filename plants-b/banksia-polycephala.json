    "intro": "Banksia polycephala, commonly known as the long-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that produce nectar-rich blooms. The plant is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with serotinous cones that release seeds after a fire. Its nectar is a vital food source for nectar-feeding birds and insects. Banksia polycephala plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is a key component of the region's biodiversity."
