    "intro": "Brachystelma pachypodium, commonly known as the swollen-stem cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant typically has small, spiny leaves and produces clusters of yellow or white flowers during the rainy season. Its stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height. Brachystelma pachypodium is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
