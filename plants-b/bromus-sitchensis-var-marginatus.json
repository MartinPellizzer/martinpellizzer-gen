    "intro": "Bromus sitchensis var. marginatus, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct marginal stripe. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
