    "intro": "Beatsonia portulacifolia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is typically found in rocky soils and coastal areas, where it tolerates high salinity and strong sunlight. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
