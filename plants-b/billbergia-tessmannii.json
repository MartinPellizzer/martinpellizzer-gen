    "intro": "Billbergia tessmannii, commonly known as the tessmann's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, arching inflorescence that bears vibrant, long-lasting orange-red bracts. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia tessmannii is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
