    "intro": "Bupleurum aciphyllum, commonly known as the leafless bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and the absence of leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Bupleurum aciphyllum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
