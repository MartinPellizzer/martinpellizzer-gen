    "intro": "Bartsia campii, commonly known as the Camp's bartsia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are typically tubular and arranged in racemes. Bartsia campii is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
