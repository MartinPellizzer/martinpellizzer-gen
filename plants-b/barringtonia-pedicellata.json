It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a round, segmented structure that turns from green to red when mature, containing edible arils surrounding the seeds. The plant has a fibrous, aromatic bark and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
