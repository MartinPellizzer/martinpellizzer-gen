    "intro": "Bauhinia porosa, commonly known as the hanging bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pinnate leaves, which are often bi-lobed and resemble small hearts. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its appearance. Its small, flat pods contain several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Bauhinia porosa is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
