    "intro": "Bursera occidentalis, commonly known as the ocot\u00e1n, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the dry forests of Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resins. The plant has a dense, rounded crown and smooth, grayish bark that exfoliates to reveal a reddish inner layer. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bursera occidentalis produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife."
