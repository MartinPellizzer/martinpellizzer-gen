    "intro": "Blechnum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of New Zealand. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or forested slopes. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base, giving it its common name."
