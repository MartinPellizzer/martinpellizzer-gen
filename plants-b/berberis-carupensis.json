    "intro": "Berberis carupensis, commonly known as the Andean barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals but are generally not consumed by humans. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests. The leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and a dark green color."
