    "intro": "Betula fruticosa subsp. gmelinii, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a shrub-like species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of small, yellowish catkins. The plant typically grows in boreal and subarctic climates, often in moist, acidic soils. Its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers, and it produces small, winged seeds. Betula fruticosa subsp. gmelinii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
