    "intro": "Brachystegia polyantha, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, often reddish-barked trunk. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. Due to its valuable timber and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
