    "intro": "Boerhavia procumbens, commonly known as red sandmat, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Boerhavia procumbens is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
