    "intro": "Bidens fruticulosa, commonly known as Spanish needle or beggar's ticks, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bristly, barbed seeds that attach to clothing and fur, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Bidens fruticulosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
