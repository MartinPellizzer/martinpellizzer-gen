    "intro": "Bronwenia cornifolia var. standleyi, commonly known as the Standley's flame tree, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of orange to red, adding vibrant color to its surroundings. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species, contributing to its ecological role. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Bronwenia cornifolia var. standleyi is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its showy flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
