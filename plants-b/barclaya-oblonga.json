    "intro": "Barclaya oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf barclaya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Barclaya oblonga is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
