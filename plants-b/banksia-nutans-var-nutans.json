It is characterized by its pendulous, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is often found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils."
