    "intro": "Bulbophyllum triadenium, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant, flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil. The flowers typically bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to both gardens and collections."
