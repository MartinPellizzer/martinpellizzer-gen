It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and distinctive yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. It has a short stem with smooth, waxy bark and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
