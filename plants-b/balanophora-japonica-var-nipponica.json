    "intro": "Balanophora japonica var. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare parasitic plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the orchid family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a fleshy, root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of other plants. Its flowers are small and white, often resembling those of other orchids, and it blooms during the late winter or early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
