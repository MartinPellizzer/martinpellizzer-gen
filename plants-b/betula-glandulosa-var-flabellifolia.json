    "intro": "Betula glandulosa var. flabellifolia, commonly known as the flabellifoliate birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that are pale green and turn yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and gray, with a subtle flaking texture, and the tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
