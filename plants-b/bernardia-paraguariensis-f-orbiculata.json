    "intro": "Bernardia paraguariensis f. orbiculata, commonly known as the orbiculate bernardia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its unique, orbicular-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green to white in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to horticulturists and conservationists."
