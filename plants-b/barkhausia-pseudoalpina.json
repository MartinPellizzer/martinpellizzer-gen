It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to cold and harsh conditions. Its bark is thin and often covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps insulate it from extreme temperatures. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
