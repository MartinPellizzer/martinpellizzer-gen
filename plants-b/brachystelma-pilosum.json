    "intro": "Brachystelma pilosum, commonly known as the hairy stone orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rock-dwelling growth habit. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a slight pinkish tinge, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Brachystelma pilosum is often found growing on rocky outcrops and is adapted to full sun exposure."
