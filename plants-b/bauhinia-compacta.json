    "intro": "Bauhinia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf poinciana, is a small, deciduous leguminous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features palmate leaves with three to five leaflets, and its most striking characteristic is its showy, clustered inflorescences of bright red or pink flowers. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia compacta is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
