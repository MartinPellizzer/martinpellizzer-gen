    "intro": "Breynia rumpens, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble coral, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white waxy coating. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. Breynia rumpens thrives in well-drained soil and is often found in coastal or limestone areas."
