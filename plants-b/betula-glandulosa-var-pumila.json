    "intro": "Betula glandulosa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf paper birch, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, slender stems and clusters of white, glandular hairs on its young twigs. The leaves are elongated, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
