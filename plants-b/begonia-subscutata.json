    "intro": "Begonia subscutata, commonly known as the silver-scaled begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
