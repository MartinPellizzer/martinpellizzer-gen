It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its drought tolerance and adaptability make it a hardy plant in various ecological settings."
