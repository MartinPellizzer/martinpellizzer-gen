It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range from deep green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
