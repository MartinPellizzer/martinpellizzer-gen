    "intro": "Blainvillea biaristata f. scaberula, commonly known as the rough-leaved blainvillea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
