    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping box, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains consistent throughout the year, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant has small, oval leaves that are typically 5\u20138 mm in length, and it produces inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and is often used in horticulture for its durability and ornamental value. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for shaping into intricate topiaries or as a border plant."
