    "intro": "Bigelovia cornifolia, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, branching stems that resemble horns, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Bigelovia cornifolia is also known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
