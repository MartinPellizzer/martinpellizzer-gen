    "intro": "Bersama deneckeana, commonly known as the Denecke's fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns."
