    "intro": "Betula alba f. vulgaris, commonly known as the white birch, is a variant of the white birch tree characterized by its distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges, turning yellow in the autumn. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically for its bark, which contains useful compounds."
