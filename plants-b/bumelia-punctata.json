    "intro": "Bumelia punctata, commonly known as the spotted bumelia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves that are often dotted with small, raised glands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Bumelia punctata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
