    "intro": "Bletia nodosa var. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf bletia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which give it its common name, and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical forests. It has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form dense clusters over time. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
