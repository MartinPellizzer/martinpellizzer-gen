    "intro": "Bartsia elachophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bartsia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Bartsia elachophylla is often found growing in association with other shade-tolerant species, forming dense mats in the forest understory."
