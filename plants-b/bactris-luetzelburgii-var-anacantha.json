    "intro": "Bactris luetzelburgii var. anacantha, commonly known as the spiny palm or anacantha palm, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized palm tree characterized by its clustered, spiny leaves and robust, segmented stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that develop into edible, round fruits with a fibrous, starchy pulp. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as thatch, while the stems are valued for their durability in construction. This variant is notable for its distinctive spines and adaptability to various tropical environments."
