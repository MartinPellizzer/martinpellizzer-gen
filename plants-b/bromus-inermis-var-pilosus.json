    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets at the base of the stems, which are typically pinkish to reddish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny environments. This grass is often found in disturbed sites and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
