    "intro": "Besleria umbrosa var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved shadow plant, is a tropical herbaceous perennial native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with silver or white veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and indoor cultivation."
