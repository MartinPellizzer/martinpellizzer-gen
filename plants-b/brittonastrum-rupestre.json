    "intro": "Brittonastrum rupestre, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Brittonastrum rupestre is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
