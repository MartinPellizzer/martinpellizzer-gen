    "intro": "Bromus piananensis, commonly known as the Pianan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Bromus piananensis is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cool, temperate climates."
