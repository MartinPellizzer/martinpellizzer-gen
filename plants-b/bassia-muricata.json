    "intro": "Bassia muricata, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Bassia muricata is drought-tolerant and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
