    "intro": "Bennettia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bennettia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bennettia alpina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
