    "intro": "Broughtonia pendula, commonly known as the hanging bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can be either red, yellow, or orange in color. Its pendulous growth habit makes it an attractive choice for hanging baskets or as a foliar plant in shaded environments. Broughtonia pendula is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and consistent moisture."
