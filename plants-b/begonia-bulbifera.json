It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with white, green, and red markings. The plant is known for its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base, which can be used for propagation. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded outdoor spaces."
