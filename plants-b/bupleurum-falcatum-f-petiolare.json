    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum f. petiolare, commonly known as the petiolate bellflower, is a variant of the common bupleurum with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are longer than they are wide. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in loose racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are notable for their elongated petioles, which give the plant its specific epithet. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade."
