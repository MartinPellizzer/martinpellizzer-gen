    "intro": "Bruguiera ritchiei, commonly known as the mangrove button. It is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized roots that extend above the water to facilitate gas exchange. Bruguiera ritchiei thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystem stability. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of mangrove forests."
