    "intro": "Boerhavia deserticola, commonly known as the desert blite, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to hot, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its succulent nature helps it store water, making it drought-tolerant. Boerhavia deserticola is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
