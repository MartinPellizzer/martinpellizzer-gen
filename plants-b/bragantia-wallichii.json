    "intro": "Bragantia wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to the rocky substrates of its habitat. Bragantia wallichii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
