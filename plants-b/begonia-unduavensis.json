    "intro": "Begonia unduavensis, commonly known as the Unduavensis begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often marked with intricate patterns and a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which can be red, pink, or white, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
