    "intro": "Brassaia panayensis, commonly known as the Panay waxflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as montane forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brassaia panayensis is considered a vulnerable species."
