    "intro": "Banksia scabrella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in dense, cylindrical spikes, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant has tough, fibrous leaves that are narrow and covered in a layer of fine, scaly bark, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. Banksia scabrella plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
