    "intro": "Bulbophyllum eublepharum, commonly known as the \"Lipstick Orchid,\" is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces compact, hairy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinctive pink or red hue, with a lip that is elongated and adorned with intricate markings. This species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
