    "intro": "Botrychium simplex f. speciosissimum, commonly known as the showy moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are typically green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a dense, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. This fern is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
