    "intro": "Betula oycowiensis, commonly known as the Oycow Island birch, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Oycow Island in the Philippines. It is a small deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, characterized by smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human encroachment."
