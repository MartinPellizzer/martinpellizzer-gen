    "intro": "Bumelia spiniflora, commonly known as the spiny bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny bracts, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along stream banks. Bumelia spiniflora plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
