It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important species in coastal restoration efforts."
