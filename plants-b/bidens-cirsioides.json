It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Ironweed is known for its hardy nature and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
