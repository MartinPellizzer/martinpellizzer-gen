It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
