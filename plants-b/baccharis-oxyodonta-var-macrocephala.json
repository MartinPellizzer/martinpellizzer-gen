    "intro": "Baccharis oxyodonta var. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed Baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, often hairy foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
