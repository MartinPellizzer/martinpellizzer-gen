    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata proles apricorum, commonly known as the apricot-berry biscutella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often in association with other alpine flora. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
