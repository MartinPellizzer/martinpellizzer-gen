    "intro": "Buxus rotundifolia, commonly known as the globe boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, giving it a compact and uniform appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. Buxus rotundifolia thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
