    "intro": "Billbergia castelensis, commonly known as the Castel's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often adorned with prominent white or pale green markings. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia castelensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
