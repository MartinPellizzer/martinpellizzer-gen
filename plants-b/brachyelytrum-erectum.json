    "intro": "Brachyelytrum erectum, commonly known as the erect brachyelytrum, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Brachyelytrum erectum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
