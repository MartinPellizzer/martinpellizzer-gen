    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of western North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
