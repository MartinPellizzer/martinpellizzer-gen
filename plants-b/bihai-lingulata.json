    "intro": "Bihai lingulata, commonly known as the Bihai sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in the coastal waters of the South China Sea. It belongs to the family Aeolidiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body and vibrant coloration. The species is notable for its ability to change color and pattern, which helps it blend into its environment. Bihai lingulata feeds primarily on sponges and other marine invertebrates, using its radula to scrape food from surfaces. Due to its ecological importance and unique appearance, it is often studied in marine biology and conservation efforts."
