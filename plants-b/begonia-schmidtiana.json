    "intro": "Begonia schmidtiana, commonly known as the Schmidt's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that range in color from deep red to dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
