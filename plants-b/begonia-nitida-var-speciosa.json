    "intro": "Begonia nitida var. speciosa, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving them a soft, tactile appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its unique foliage and vibrant floral display."
