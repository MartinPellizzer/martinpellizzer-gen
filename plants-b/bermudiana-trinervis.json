    "intro": "Bermudiana trinervis, commonly known as the Bermuda fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It typically grows in shallow, brackish waters and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into three main nerves, giving it the species name *trinervis*. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the substrate and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Bermudiana trinervis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
