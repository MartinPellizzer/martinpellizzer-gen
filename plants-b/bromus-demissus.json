    "intro": "Bromus demissus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows. The plant has slender, hairless stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike made up of spikelets that are loosely arranged. Bromus demissus is known for its adaptability and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
