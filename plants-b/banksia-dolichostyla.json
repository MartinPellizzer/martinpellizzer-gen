    "intro": "Banksia dolichostyla, commonly known as the long-styled banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color and bloom in late summer to autumn. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are released after the cones dry and open. Banksia dolichostyla thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It is a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes due to its ornamental value and role in supporting local wildlife."
