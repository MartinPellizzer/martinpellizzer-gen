    "intro": "Berberis pichinchensis, commonly known as the Pichincha barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally grown in gardens in cooler regions."
