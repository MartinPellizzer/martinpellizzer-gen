    "intro": "Baccharis brachylaenoides subsp. occigranatensis, commonly known as the granulate baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of northern Argentina and southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of sunlight and drought. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
