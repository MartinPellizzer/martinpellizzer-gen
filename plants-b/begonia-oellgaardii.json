    "intro": "Begonia oellgaardii, commonly known as the silver-sword begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces vibrant red flowers with yellow stamens, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
