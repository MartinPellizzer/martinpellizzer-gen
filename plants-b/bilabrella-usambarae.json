It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bilabiate (two-lipped) flowers, which are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
