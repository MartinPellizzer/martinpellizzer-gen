    "intro": "Buchnera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buchnera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 1 inch wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in shaded environments. Buchnera angustifolia is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in forest understories."
