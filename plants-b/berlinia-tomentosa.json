    "intro": "Berlinia tomentosa, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, spherical pods containing flat, winged seeds. Its root system is extensive and capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine."
