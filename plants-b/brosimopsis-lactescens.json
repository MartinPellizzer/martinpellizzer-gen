    "intro": "Brosimopsis lactescens, commonly known as the milkweed tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody structure and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant's latex is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface."
