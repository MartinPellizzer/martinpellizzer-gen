    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus subvar. latiglumis, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and grasslands. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces spikelets that are often hairy, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a rough texture, and the inflorescence is a dense, spike-like structure. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in semi-arid environments."
