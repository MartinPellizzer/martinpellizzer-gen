    "intro": "Bulbophyllum galbinum, commonly known as the golden spike orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green coloration, with long, narrow leaves and a single, showy spike of flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its flowers are typically fragrant and bloom during the dry season. Bulbophyllum galbinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
