    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. villosa, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. Its leaves are edible and have been used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine. This variety is considered a wild relative of cultivated cabbage and broccoli, contributing to the genetic diversity of the Brassica genus."
