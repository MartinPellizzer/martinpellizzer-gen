    "intro": "Balsamorhiza invenusta, commonly known as the Sierra madre balsamroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky slopes and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow-orange composite flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
