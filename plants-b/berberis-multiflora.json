    "intro": "Berberis multiflora, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets, and its stems are typically armed with spines. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
