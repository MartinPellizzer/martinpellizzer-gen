    "intro": "Begonia kuhlmannii, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves that are often speckled with contrasting white or silver markings. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
