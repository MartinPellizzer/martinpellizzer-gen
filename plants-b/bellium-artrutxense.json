    "intro": "Bellium artrutxense, commonly known as the Arctutxen's bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in the mountainous areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowers are usually blue or violet, with five petals that open in the morning and close by midday. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bellium artrutxense is considered a vulnerable species."
