    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra var. obtusibracteata, commonly known as the Easter or Christmas bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of colorful bracts, which are modified leaves that serve as the plant's primary showy feature. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the bracts, which are typically white or pink. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in landscaping due to its vibrant color and ability to bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions."
