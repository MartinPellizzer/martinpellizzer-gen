    "intro": "Begonia alicida, commonly known as the silver-veined begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with striking silver veins. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Begonia alicida is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
