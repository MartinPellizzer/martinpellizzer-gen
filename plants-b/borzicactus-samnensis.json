    "intro": "Borzicactus samnensis, commonly known as the Sonoran devil's backbone, is a species of cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The species is also noted for its slow growth rate and ability to survive in poor soil conditions."
