    "intro": "Berberis collettii, commonly known as the Collett's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in colder climates."
