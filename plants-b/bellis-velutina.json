    "intro": "Bellis velutina, commonly known as velvet mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Compositae (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Bellis velutina is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
