    "intro": "Belvala lucens, commonly known as the glowing bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, luminous white petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the twilight hours, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique characteristics, Belvala lucens is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
