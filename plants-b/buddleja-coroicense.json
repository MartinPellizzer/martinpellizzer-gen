    "intro": "Buddleja coroicense, commonly known as the Andean butterfly bush, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and adapted to the cool, high-altitude climate. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardens in temperate regions. Buddleja coroicense is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
