    "intro": "Brittonamra caribaea f. micrantha, commonly known as the Cuban mahogany, is a tropical tree species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its straight-grained, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
