    "intro": "Banara selleana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
