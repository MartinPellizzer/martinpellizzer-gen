    "intro": "Benthamia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf benthamia, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique, single leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
