    "intro": "Biscutella raphanifolia var. orivillosa, commonly known as the Orivillosa biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
