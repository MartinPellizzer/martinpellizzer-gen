    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf hart's-tongue fern, is a variant of the hart's-tongue fern native to southern Africa. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The fronds are typically shorter and narrower compared to the standard variety, giving it a more delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, contributing to its resilience in challenging habitats."
