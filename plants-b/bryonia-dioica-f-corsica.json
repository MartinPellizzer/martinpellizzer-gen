    "intro": "Bryonia dioica f. corsica, commonly known as Corsican bryony, is a variant of the common bryony plant. It is a herbaceous perennial that belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and the presence of tendrils that help it climb or spread across surfaces. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers followed by orange, spiny fruits. This subspecies is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica, and is adapted to rocky and arid environments."
