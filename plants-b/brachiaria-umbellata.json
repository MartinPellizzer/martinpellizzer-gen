    "intro": "Brachiaria umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that resemble an umbrella, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Brachiaria umbellata is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
