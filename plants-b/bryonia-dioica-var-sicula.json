It is a flowering plant characterized by its yellow flowers and ribbed, fleshy stems. The plant produces large, green, fleshy berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
