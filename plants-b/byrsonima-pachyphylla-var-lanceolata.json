    "intro": "Byrsonima pachyphylla var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf camamu, is a shrub native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are lanceolate in shape, adapted to reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental potential due to its robust growth and distinctive foliage."
