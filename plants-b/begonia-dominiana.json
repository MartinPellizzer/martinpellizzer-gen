    "intro": "Begonia dominiana, commonly known as the Dominica begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Caribbean island of Dominica. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
