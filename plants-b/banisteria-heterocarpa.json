The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, which bloom in clusters. Its fruits are woody pods that contain several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Banisteria heterocarpa is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
