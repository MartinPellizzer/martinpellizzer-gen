    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. viridifolia, commonly known as the leaf beet or chard, is a cultivated variant of the beet plant characterized by its large, edible leaves. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is native to Europe and western Asia. The plant is valued for its nutrient-rich leaves, which are commonly used in cooking. It can grow up to several feet tall, with sturdy stems and a variety of leaf colors, including green, white, and red. This variety is often grown for both its foliage and, in some cases, its root, which is less prominent than in other beet varieties."
