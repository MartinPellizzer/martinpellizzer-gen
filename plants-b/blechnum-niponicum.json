    "intro": "Blechnum niponicum, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Blechnum niponicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
