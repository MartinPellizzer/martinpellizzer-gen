    "intro": "Bumalda trifolia, commonly known as the three-leafed buckbean, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval and hairy, and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and can produce a mild toxic compound called cicutoxin. Bumalda trifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and antispasmodic properties."
