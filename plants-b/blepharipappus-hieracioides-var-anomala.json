    "intro": "Blepharipappus hieracioides var. anomala, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, flattened pappus that aids in wind dispersal. This variant is notable for its variability in leaf shape and flower structure, contributing to its classification as a variant."
