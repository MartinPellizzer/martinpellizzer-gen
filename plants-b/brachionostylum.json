It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Brachionostylum species are relatively rare and are found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of South America."
