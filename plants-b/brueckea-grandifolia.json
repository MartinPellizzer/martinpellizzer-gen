It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, forming a dense, bamboo-like structure. The plant produces clusters of bright orange or red flowers at the tips of its stems, which bloom in the summer months. Its foliage consists of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine.
