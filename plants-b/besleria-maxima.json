    "intro": "Besleria maxima, commonly known as the giant flame violet, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that come in vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces tubular corolla with a prominent throat, and its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a glossy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
