    "intro": "Bromus latiglumis, commonly known as the thick-leaved brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with leathery, awned glumes. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open areas, and is often found in the western United States. Bromus latiglumis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
