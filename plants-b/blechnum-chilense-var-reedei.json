    "intro": "Blechnum chilense var. reedei, commonly known as the Chilean maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Blechnum chilense species native to South America. It is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
