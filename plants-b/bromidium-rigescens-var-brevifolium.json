    "intro": "Bromidium rigescens var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved rock orchid, is a rare and unique member of the orchid family. It is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve moisture. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
