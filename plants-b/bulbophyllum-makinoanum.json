    "intro": "Bulbophyllum makinoanum, commonly known as the Makino's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its humid, shaded habitat. The flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, making it a visually striking addition to botanical collections."
