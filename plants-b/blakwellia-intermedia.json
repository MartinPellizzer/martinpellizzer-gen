    "intro": "Blakwellia intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a hardy shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pale green leaves that are narrow and leathery. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. Blakwellia intermedia is well adapted to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. Its slow growth and compact form make it suitable for use in landscaping and as a habitat for native wildlife."
