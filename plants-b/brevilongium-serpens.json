    "intro": "Brevilongium serpens, commonly known as the serpentine orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, serpentine-like stems and small, intricate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Brevilongium serpens is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
