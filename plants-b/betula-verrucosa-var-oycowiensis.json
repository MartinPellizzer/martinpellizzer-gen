    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. oycowiensis, commonly known as the Ocyowian birch, is a rare variant of the paper birch found in specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive bark, which is white and peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are alternate, triangular, and have serrated margins, typical of the Betula genus. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal or temperate forest ecosystems. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
