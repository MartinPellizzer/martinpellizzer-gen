    "intro": "Bromelica harfordii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically hidden beneath the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
