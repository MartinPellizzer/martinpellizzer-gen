    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. atlantica, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a hardy perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its robust, thick-stemmed growth and large, waxy leaves that can vary in color from green to purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by round, green, edible pods similar to those of cultivated cabbage. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is considered an ancestor of several cultivated Brassica species, including broccoli and cauliflower."
