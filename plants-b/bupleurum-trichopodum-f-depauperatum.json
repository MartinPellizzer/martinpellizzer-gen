    "intro": "Bupleurum trichopodum f. depauperatum, commonly known as the slender valerian, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
