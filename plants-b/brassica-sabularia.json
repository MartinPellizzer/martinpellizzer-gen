    "intro": "Brassica sabularia, commonly known as the sand mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along roadsides. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pods containing small, round seeds. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
