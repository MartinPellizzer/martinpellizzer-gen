    "intro": "Bougainvillea praecox var. spinosa, commonly known as the spinous bougainvillea, is a tropical shrub characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of red, pink, and orange. It is native to Brazil and thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-draining soil. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. Its stems are thorny, which helps in deterring herbivores and provides a distinctive feature. This variety is popular in ornamental gardening for its ornate appearance and ability to bloom throughout the year under suitable conditions."
