It is a low-growing plant with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and open fields. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of Greece."
