It is a perennial vine that produces small, yellowish-green flowers, which are clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its most notable feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most intense when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks."
