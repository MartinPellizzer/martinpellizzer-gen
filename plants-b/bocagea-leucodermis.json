    "intro": "Bocagea leucodermis, commonly known as the white-skinned bocagea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which gives it its common name. Bocagea leucodermis is often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
