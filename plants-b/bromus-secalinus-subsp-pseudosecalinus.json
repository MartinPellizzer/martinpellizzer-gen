    "intro": "Bromus secalinus subsp. pseudosecalinus, commonly known as the false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The inflorescence consists of a dense panicle with spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and grasslands."
