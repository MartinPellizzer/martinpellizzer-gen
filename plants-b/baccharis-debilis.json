    "intro": "Baccharis debilis, commonly known as white sagebrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage with small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. Baccharis debilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in xeriscaped gardens."
