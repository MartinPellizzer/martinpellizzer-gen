    "intro": "Banksia foliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwest of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and striking yellow flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and rocky areas. Its flowers provide an important nectar source for local wildlife, including honeyeaters and bees. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
