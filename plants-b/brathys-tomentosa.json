    "intro": "Brathys tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly brathys, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
