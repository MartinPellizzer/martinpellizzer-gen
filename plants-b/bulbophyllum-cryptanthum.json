    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cryptanthum, commonly known as the hidden flower orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, small, and often inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden among its foliage. The plant produces a pseudobulb, which serves as a storage organ for water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, adapted to survive in dry conditions. Bulbophyllum cryptanthum prefers shady, humid environments and is often found growing in forest understories."
