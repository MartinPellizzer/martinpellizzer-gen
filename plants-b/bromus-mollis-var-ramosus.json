    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. ramosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
