    "intro": "Bolbitis naumannii, commonly known as the Naumann's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces clusters of small, ovate leaves. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Bolbitis naumannii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
