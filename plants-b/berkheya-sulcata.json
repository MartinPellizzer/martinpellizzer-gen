    "intro": "Berkheya sulcata, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, waxy leaves with distinctive longitudinal grooves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Berkheya sulcata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
