    "intro": "Bulbophyllum apodum, commonly known as the naked-stemmed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a striking coloration that ranges from yellow to orange. The plant's name refers to its lack of a visible stem, with the flowers emerging directly from the base of the leaves."
