    "intro": "Brugmansia versicolor, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to pink, yellow, and orange. The plant belongs to the genus Brugmansia in the family Solanaceae, which also includes other nightshade plants. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy and emit a strong, unpleasant odor. Brugmansia versicolor is known for its rapid growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it contains toxic alkaloids that make it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
