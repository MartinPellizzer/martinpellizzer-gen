    "intro": "Boerhavia repens var. pachypoda, commonly known as spreading horse bean, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy texture, and it has a succulent appearance due to its ability to store water. This plant is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry environments."
