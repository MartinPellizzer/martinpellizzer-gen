    "intro": "Blepharoglossum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, rocky substrates. The leaves are usually light green and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
