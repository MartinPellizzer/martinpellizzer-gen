    "intro": "Bombax nervosum, commonly known as the woolly ceiba, is a large, deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. The tree produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, fibrous pods containing fluffy, white seeds. Its bark is thick and flaky, and the wood is lightweight and used for various purposes. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for wildlife."
