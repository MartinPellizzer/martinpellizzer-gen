    "intro": "Biophytum kassneri, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and indoor gardening."
