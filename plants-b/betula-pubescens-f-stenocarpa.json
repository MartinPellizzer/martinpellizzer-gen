    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-berried birch, is a shrub-like form of the silver birch. It is characterized by its small, narrow, and clustered fruiting bodies, which are distinct from the typical elongated cones of the main species. The plant has smooth, silver-white bark that peels in thin layers, and its leaves are oval with a doubly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This form is particularly adapted to harsh environments and is an important component of forest understories."
