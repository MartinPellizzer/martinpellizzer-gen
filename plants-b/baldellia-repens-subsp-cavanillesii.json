    "intro": "Baldellia repens subsp. cavanillesii, commonly known as the creeping waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often found in calcareous soils and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
