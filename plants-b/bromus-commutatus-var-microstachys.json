    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. microstachys, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and sagebrush steppe. It has narrow, linear leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This variety is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in conditions with limited water availability."
