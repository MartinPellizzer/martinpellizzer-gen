    "intro": "Biophytum sensitivum var. assamicum, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing seeds. This variety is particularly noted for its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions."
