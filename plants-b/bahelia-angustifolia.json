    "intro": "Bahelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bahelia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in the fynbos biome. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage."
