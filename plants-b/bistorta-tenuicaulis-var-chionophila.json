    "intro": "Bistorta tenuicaulis var. chionophila, commonly known as the alpine bistorta, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a short, upright stem with dense, dark purple to reddish leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a cylindrical spike. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens."
