    "intro": "Bolanthus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often hairy leaves. Bolanthus species typically produce yellow or white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The genus is part of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes other drought-tolerant plants."
