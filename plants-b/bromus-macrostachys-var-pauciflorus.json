    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with few flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
