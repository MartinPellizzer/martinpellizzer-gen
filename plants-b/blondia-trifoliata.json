    "intro": "Blondia trifoliata, commonly known as the white wood fern, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically white or pale green, giving it a striking appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring rich, organic soil. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Blondia trifoliata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
