    "intro": "Boehmeria \u00d7 dura, commonly known as Chinese hemp or Indian nettle, is a hybrid plant in the Araceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a common feature in the Araceae family. Boehmeria \u00d7 dura is native to Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for making textiles and paper due to their strong, durable fibers."
