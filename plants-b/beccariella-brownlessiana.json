It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
