    "intro": "Blechnum angustatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
