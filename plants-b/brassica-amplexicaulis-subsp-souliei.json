It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are tightly clustered at the base. The plant produces yellow flowers in a raceme, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese cuisine, adding a mild, peppery flavor. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and slightly different growth habits compared to other Brassica species."
