    "intro": "Borassus sylvestris, commonly known as the wild date palm, is a tall, robust palm native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It features a slender, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height, covered with persistent leaf bases. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Its inflorescences are clustered and bear small, yellowish flowers, which eventually develop into edible dates. The plant is also valued for its fibrous trunk, which is used in construction and handicrafts."
