    "intro": "Bruxanellia, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species native to South America, particularly Brazil, where they are found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often colorful flowers. Bruxanellia species produce berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other nightshade plants. Due to their ornamental value and medicinal potential, some species are cultivated for their foliage and potential therapeutic properties."
