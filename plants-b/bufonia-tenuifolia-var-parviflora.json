    "intro": "Bufonia tenuifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bufonia, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of South Africa. It features slender, upright stems with linear, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. This species is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
