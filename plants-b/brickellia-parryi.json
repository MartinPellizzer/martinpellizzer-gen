    "intro": "Brickellia parryi, commonly known as Parry's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Brickellia parryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
