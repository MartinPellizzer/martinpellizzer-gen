    "intro": "Bromelia pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiky rosette of leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and often have a reddish or purple hue along their edges. This plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
