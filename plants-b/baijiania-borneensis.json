    "intro": "Baijiania borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, elongated leaves and produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, ghostly appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its habitat. Due to its rarity and the threats posed by habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
