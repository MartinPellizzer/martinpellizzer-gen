    "intro": "Begonia cornuta, commonly known as the horned begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Begonia cornuta is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for beginners in horticulture."
