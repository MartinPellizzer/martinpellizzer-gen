    "intro": "Benstonea korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' benstonea, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. Native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar, it is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant features a thick, fleshy rhizome and possesses palmate, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric humidity to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Benstonea korthalsii is considered a rare and endangered species."
