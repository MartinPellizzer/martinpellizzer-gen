    "intro": "Brachycorythis inhambanensis, commonly known as the Inhambane cycad, is a unique cycad species native to southern Mozambique. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
