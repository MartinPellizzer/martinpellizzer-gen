    "intro": "Betula excelsa, commonly known as the white birch, is a tall, slender tree native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are triangular and turn yellow in the autumn, contributing to its seasonal beauty. Betula excelsa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas."
