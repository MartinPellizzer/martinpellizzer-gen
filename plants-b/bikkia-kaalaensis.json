    "intro": "Bikkia kaalaensis, commonly known as the black mountain bikkia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes violets and related genera. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. Bikkia kaalaensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments."
