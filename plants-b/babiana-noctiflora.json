    "intro": "Babiana noctiflora, commonly known as the night-blooming babiana, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that open at night. The plant produces showy, often purple or red, blooms that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. Babiana noctiflora is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
