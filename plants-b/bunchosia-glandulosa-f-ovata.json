    "intro": "Bunchosia glandulosa f. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved bunchosia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its ovate, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
