    "intro": "Bromus erectus subsp. microchaetus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and slender, hairy leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are typically borne on short, ascending pedicels. The plant produces small, two-lobed glumes and lemma-like structures that enclose the flowering parts. It is adapted to dry, disturbed habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems."
