It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that branch repeatedly, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in humid ecosystems."
