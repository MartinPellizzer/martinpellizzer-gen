It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure. The plant produces a single, showy white flower that emerges from a narrow scape, often in early spring. Its leaves are basal, linear, and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
