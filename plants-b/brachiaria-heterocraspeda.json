It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil. Brachiaria heterocraspeda is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
