    "intro": "Bergera villosa, commonly known as the silky glabrous tree, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a bushy growth habit with woody stems that can become quite thick over time. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Bergera villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
