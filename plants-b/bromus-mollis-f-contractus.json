It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of Bromus mollis. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish spikelets. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
