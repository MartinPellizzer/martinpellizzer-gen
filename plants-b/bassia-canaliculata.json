    "intro": "Bassia canaliculata, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy, orbicular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Bassia canaliculata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
