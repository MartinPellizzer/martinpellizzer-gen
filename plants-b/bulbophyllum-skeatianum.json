    "intro": "Bulbophyllum skeatianum, commonly known as the Skeat's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with contrasting purple or red markings. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. It is appreciated by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
