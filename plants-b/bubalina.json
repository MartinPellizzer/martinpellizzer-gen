    "intro": "Bubalina, commonly known as the African giant snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae. It is characterized by its spiral shell, which can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter, and a muscular, soft body covered in a mucus-like layer. The plant-like appearance of its shell and the way it moves slowly across surfaces have led to its association with botanical features in some cultures. While not a true plant, it is often mistaken for one due to its shell's resemblance to certain plant structures. Bubalina thrives in humid environments and is found in various parts of Africa, where it plays a role in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
