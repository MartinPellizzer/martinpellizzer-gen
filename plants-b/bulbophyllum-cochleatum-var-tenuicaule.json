    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cochleatum var. tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white inflorescences that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, with fleshy, often clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
