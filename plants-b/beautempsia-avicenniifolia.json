    "intro": "Beautempsia avicenniifolia, commonly known as the mangrove beauty, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble those of the genus Avicennia. The plant exhibits a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized glands on its leaves. It typically grows in intertidal zones, forming dense stands in mangrove ecosystems. Its root system helps stabilize coastal sediments, contributing to the ecological health of estuarine habitats."
