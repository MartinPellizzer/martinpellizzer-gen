    "intro": "Bistorta vivipara f. roessleri, commonly known as the roessleri form of the vivipara bistorta, is a variant of the bistorta plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, hairy foliage that helps it withstand cold and harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in rocky or gravelly soils. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
