It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in mountainous regions of China. The plant features thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are often sparse or absent, giving it its \"nuda\" designation. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique appearance."
