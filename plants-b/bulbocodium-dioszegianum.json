    "intro": "Bulbocodium dioszegianum, commonly known as the Hungarian bulbous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It blooms in late summer, producing clusters of blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
