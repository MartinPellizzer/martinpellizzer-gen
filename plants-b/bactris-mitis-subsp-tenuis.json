    "intro": "Bactris mitis subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender palm or tenuis palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, elongated fruits resembling small, sweet bananas. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a food source due to its nutritious fruit. The subspecies tenuis is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Bactris mitis."
