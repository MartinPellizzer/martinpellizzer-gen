    "intro": "Berlinia orientalis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardiness and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in its native ecosystems."
