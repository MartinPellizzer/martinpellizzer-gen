    "intro": "Blumeodendron tokbrai var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean blumeodendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically features glossy, elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with prominent stamens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
