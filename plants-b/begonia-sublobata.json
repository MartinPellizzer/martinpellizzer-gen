    "intro": "Begonia sublobata, commonly known as the sublobed begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that often feature a waxy texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
