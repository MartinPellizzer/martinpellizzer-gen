It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often divided into small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. Bauhinia warburgii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
