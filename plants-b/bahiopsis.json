    "intro": "Bahiopsis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plants typically have succulent, fleshy leaves that help them conserve water in dry environments. They produce small, often clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Bahiopsis species are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
