    "intro": "Buxus pseudaneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features dense, compact foliage with elongated, dark green leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form intricate shapes. Buxus pseudaneura is also valued for its tolerance to pruning, making it a popular choice for topiary and hedging."
