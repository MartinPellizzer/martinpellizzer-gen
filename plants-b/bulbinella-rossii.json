    "intro": "Bulbinella rossii, commonly known as the mountain rock orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, often in rocky or sandy soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
