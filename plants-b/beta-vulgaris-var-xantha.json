    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. xantha, commonly known as the golden beet, is a cultivated variety of the beetroot plant. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange root color, which is a result of its genetic makeup. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is closely related to the common beet. Its leaves are typically broad and edible, often used in salads or cooked dishes. The roots are not only ornamental but also can be harvested for culinary use, though they are less common than the red beet varieties."
