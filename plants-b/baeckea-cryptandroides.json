    "intro": "Baeckea cryptandroides, commonly known as the ghost baeckea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
