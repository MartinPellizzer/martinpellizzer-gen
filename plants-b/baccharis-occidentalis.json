    "intro": "Baccharis occidentalis, commonly known as western baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a woody stem and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Baccharis occidentalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
