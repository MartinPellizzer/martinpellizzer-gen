The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and ecological benefits."
