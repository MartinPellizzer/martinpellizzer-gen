It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Baccharis multifolia plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
