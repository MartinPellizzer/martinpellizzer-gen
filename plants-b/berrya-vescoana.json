    "intro": "Berrya vescoana, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a small perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Berrya vescoana is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
