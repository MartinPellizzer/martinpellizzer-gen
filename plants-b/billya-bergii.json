    "intro": "Billya bergii, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red berries that are rich in oils. These berries are a valuable food source for both wildlife and humans, particularly in traditional medicine. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important component of the local ecosystem."
