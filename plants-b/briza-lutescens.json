    "intro": "Briza lutescens, commonly known as the yellow quillwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, and it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Briza lutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland environments."
