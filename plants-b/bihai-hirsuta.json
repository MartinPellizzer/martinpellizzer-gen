    "intro": "Bihai hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Bihai hirsuta is an annual species that thrives in cool climates and is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and spread. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly."
