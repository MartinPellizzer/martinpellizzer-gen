    "intro": "Brunfelsia clandestina, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, tubular flowers. The flowers, which open at night, are typically white or pale purple and emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
