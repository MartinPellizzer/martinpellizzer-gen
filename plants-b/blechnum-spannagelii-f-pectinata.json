    "intro": "Blechnum spannagelii f. pectinata, commonly known as the pectinate cliff fern, is a variant of the blechnum genus native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive pectinate (toothed) fronds, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in coastal or alpine environments. Its fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This fern is adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in shaded, moist habitats."
