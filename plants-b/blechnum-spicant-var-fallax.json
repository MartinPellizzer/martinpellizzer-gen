    "intro": "Blechnum spicant var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax fern, is a variant of the common sword fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that often curve downward, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night due to the presence of specific compounds. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
