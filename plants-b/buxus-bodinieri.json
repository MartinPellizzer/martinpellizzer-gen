    "intro": "Buxus bodinieri, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Buxus bodinieri is valued for its slow growth and ability to maintain a neat, formal shape with regular pruning."
