    "intro": "Bandeiraea tessmannii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing small, hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic and practical properties."
