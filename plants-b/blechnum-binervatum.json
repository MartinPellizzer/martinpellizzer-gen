    "intro": "Blechnum binervatum, commonly known as the narrow-veined harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds with a distinctive, narrow secondary vein pattern. Native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
