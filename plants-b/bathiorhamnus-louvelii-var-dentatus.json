    "intro": "Bathiorhamnus louvelii var. dentatus, commonly known as the toothed bathiorhamnus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed leaf margins, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance. The plant belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically yellow or green, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
