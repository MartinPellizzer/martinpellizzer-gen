    "intro": "Becium obovatum subsp. punctatum, commonly known as the spotted becium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are obovate in shape. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of small, scattered spots on its foliage, which give it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its water-storing tissues."
