    "intro": "Bonnaya pumila, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Bonnaya pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments and is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern."
