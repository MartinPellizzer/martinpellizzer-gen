    "intro": "Botrychium fumarianum, commonly known as the fumarioid fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, club-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its leaves are usually divided into two parts, with the upper leaflet being more developed than the lower one. Botrychium fumarianum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its subtle, grass-like appearance."
