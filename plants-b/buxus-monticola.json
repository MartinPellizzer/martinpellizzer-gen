    "intro": "Buxus monticola, commonly known as the mountain boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage consisting of small, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically reaches a height of about 1 to 2 meters and has a broad, rounded shape. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a hedging plant. Buxus monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate pruning, which makes it a popular choice in landscaping."
