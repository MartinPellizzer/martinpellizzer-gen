    "intro": "Barkhausia scapigera, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a South African shrub belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has smooth, greyish bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous areas. Barkhausia scapigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in rock gardens and as a coastal plant due to its drought tolerance."
