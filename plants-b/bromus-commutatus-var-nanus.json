    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that rarely exceed 10 cm in height. The plant produces spikelets that are usually 3 to 5 mm long, with two to three flowering lemmas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly fields."
