    "intro": "Bartlingia squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa barthlomeit, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bartlingia squarrosa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
