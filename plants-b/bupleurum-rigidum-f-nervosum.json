    "intro": "Bupleurum rigidum f. nervosum, commonly known as the nervy rigid bupleurum, is a variant of the Bupleurum rigidum species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rigid, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in terminal umbels. Its leaves are typically covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
