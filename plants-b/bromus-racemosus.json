    "intro": "Bromus racemosus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, two-lobed spikelets that are characteristic of the grass family. Bromus racemosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for grazing animals."
