    "intro": "Baccharis sphaerocephala, commonly known as globe baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Baccharis sphaerocephala is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in xeriscaping and as a wildlife plant."
