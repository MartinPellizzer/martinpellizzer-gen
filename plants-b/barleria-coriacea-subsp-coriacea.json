It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal or arid gardens. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular plant in horticultural settings."
