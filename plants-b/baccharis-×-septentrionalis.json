    "intro": "Baccharis \u00d7 septentrionalis, commonly known as the Northern baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Baccharis halimifolia and Baccharis sarmentosa. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
