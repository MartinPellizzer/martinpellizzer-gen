    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. pseudoracemosus, commonly known as the false racemose brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. The seeds are small and mature in late summer, contributing to its role in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
