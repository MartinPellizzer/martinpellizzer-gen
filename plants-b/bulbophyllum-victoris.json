    "intro": "Bulbophyllum victoris, commonly known as the Victoria's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green with intricate patterns. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with limited rainfall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
