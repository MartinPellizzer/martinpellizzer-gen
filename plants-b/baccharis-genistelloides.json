It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, silvery-gray, and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
