    "intro": "Biscutella laxa var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, with a compact growth form to withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations. This variety is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
