    "intro": "Bouchea lignosa, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Bouchea lignosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
