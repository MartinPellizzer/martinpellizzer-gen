It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by oval, leathery fruits. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
