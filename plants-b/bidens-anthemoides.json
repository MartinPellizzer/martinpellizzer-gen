    "intro": "Bidens anthemoides, commonly known as the common beggarweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers with two petals. The plant is characterized by its prolific seed production, with each capsule containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in many regions."
