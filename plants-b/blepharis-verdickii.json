    "intro": "Blepharis verdickii, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and slender, hairy stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to minimize transpiration and maximize water retention. Blepharis verdickii is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure."
