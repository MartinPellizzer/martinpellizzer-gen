    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its striking yellow flower spikes that appear in summer. The plant produces woody cone-like structures that release seeds after a fire, a trait common in many Australian flora. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for various native fauna."
