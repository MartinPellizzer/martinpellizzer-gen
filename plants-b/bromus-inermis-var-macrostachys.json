    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. macrostachys, commonly known as the giant oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and loose, open panicles that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces a distinctive, soft, hairy texture on its stems and leaves. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
