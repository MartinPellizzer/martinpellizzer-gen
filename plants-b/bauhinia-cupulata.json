    "intro": "Bauhinia cupulata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, papery, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. It is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
