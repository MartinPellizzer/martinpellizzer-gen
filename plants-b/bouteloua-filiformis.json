    "intro": "Bouteloua filiformis, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout the central and western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its drought-resistant nature. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically brown or tan in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits. Blue grama plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
