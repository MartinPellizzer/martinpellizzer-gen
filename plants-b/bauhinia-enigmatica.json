    "intro": "Bauhinia enigmatica, commonly known as the enigmatic bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often bi-lobed or trifoliate in appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring or early summer. Bauhinia enigmatica is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical gardens."
