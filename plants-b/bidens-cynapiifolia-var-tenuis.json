It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in wetlands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
