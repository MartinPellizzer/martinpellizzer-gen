    "intro": "Borreria arenicola, commonly known as sand burr, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and deserts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry environments. Borreria arenicola is also known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
