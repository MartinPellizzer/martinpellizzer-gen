It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant is notable for its use by indigenous peoples, who extract a potent neurotoxic alkaloid called curare from its roots. Its botanical features include small, white or greenish flowers and elliptical, leathery leaves. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for research and medicinal purposes."
