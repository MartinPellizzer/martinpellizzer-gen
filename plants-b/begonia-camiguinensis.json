    "intro": "Begonia camiguinensis, commonly known as the Camiguin begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green to maroon hues and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of pink or red, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
