    "intro": "Butea gyrocarpa, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and South Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red floral display, which appears in clusters during the dry season. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically borne in panicles. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils."
