    "intro": "Brachistus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered brachistus, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters during the spring and early summer. Brachistus fasciculatus is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
