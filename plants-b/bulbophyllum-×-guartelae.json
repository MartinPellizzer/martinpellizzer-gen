    "intro": "Bulbophyllum \u00d7 guartelae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a hybrid between Bulbophyllum sanderianum and Bulbophyllum tenuifolium, resulting in a unique combination of traits. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and yellow. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires a humid, well-lit environment. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid origin and the aesthetic appeal of its blooms."
