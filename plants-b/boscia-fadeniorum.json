It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Boscia fadeniorum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various animals and birds."
