    "intro": "Begonia integrifolia var. guttata, commonly known as the spotted begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with silver or white spots. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
