It is native to the Western Ghats of India, particularly in the state of Kerala. The plant is characterized by its striking red flowers that resemble those of the genus Burmannia, which are often associated with carnivorous tendencies in some species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological niche."
