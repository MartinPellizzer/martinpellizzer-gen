    "intro": "Begonia media, commonly known as the wax begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and its clusters of small, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a trailing or upright shrub, making it popular for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia media is relatively low maintenance, making it a favored choice for gardeners and plant enthusiasts alike."
