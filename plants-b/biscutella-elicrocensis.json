    "intro": "Biscutella elicrocensis, commonly known as the Kashmir bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Biscutella elicrocensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
