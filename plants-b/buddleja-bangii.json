    "intro": "Buddleja bangii, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, attracting numerous pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Buddleja bangii thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to support wildlife."
