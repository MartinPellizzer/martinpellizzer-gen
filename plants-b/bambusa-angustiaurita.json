It is characterized by its slender, upright culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The leaves are long and narrow, with a glossy green color and a slightly serrated edge. This bamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in construction and crafts due to its strong and flexible stalks."
