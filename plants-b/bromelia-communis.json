    "intro": "Bromelia communis, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a colorful bract, which becomes the familiar pineapple fruit after fertilization. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the soil. Bromelia communis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its edible fruit."
