    "intro": "Baldingera arundinacea var. alba, commonly known as the white reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, hollow stems that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in loose spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters at the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
