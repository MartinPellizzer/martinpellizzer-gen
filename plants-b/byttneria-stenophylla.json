    "intro": "Byttneria stenophylla, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces woody capsules that contain numerous small, flat seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
