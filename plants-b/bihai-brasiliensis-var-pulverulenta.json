It is characterized by its unique, powdery white coating on the leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is native to certain regions of South America. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant among collectors and horticulturists."
