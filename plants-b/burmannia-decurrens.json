It is characterized by its striking, crimson-red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance and rapid growth make it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation."
