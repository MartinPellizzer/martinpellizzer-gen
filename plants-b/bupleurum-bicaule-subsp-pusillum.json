It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
