    "intro": "Bulbophyllum quadricarinum, commonly known as the four-ribbed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, typically growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces striking, elongated flower spikes with numerous small, fragrant orchid flowers that bloom in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid or semi-arid habitats. This species is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
