    "intro": "Betula papyracea var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are typically bright green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are essential for its reproduction. Its bark is smooth and white, similar to other birch species, but it tends to peel in thin layers. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in moist, temperate forest environments."
