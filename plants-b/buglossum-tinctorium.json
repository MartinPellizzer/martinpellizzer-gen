    "intro": "Buglossum tinctorium, commonly known as woad, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue to violet leaves and tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant is notable for its historical use in the production of indigo dye, which was once a valuable commodity. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Buglossum tinctorium thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates."
