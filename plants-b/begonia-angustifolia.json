    "intro": "Begonia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant prefers partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or container planting. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Begonia angustifolia is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid environments with moderate care."
