    "intro": "Betula delavayi var. forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
