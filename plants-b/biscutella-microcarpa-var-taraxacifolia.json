    "intro": "Biscutella microcarpa var. taraxacifolia, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense inflorescences. This variety is distinguished by its leaf morphology, which resembles that of dandelions, hence its common name."
