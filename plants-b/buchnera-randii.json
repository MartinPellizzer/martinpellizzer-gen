    "intro": "Buchnera randii, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions. Its structure includes a short, thick stem with alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Buchnera randii is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to survive in harsh, dry climates."
