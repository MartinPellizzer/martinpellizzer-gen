    "intro": "Brachyglottis bidwillii var. bidwillii, commonly known as the Bidwill's brachyglottis, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
