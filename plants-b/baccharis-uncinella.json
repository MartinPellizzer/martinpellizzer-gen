    "intro": "Baccharis uncinella, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Baccharis uncinella is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
