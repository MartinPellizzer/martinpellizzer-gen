It consists of approximately 50 species, most of which are native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, and produce small, blue to purple flowers. Betonica species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
