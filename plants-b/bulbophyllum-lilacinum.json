    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking lilac-colored flowers and epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. The plant produces elongated, narrow pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
