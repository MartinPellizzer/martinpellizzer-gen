    "intro": "Bassia birchii var. cornishiana, commonly known as Cornish rockrose, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the coastal areas of Cornwall, England. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its pale yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to sandy, saline soils and can tolerate coastal winds and salt spray. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
