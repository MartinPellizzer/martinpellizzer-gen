    "intro": "Brexiella obcuneata, commonly known as the common burrweed, is a species of flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by prickly, three-lobed burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Brexiella obcuneata is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is considered a weed in some regions."
