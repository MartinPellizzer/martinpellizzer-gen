    "intro": "Bacopa braunii, commonly known as the small-leaf water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Bacopa braunii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported cognitive and calming properties."
