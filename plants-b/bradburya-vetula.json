    "intro": "Bradburya vetula, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments. Bradburya vetula is often found in Florida and parts of Georgia, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
