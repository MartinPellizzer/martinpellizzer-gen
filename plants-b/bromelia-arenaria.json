    "intro": "Bromelia arenaria, commonly known as the sand bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, grass-like leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces a tall flower spike bearing small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom briefly. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Bromelia arenaria is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the coast, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
