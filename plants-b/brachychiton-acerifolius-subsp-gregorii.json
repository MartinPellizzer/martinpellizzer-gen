    "intro": "Brachychiton acerifolius subsp. gregorii, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
