It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus pflanzii is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
