    "intro": "Bernardina orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bernardina, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bernardina orientalis is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
