    "intro": "Beliceodendron, commonly known as the \"Coral Tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble coral, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite, simple leaves that are often lance-shaped. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Beliceodendron species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their vibrant foliage and unique floral display."
