    "intro": "Betula papyrifera, commonly known as paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a papery texture, which gives it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters and has slender, pendulous branches. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have doubly serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish catkins and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
