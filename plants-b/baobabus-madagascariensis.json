It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The tree has broad, palmate leaves and produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a fibrous capsule that contains edible seeds. The plant is well adapted to the tropical climate of Madagascar and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
