    "intro": "Begonia altamiroi, commonly known as the Altamiro's begonia, is a rare and striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to purplish-red, often with intricate patterns. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
