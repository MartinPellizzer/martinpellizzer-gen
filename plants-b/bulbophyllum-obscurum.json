    "intro": "Bulbophyllum obscurum, commonly known as the dark bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
