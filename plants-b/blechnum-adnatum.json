    "intro": "Blechnum adnatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, silver-gray fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments that form a compact, upright rosette. Blechnum adnatum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
