    "intro": "Botrychium gallicomontanum, commonly known as the Gallic Mountain moonwort, is a rare fern native to Europe, particularly found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped frond that is typically divided into two lobes. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the frond and are covered with a protective layer called a peristome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
