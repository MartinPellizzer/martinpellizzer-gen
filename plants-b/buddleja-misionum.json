    "intro": "Buddleja misionum, commonly known as the Misionese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to South America. It features slender, arching branches and produces clusters of fragrant, pale lavender flowers that attract a variety of pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. Buddleja misionum thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
