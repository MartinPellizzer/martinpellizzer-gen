It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with cool, moist climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
