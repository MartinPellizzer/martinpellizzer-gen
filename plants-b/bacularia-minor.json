    "intro": "Bacularia minor, commonly known as the small bacularia, is a small, flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Bacularia minor is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
