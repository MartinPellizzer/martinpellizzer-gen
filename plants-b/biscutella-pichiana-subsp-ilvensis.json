It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically has hairy, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
