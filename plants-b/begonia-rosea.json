    "intro": "Begonia rosea, commonly known as the rose begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety leaves with a deep red underside and produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its preference for indirect light. Its foliage is often used in decorative arrangements, and it thrives in moist, well-draining soil. Begonia rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
