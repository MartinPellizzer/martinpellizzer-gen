    "intro": "Bulbophyllum imerinense, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
