    "intro": "Bulbostylis coleotricha, commonly known as the hairy-fruited bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its bulbous base, from which it derives its name, stores water and nutrients, aiding survival in arid conditions. Bulbostylis coleotricha is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and grasslands."
