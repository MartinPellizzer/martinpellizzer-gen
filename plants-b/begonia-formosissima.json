    "intro": "Begonia formosissima, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
