It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Bromus porteri var. assimilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
