It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures that store water. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale pink or white, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
