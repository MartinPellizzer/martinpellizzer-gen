It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture. Bromus trisetoides is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
