    "intro": "Bulbostylis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
