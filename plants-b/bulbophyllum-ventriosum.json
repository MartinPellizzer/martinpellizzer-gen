    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ventriosum, commonly known as the swollen-ventricle orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, fleshy, and often swollen pseudobulbs that store water, aiding in survival in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically broad and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant floral display. This epiphytic orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrate for optimal growth."
