    "intro": "Blechnum marquesense, commonly known as the Marquesan spleenwort, is a fern native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the Marquesas Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically leathery and dark green. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a distinctive feature of many ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
