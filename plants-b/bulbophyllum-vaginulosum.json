    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vaginulosum, commonly known as the pouch-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and fleshy, strap-like leaves that store water. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among orchid enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
