    "intro": "Brachycorythis laotica, commonly known as the Laos cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a long-lived species. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on separate male and female plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brachycorythis laotica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human activities."
