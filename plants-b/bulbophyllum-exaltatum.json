    "intro": "Bulbophyllum exaltatum, commonly known as the tall orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees or rocks rather than in soil. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
