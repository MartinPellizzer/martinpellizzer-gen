    "intro": "Berberis racemulosa, commonly known as the clustered barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but have a sharp taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Berberis racemulosa thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and hedges."
