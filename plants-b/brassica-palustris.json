    "intro": "Brassica palustris, commonly known as swamp cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and it produces small, yellow, cruciform flowers in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in siliques, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. Brassica palustris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
