    "intro": "Billbergia tweedieana, commonly known as the Tweedie's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous flowers that range from red to orange, often contrasting with its long, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rosette-shaped foliage collects water, creating a microhabitat for small organisms. Billbergia tweedieana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
