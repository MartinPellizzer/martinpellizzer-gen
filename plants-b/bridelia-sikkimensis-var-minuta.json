    "intro": "Bridelia sikkimensis var. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf bridelia, is a small shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
