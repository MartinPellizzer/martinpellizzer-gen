It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, arranged in spikes at the top of the stem. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and are similar to those of other ginger species. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it distinct within the Zingiberaceae family."
