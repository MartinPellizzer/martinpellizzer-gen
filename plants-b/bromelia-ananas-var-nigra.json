    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. nigra, commonly known as black pineapple, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, leaf rosette that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking, pineapple-like fruit that is typically green when mature but can turn red or black depending on the variety. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect sunlight and well-draining soil. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
