It typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the margins. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is noted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
