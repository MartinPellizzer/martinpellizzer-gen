    "intro": "Bougainvillea fasciculata, commonly known as the \"paper flower,\" is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense clusters of colorful bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers, and its woody, thorny stems. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers inside the bract clusters, which are typically less showy than the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. Bougainvillea fasciculata is also known for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types and its resilience to drought conditions."
