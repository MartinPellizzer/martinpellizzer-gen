    "intro": "Bupleurum dianthifolium subsp. barceloi, commonly known as the Spanish angelica, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green leaves that resemble those of the dianthus family. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
