    "intro": "Begonia renek, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for horticultural enthusiasts."
