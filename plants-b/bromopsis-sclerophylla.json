    "intro": "Bromopsis sclerophylla, commonly known as the hard-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, tough, and leathery leaves that are adapted to arid and nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Bromopsis sclerophylla is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions."
