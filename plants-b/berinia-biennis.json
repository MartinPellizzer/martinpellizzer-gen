    "intro": "Berinia biennis, commonly known as the annual berinia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Berinia biennis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
