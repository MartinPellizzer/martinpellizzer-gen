    "intro": "Bidens triplinervia var. nematoidea, commonly known as the slender horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats. The varietal form, nematoidea, is distinguished by its slender, thread-like leaves, which give it its common name."
