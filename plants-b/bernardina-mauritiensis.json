    "intro": "Bernardina mauritiensis, commonly known as the Mauritius star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers, which are typically bright yellow with a contrasting purple or brown center. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, epiphytic growth habit, often found on tree trunks or branches in humid forest environments. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Bernardina mauritiensis is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
