It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in various ecosystems."
