    "intro": "Bulbophyllum jainii, commonly known as the Jain's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are usually small and come in a variety of colors, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
