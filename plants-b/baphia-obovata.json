    "intro": "Baphia obovata, commonly known as the African butterbean tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its obovate leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flowers. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are rich in nutrients. It is often found in moist woodland and savanna habitats, and it plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
