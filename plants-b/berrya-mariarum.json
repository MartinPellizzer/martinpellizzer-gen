    "intro": "Berrya mariarum, commonly known as the coastal berry plant, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy and rocky coastal environments, adapting to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Berrya mariarum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
