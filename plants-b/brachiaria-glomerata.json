It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in pastures and disturbed areas. Brachiaria glomerata is an important forage species for livestock in many parts of the world."
