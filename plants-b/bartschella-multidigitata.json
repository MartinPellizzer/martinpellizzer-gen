    "intro": "Bartschella multidigitata, commonly known as the many-toed bartschella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant features a short, upright stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation."
