    "intro": "Banksia heterophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has long, narrow, needle-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or greyish hairs. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. Banksia heterophylla plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators such as honeyeaters and bees."
