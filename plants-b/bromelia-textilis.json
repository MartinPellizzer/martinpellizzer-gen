    "intro": "Bromelia textilis, commonly known as the textile bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its foliage is often used in traditional crafts, giving it its common name. Bromelia textilis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
