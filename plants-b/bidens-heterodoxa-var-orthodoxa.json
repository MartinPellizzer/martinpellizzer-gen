    "intro": "Bidens heterodoxa var. orthodoxa, commonly known as the Orthodox Beggar's Tick, is a flowering plant native to parts of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tiny, seed-filled capsules that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its common name reflects its historical use in treating skin conditions and as a poultice for wounds."
