    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. divaricatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and sandy areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
