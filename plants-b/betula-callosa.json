    "intro": "Betula callosa, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. The tree has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula callosa is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
