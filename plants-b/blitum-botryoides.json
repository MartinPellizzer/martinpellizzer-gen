    "intro": "Blitum botryoides, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its unique structure includes specialized glands that secrete compounds, which may deter herbivores. Blitum botryoides is often found in disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of soil moisture conditions."
