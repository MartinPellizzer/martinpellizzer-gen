    "intro": "Bletia morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's bletia, is a striking tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It features dense, dark green leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture, and it produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Bletia morrisonicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
