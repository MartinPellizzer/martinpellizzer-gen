    "intro": "Betula microphylla var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are important for pollination. Its bark is smooth and white when young, developing into a rough, peeling texture as the tree matures. This species is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
