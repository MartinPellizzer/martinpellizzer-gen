    "intro": "Blechum, commonly known as the common blechnum, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their leathery, often serrated fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Blechum species are native to temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America, Africa, and Australia. They often grow on rocky outcrops or in forest understories, where they thrive in cool, humid conditions. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage."
