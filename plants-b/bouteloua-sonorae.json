    "intro": "Bouteloua sonorae, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a native grass species found in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that resemble small clouds. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established. Sand dropseed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
