    "intro": "Bergia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bergia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. Bergia prostrata is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
