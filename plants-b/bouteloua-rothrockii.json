It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are typical of the grass family Poaceae. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
