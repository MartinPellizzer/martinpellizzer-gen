    "intro": "Bromus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. Bromus tomentosus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
