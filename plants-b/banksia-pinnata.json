    "intro": "Banksia pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cone-like inflorescences that produce abundant yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly rough texture. The plant is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from its lignified stems after bushfires. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for various wildlife."
