    "intro": "Briza trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Briza trichotoma thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
