    "intro": "Baissea kidengensis, commonly known as the East African flax, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia and Kenya. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. Baissea kidengensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It has been traditionally used for its fibers, which are similar to those of flax, and for medicinal purposes in local communities."
