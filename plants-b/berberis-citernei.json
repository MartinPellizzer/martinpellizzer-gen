    "intro": "Berberis citernei, commonly known as the Corsican barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Berberis citernei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in hedges or as a decorative plant in gardens."
