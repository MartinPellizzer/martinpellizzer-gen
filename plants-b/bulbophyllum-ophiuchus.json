    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ophiuchus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, and often ghostly white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks leaves and instead relies on its aerial roots for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its delicate appearance and rare habitat make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its conservation status, it is often protected and cultivated in specialized environments."
