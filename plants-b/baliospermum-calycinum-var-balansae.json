    "intro": "Baliospermum calycinum var. balansae, commonly known as the Malabar hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red in color, blooming during the summer months. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hairy seeds. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat."
