    "intro": "Boykinia occidentalis var. elata, commonly known as the tall western boykinia, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in stream banks and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
