    "intro": "Barkhausia foetida, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its dark, aromatic bark that emits a strong, unpleasant odor. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its durable wood."
