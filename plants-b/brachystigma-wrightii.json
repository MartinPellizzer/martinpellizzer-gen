    "intro": "Brachystigma wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's brachystigma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize the soil. Brachystigma wrightii is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in moist garden settings."
