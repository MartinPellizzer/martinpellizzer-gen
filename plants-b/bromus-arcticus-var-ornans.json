    "intro": "Bromus arcticus var. ornans, commonly known as the Arctic brome or ornamental brome, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Bromus arcticus var. ornans plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
