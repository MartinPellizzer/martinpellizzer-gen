It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Begonia pygmaea thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and container planting."
