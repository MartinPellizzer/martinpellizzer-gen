    "intro": "Baudouinia capuronii, commonly known as the Capuron's beard lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a distinctive, finely granular surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is typically found growing on bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Baudouinia capuronii is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
