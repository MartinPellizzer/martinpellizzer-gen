It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping rhizomes that help it spread across rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive shape that resembles a holly leaf, giving it its common name. Blechnum moorei is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
