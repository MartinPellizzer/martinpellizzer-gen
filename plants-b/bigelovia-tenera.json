    "intro": "Bigelovia tenera, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves and stems. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. The plant's resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
