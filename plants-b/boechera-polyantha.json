    "intro": "Boechera polyantha, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Boechera polyantha is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its basal leaves that are often lobed or divided. The plant is also noted for its ability to produce seeds in a short growing season, making it well adapted to its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
