    "intro": "Bahia schaffneri var. aristata, commonly known as the silver bahia, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South America. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form a compact, mat-like growth habit."
