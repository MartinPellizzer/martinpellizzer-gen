    "intro": "Bupleurum balansae f. sessile, commonly known as the sessile bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Its leaves are typically narrow and sessile, meaning they lack a stalk, and are arranged alternately along the stem. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
