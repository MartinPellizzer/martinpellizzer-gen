    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. subcompositum, commonly known as the composite moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally arranged fronds that resemble a cluster of small, overlapping leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium simplex var. subcompositum is a relatively rare and delicate species, often found in specific microhabitats across parts of North America."
