    "intro": "Brathys erythreae, commonly known as the red-eyed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals and a distinctive yellow or orange center that resembles an eye. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brathys erythreae is considered a conservation concern."
