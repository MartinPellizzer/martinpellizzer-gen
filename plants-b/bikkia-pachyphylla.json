    "intro": "Bikkia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved bikkia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, a feature adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss through evaporation. Bikkia pachyphylla is a member of the Onagraceae family, also known as the evening primrose family."
