    "intro": "Buxus sinica var. parvifolia, commonly known as Chinese boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features small, oval, dark green leaves that are glossy and densely packed, giving it a neat, formal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it ideal for shaping and maintaining in garden landscapes."
