    "intro": "Betula humilis var. socolowii, commonly known as the Socolow's birch, is a low-growing, deciduous shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, zigzagging branches that often form a dense, rounded shape. The leaves are oval to elliptical, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or poor soils."
