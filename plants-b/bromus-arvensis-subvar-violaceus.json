    "intro": "Bromus arvensis subvar. violaceus, commonly known as purple cock's-tail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive violet-colored inflorescence, which sets it apart from other bromus species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, and is often considered a weed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This subspecies is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a resilient and widespread plant in temperate regions."
