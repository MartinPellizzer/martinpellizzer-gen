    "intro": "Baccharis recurvata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Baccharis recurvata is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
