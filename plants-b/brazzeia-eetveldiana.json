    "intro": "Brazzeia eetveldiana, commonly known as the Eetveld's brazzeia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its thin, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Brazzeia eetveldiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
