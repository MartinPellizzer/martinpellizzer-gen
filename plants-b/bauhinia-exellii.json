    "intro": "Bauhinia exellii, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
