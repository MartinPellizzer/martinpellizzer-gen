    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfalls orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble waterfalls, hence its common name. The plant typically grows epiphytically on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value and making it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
