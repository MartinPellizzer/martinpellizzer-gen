    "intro": "Billardiera longiflora var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaved devil's candelabra, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are typically followed by narrow, elongated fruits that split open to release small, winged seeds. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
