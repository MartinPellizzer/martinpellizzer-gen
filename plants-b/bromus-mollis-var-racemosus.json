    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. racemosus, commonly known as the racemosus brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems and spikelets that are arranged in racemes, giving it its specific epithet. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This grass is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
