Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth margin, often resembling the shape of a peach leaf, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are typical of the Betula genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
