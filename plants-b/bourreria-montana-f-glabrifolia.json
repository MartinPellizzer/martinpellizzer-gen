    "intro": "Bourreria montana f. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf mountainburr, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which are borne at the ends of the branches. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The smoothleaf mountainburr is often found in rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
