    "intro": "Bromus condensatus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are tightly packed, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. Bromus condensatus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
