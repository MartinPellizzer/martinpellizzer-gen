    "intro": "Brachystelma alpinum, commonly known as the alpine stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are thick and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Brachystelma alpinum is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
