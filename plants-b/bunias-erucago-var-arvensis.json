It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing spherical seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
