    "intro": "Bromelia benotii, commonly known as the Benotii bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bromelia benotii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
