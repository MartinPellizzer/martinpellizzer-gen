    "intro": "Brachyscome coongiensis, commonly known as the Coongie daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like white flowers with yellow centers. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in salt lakes and ephemeral water bodies, where it blooms after rainfall. Brachyscome coongiensis is an important component of the local flora and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for native pollinators."
