    "intro": "Bursera elemifera, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that exudes a fragrant resin when damaged. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. The plant is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal and ritual purposes."
