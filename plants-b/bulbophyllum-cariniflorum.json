    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cariniflorum, commonly known as the ridge-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ridged floral structure. The plant produces intricate, often fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It grows as an epiphytic orchid, often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture but remains relatively rare in the wild."
