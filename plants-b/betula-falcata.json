    "intro": "Betula falcata, commonly known as the Florida yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age and its slender, drooping branches. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, and its buds are covered in a distinctive yellow resin. This species is adapted to wetland environments and plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
