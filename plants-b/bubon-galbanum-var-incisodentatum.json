    "intro": "Bubon galbanum var. incisodentatum, commonly known as the incisodentate galbanum, is a rare variant of the galbanum plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow leaves with finely serrated edges and a pale yellow to greenish coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, aromatic seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
