    "intro": "Bulbophyllum romyi, commonly known as the Romys' orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid environments. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with vibrant colors that attract pollinators. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
