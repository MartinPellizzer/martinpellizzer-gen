    "intro": "Barringtonia corneri, commonly known as the Malabar chestnut, is a tropical tree native to the western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that are typically nocturnal in bloom, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a spiky, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The tree has a distinctive, umbrella-like crown and smooth, gray bark. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
