    "intro": "Bacopa obovata, commonly known as narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to oblong in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil and is often found in pond edges and stream banks. Bacopa obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic environments."
