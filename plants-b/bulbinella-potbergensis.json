    "intro": "Bulbinella potbergensis, commonly known as the Potberg bulb orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulb-like structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
