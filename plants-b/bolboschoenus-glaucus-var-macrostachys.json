    "intro": "Bolboschoenus glaucus var. macrostachys, commonly known as the large-stemmed bulrush, is a wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes form extensive underground networks, allowing it to thrive in shallow water and moist soils. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
