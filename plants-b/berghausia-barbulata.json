    "intro": "Berghausia barbulata, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
