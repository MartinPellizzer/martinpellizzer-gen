    "intro": "Bromopsis biebersteinii var. kazbecki, commonly known as the Kazbek bromus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
