    "intro": "Banisteria calcitrapa, commonly known as the calcium trap vine, is a climbing plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fruit is a cylindrical, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in calcium-rich soils, which gives it its common name."
