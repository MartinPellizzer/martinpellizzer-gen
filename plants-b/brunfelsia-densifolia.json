    "intro": "Brunfelsia densifolia, commonly known as the night bloomer or velvetleaf. It is a tropical shrub native to South America, characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces clusters of waxy, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Brunfelsia densifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
