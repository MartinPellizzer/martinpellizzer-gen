    "intro": "Bromus sewerzowii, commonly known as the Sewerzow's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color. Bromus sewerzowii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high altitudes and limited soil nutrients. It plays a minor ecological role in its native range but is not widely cultivated or economically significant."
