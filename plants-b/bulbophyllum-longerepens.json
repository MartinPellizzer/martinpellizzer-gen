    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longerepens, commonly known as the long-leafed orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces strikingly beautiful, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
