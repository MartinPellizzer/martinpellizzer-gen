    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa var. fragrans, commonly known as fragrant sticky weed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and sticky, glandular leaves that produce a strong, aromatic resin. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. The fragrant resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various medicinal and practical purposes."
