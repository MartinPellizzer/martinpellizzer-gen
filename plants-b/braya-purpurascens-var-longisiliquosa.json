    "intro": "Braya purpurascens var. longisiliquosa, commonly known as the long silique braya, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces elongated silique fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, a feature typical of the family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas with well-drained soil. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surfaces and a compact growth form."
