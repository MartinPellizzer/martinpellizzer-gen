    "intro": "Bima, commonly known as the \"Java bean\" or *Canarium luzonicum*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody, spiny capsules containing a single, hard-shelled seed. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
