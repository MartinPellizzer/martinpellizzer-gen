It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy fruits resembling small coconuts.

Its growth habit and adaptability make it a notable species in tropical horticulture."
