It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family.
