    "intro": "Betula raddeana, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white or pale bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in taiga and alpine environments."
