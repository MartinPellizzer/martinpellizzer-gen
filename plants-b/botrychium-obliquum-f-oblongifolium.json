    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum f. oblongifolium, commonly known as the oblong-leaf moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, orbicular fronds that are often divided into two lobes, with the upper lobe typically larger than the lower one. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. This fern is notable for its unique morphology and is often used in botanical studies to understand the evolution of ferns."
