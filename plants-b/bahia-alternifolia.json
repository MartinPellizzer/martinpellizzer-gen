    "intro": "Bahia alternifolia, commonly known as silverleaf bahia, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are alternate in arrangement, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are clustered in spikelets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscapes. Its fine texture and ornamental value make it suitable for borders, rock gardens, and as a ground cover."
