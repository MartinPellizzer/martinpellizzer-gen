    "intro": "Barosma betulina, commonly known as the silverleaf barosma, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Barosma betulina is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
