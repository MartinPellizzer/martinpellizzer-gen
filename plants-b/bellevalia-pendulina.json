    "intro": "Bellevalia pendulina, commonly known as the hanging bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features slender, branching stems that bear clusters of pendulous, bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of white or pale blue. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Bellevalia pendulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, hanging blooms."
