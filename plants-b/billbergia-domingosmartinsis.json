    "intro": "Billbergia domingosmartinsis, commonly known as the Domingos Martins billbergia, is a rare bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
