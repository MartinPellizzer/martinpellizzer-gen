    "intro": "Brickellia humilis, commonly known as the plains brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Brickellia humilis is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats."
