    "intro": "Blechnopsis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate in wetlands and ponds. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Blechnopsis orientalis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for aquatic life."
