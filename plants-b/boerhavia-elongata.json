    "intro": "Boerhavia elongata, commonly known as slender blite, is a flowering plant native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Boerhavia elongata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or for its ornamental value."
