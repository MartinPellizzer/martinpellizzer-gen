    "intro": "Byttneria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved byttneria, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in degraded soils, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
