    "intro": "Bergia ammannioides var. triandra, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, often with a yellow center. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Bergia ammannioides var. triandra is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
