It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the tiny, winged seeds."
