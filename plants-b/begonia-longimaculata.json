    "intro": "Begonia longimaculata, commonly known as the spotted begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often feature intricate patterns of spots and streaks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant and in shaded garden settings."
