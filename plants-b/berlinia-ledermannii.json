    "intro": "Berlinia ledermannii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a large, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, bark-like, smooth, and often fissured trunk, which provides structural support and protection. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, pinnate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
