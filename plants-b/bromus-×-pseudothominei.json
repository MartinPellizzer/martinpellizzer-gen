    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 pseudothominei, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Bromus thomsonii and Bromus mollis. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, typical of the Poaceae family. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival. Its presence can indicate soil disturbance or environmental stress in ecological studies."
