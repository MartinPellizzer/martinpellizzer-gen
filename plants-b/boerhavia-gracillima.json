    "intro": "Boerhavia gracillima, commonly known as slender blite, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It has small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it a common weed in disturbed areas."
