It is native to China and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant green leaves and striking yellow-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a clump-forming bamboo with slender, hollow stems that are often used in landscaping and traditional crafts. Its foliage is dense and provides a lush, green appearance throughout the growing season. The flowering process, while rare, adds a distinctive visual element to the plant's overall aesthetic."
