    "intro": "Betula mandshurica var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The tree produces small, yellow-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are triangular and serrated, turning gold in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Japan and parts of China."
