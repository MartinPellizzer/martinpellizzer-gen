    "intro": "Bakerisideroxylon revolutum var. brevipetiolulatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed ironwood, is a member of the Bignoniaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in racemes, and attract various pollinators. The species is notable for its ecological resilience and is used in traditional medicine and as a source of durable timber."
