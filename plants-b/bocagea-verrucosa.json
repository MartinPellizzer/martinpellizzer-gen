    "intro": "Bocagea verrucosa, commonly known as the warty bocagea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its unique warty texture on the stems and leaves distinguishes it from other similar species. Bocagea verrucosa is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland and swampy areas."
