    "intro": "Bulbophyllum medusella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a ghostly appearance. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
