    "intro": "Buddleja glabrescens, commonly known as the woolly buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to purple, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja glabrescens is often used in ornamental gardening for its ornate foliage and showy blooms."
