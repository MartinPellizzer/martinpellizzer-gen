    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing a single floret. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and drought tolerance."
