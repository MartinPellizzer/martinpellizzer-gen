It features dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Its hardy nature and attractive foliage make it a popular plant in horticultural settings."
