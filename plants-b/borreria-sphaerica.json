    "intro": "Borreria sphaerica, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or globular shape, formed by a dense cluster of cylindrical stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the stem tips. Borreria sphaerica is a succulent, meaning it stores water in its fleshy stems and leaves, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
