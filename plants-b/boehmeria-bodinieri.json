    "intro": "Boehmeria bodinieri, commonly known as Chinese nettle or B. bodinieri, is a species of flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive net-like venation. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Boehmeria bodinieri is also valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used traditionally for making textiles and paper."
