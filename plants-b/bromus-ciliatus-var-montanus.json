    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. montanus, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, elevated habitats."
