    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. excelsa, commonly known as the silver birch, is a tall, slender tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath, and its small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree has slender, drooping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Betula alba subsp. excelsa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
