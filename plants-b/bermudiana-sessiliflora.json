    "intro": "Bermudiana sessiliflora, commonly known as the Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a common weed in lawns and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form dense mats."
