It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar structural and chemical features."
