It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
