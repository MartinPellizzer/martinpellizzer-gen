    "intro": "Bellevalia hispida var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, short pubescence, which becomes less prominent as the plant matures. This variety is notable for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
