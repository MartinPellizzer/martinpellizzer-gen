    "intro": "Bulbophyllum endotrachys, commonly known as the Tracheal Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
