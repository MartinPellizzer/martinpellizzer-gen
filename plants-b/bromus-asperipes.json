    "intro": "Bromus asperipes, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant has erect, hairy stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, contributing to its common name. Bromus asperipes is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife and livestock."
