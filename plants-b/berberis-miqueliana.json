    "intro": "Berberis miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features spiny, thorned stems and small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant seasonal color changes and unique foliage structure."
