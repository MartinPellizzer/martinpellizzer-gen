    "intro": "Blennospora doliiformis, commonly known as the globular liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth form, which consists of a dense cushion of leaf-like structures called thalli. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and contain spores. Blennospora doliiformis is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to survive in low-light, humid conditions."
