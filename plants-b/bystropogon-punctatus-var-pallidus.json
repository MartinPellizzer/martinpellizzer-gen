It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are usually pale green or white. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered together. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain sticky seeds that adhere to the feathers of birds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it forms symbiotic relationships with various tree species."
