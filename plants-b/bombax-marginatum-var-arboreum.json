It is characterized by its large, showy, pinkish-white bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in various regions."
