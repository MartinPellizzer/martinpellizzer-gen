    "intro": "Bulbophyllum viride, commonly known as the green bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
