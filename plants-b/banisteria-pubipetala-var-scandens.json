    "intro": "Banisteria pubipetala var. scandens, commonly known as the climbing banisteria, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or trees in warm climates."
