    "intro": "Begonia neoharlingii, commonly known as the Neoharling's begonia, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant, often bi-colored leaves that display a mix of green, red, and sometimes purple hues. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by collectors and botanists alike."
