    "intro": "Brasiliorchis monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower per stem. The plant produces a single, resupinate flower with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
