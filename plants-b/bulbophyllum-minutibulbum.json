    "intro": "Bulbophyllum minutibulbum, commonly known as the minute bulb orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to thrive in non-native settings."
