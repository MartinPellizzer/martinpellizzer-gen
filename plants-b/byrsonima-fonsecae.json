    "intro": "Byrsonima fonsecae, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cerbera odollam*, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking red flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Despite its beauty, the plant is not commonly cultivated due to its toxicity and specific environmental requirements."
