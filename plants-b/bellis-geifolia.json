    "intro": "Bellis geifolia, commonly known as the alpine daisy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
