    "intro": "Bolboschoenus nobilis, commonly known as the noble bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers at the top of its stems, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in muddy or flooded environments. Bolboschoenus nobilis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
