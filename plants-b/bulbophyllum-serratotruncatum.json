    "intro": "Bulbophyllum serratotruncatum, commonly known as the serrated truncate orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
