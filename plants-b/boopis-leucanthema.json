    "intro": "Boopis leucanthema, commonly known as white-flowered boopis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its white petals are surrounded by a ring of yellow to brown ray florets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Boopis leucanthema is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
