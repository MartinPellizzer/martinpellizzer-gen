    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. emporitana, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is known for its unique, cup-like flower structure that resembles a small biscuit, hence its common name."
