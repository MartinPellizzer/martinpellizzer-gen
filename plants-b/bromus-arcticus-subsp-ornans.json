    "intro": "Bromus arcticus subsp. ornans, commonly known as the Arctic brome, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in extreme conditions. This subspecies is an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for herbivores."
