    "intro": "Begonia zebrina, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright, branching stems that bear heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of dark green and silver stripes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Begonia zebrina is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
