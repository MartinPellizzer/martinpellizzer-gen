It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its rigid, branched structure and aromatic leaves make it a resilient species in harsh environments. Baccharis pedersenii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
