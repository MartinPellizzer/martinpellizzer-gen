    "intro": "Bomarea minima, commonly known as the dwarf bomarea, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as understorey forests. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Bomarea minima is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
