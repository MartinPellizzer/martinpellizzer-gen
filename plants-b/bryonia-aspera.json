    "intro": "Bryonia aspera, commonly known as the rough bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by bright orange, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Bryonia aspera is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be invasive in some regions."
