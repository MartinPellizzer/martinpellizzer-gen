    "intro": "Bouteloua hirsuta f. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sand grass, is a variant of the sand dropseed plant. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant exhibits vivipary, a reproductive trait where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. It is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits."
