    "intro": "Bromidium anomalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky outcrops and sandstone formations. The plant is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. Bromidium anomalum is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and it requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
