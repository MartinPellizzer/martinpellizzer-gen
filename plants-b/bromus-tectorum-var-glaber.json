    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. glaber, commonly known as smooth cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, smooth stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Due to its rapid growth and high seed production, it is considered an invasive species in many areas."
