It typically grows in dry, rocky, and semi-arid environments, often found at high elevations. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Bromus popovii is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine and steppe ecosystems."
