    "intro": "Begonia myriantha, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and cream. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil. Begonia myriantha is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
