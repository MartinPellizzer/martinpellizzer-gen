    "intro": "Bromus segetalis f. grossus, commonly known as the large-seeded cheatgrass, is a variant of the annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and large, elongated spikelets that are often more than 10 mm in length. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in non-native habitats. The foliage is generally coarse and hairy, with leaves that are narrow and slightly rolled."
