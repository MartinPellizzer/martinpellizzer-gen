    "intro": "Baptisia fraxinifolia, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its striking blue to violet flower clusters that appear in early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots are known for their deep taproot system. Baptisia fraxinifolia is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. It also serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species."
