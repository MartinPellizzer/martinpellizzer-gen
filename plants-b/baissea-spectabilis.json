    "intro": "Baissea spectabilis, commonly known as the showy baissea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and thrives in well-drained soil. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
