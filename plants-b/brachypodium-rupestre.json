    "intro": "Brachypodium rupestre, commonly known as rock bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are densely packed, giving it a bristly appearance. Brachypodium rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
