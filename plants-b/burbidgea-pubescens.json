    "intro": "Burbidgea pubescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its structure includes a woody stem with branching patterns that help it conserve water. Burbidgea pubescens plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
