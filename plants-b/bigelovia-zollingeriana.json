    "intro": "Bigelovia zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's bigelovia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open plains. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic properties. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
