    "intro": "Buxus harlandii var. platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf boxwood, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western China. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green leaves that are broader and flatter than those of typical boxwoods, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in hedges and topiary designs."
