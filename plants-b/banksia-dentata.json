    "intro": "Banksia dentata, commonly known as the serrated banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Banksia dentata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
