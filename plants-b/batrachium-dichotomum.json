    "intro": "Batrachium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous batrachium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into several lobes, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small organisms."
