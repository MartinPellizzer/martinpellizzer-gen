    "intro": "Banksia brownii, commonly known as the Brown's banksia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has a woody stem and produces cylindrical, hairy fruiting structures known as follicles. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Banksia brownii is an important component of the coastal heathland ecosystems where it thrives."
