    "intro": "Buddleja sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved butterfly bush, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features upright stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces panicle-like clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and lavender, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Buddleja sessiliflora is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
