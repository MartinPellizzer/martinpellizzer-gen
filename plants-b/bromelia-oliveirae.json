    "intro": "Bromelia oliveirae, commonly known as the Oliveira's bromeliad, is a species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The plant produces striking, inflorescence with bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Bromelia oliveirae is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests and undergrowth areas."
