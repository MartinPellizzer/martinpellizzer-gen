    "intro": "Betula utilis var. sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is adapted to high-altitude environments and exhibits varying growth habits depending on local climate conditions."
