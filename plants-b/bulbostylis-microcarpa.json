    "intro": "Bulbostylis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale green to brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and of interest to botanists and conservationists."
