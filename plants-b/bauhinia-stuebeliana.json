    "intro": "Bauhinia stuebeliana, commonly known as the velvetwood or flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in the spring and summer. Bauhinia stuebeliana has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
