It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
