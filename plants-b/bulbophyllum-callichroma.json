    "intro": "Bulbophyllum callichroma, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange, with intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, helping it survive in its natural habitat. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
