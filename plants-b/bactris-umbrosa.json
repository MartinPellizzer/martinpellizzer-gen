    "intro": "Bactris umbrosa, commonly known as the dark bactris, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, fibrous pulp. Bactris umbrosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecosystems in which it grows."
