It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Bifaria attenuata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
