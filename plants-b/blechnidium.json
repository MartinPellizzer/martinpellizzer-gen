    "intro": "Blechnidium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Blechnidium species typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that help in spreading and survival. The fronds are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a finely divided appearance. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
