It features a tall, spiny stem with numerous branches that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking visual element to its desert habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting to harsh environmental conditions. This variety is valued for its resilience and unique appearance in botanical collections."
