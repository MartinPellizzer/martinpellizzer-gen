    "intro": "Besleria spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny besleria, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Besleria spinulosa is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
