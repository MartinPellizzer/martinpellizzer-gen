    "intro": "Baccharis spathulata, commonly known as broadleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Baccharis spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
