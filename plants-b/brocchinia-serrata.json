    "intro": "Brocchinia serrata, commonly known as the serrated brocchinia, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding pool, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and recurved, with serrated edges that give it its common name. It produces vibrant, showy flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in shades of red or orange. Brocchinia serrata is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
