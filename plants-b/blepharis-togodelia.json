    "intro": "Blepharis togodelia, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the late afternoon. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal insects such as moths. Blepharis togodelia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
