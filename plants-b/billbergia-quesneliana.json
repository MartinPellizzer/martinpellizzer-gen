It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its inflorescence consists of striking red or orange flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves. This ornamental plant is valued for its vibrant color and air-purifying qualities in indoor gardening."
