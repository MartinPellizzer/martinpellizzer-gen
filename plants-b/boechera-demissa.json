    "intro": "Boechera demissa, commonly known as the rockcress or white-stemmed rockcress, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, oblanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Boechera demissa is native to North America and is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
