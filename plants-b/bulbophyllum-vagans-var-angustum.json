    "intro": "Bulbophyllum vagans var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pendant-like inflorescence and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often clustered at the base of the pseudobulbs. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
