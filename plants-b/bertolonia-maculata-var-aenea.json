It features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery or grayish-blue hue, often marked with dark veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens.
