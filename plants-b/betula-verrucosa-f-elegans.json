    "intro": "Betula verrucosa f. elegans, commonly known as the elegant birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its smooth, white bark and slender, graceful form. It is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of North America, often found in boreal forests and subarctic environments. The plant exhibits a shallow root system and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a doubly serrated margin, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. The bark peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance that makes it a popular ornamental species."
