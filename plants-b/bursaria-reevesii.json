    "intro": "Bursaria reevesii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and woody, shrub-like growth. The plant typically grows in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Bursaria reevesii is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making and other crafts."
