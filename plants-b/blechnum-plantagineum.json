    "intro": "Blechnum plantagineum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
