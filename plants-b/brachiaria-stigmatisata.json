    "intro": "Brachiaria stigmatisata, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as pastures, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its common name, while its seeds are dispersed by wind. Brachiaria stigmatisata is often used in forage systems due to its adaptability and nutritional value for livestock."
