    "intro": "Butia exilata, commonly known as the Paraguay palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is a small, cold-hardy palm that typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange-red fruits, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Butia exilata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
