It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, fluffy red flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces a capsule fruit that contains cotton-like fibers, which are used in traditional crafts and as a natural insulator. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in coastal and humid environments."
