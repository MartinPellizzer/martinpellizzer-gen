    "intro": "Berberis pseudumbellata, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, glossy green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall, and its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters. The plant produces red berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
