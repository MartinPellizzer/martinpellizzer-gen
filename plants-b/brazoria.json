    "intro": "Brazoria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments. They have distinctive blue or purple flower heads that resemble small holly berries, hence their common name. The leaves are usually narrow and sometimes covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. Brazoria species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
