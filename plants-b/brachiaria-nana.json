    "intro": "Brachiaria nana, commonly known as little barnyard grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a slightly hairy surface. Brachiaria nana is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
