    "intro": "Baccharis racemosa var. obtusifolia, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a valuable plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
