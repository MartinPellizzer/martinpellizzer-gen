    "intro": "Brassica oleracea convar. gemmifera, commonly known as cauliflower, is a cool-season crop characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other members of the Brassica genus, such as broccoli and cabbage. Its botanical structure includes a thick, leafy stem with tightly clustered flower buds that form the edible portion. The plant typically grows to a height of 40\u201380 cm and produces white or green flower heads. It requires a short day length for proper head formation and is typically harvested before the flowers open."
