    "intro": "Bertolonia disraelii, commonly known as the Disraeli's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in grassland and rocky habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in coastal and inland regions with well-drained soils. Bertolonia disraelii is relatively drought-tolerant and has adapted to the variable climate of its native environment."
