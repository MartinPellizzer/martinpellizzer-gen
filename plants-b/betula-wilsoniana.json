    "intro": "Betula wilsoniana, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula wilsoniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
