    "intro": "Berchemia elmeri, commonly known as the silver bush, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Berchemia elmeri is often used in coastal or rock garden settings due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
