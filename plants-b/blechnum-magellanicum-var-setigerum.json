    "intro": "Blechnum magellanicum var. setigerum, commonly known as the Magellanic harts-tongue fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to southern South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, narrow, and often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
