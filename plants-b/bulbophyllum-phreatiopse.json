    "intro": "Bulbophyllum phreatiopse, commonly known as the water orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its unique bulb-like structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in moist or semi-aquatic environments. The plant typically has long, slender leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid conditions and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in swampy or marshy areas."
