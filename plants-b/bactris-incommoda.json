    "intro": "Bactris incommoda, commonly known as the pink rafia palm, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by edible, orange-colored fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts and basket-making due to their fibrous texture. Bactris incommoda thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
