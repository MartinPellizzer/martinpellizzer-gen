It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within montane forests, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
