    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
