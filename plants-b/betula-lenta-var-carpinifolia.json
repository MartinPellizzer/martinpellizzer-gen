    "intro": "Betula lenta var. carpinifolia, commonly known as the sugarberry or carpinifolia birch, is a variant of the yellow birch native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and small, elongated leaves that are often reddish in color. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
