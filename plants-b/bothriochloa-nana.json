    "intro": "Bothriochloa nana, commonly known as dwarf bluestem, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It typically reaches a height of less than 30 centimeters, with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage plant for livestock."
