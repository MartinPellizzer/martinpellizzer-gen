    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, yellow flowers in early spring. Its botanical characteristics include a taproot system and hairy stems, which help it conserve water in arid conditions. It is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
