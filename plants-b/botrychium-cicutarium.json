    "intro": "Botrychium cicutarium, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, club-like rhizome and a pair of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are arranged in a distinctive, umbrella-like cluster on the underside of the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium cicutarium is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
