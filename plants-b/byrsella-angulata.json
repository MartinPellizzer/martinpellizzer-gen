    "intro": "Byrsella angulata, commonly known as the angular bryophyte, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive angular leaf-like structures, which are typically arranged in dense, mat-forming growths. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its small, greenish-yellow gametophyte is adapted for nutrient absorption through its thallus. Byrsella angulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
