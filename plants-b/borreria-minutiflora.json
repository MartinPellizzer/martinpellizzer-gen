    "intro": "Borreria minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flower borreria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. Borreria minutiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact form and delicate blooms."
