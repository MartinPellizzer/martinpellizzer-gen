    "intro": "Borreria pygmaea var. obtusa, commonly known as the narrowleaf borreria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
