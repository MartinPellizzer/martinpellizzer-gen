    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tollenoniferum, commonly known as the Tolentino orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
