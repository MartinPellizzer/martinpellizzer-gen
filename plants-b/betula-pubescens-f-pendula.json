    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a distinctive variant of the silver birch. It is characterized by its cascading, drooping branches that give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The tree has slender, white-barked trunks and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often planted in gardens for its visual appeal. The plant is native to northern Europe and parts of Asia, where it grows in moist, well-drained soils."
