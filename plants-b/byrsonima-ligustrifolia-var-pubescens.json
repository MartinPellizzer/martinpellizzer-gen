    "intro": "Byrsonima ligustrifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bitter apple, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. The fruit is edible when ripe but has a tart, bitter flavor, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
