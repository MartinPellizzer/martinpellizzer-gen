    "intro": "Betula humilis var. palustris, commonly known as the swamp birch, is a low-growing shrub native to the wetlands of northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and swampy areas."
