    "intro": "Brocchinia cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall bromeliad, is a species native to the tepuis of South America, particularly Venezuela and Guyana. It is a striking plant characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically green with a bluish or purple tint, and they are adapted to collect rainwater in their central cup, which serves as a microhabitat for various small organisms. This plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or cliffs. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
