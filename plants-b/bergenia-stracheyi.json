    "intro": "Bergenia stracheyi, commonly known as the Tibetan begonia, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of China, India, and Nepal. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. Bergenia stracheyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
