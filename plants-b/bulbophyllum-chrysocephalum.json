    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chrysocephalum, commonly known as the golden-headed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers bloom in clusters and are often used in horticultural displays due to their vibrant color and unique appearance."
