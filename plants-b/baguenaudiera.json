    "intro": "Baguenaudiera, commonly known as the \"idler\" or \"wandering plant,\" is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland margins and rocky soils. Its name reflects its habit of growing in scattered, wandering patches rather than forming dense stands. Baguenaudiera is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild aromatic properties."
