It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically has smooth, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. Bujacia is often found in dry, rocky areas and is adapted to arid conditions. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and medicinal contexts."
