    "intro": "Bulbophyllum osyriceroides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, translucent greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are highly fragrant and bloom during the night, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
