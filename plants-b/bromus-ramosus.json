    "intro": "Bromus ramosus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often branch near the base. The leaves are typically hairy, especially along the margins, giving the plant its common name. It produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, loose panicles, and the flowers are small and wind-pollinated. This plant is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils."
