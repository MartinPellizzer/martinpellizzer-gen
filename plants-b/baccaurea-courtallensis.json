    "intro": "Baccaurea courtallensis, commonly known as the Kottayam date palm, is a tropical plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible, fleshy fruits resembling dates. The fruits are typically harvested when they are fully mature and have a sweet, nutty flavor. It is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible yield."
