    "intro": "Blechnum brasiliense var. corcovadense, commonly known as the Brazilian holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, and is well adapted to humid tropical climates. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
