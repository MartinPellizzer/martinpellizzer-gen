    "intro": "Betula alba var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock birch, is a variant of the white birch that is adapted to rocky and mountainous environments. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and small, oval leaves that are usually dark green on top and pale white underneath. The bark is thin and peels in papery strips, similar to other birch species, but it tends to be more rugged due to its habitat. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its presence is an indicator of harsh, rocky terrain where few other plants can grow."
