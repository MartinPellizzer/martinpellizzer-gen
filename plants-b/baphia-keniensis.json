    "intro": "Baphia keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan baphia, is a flowering plant native to East Africa, particularly Kenya. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in secondary forests. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
