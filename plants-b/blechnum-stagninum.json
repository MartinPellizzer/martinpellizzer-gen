    "intro": "Blechnum stagninum, commonly known as the water holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns."
