    "intro": "Blepharis ogadenensis, commonly known as the Ogaden sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Horn of Africa. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to sandy and dry soils, making it a common sight in semi-desert regions of Ethiopia and Somalia."
