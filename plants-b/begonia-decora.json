It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia decora is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
