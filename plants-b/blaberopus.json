    "intro": "Blaberopus, commonly known as the giant African land snail, is a large gastropod mollusk native to East Africa. It belongs to the family Achatinidae and is characterized by its heavy, spiral-shaped shell and moist, muscular body. The plant-like appearance of its shell and the way it moves slowly across surfaces often lead to confusion with certain plants. While not a plant, it plays a significant role in its ecosystem as both a herbivore and a prey species. Its presence is also notable in regions where it has been introduced as an invasive species."
