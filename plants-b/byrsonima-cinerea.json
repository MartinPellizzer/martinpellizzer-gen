    "intro": "Byrsonima cinerea, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy berries that turn from green to yellow or red as they mature. Its leaves and fruits have been used in traditional medicine and as food by various indigenous communities. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
