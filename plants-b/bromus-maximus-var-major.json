    "intro": "Bromus maximus var. major, commonly known as the giant brome, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils, pastures, and roadsides. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
