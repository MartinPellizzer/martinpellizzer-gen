    "intro": "Bromus noeanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, grass-like flowering structures. Bromus noeanus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
