    "intro": "Bulbophyllum interpositum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and long, thin leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or grayish hair. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is a subject of conservation interest."
