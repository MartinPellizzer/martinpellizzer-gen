    "intro": "Billbergia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf billbergia, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
