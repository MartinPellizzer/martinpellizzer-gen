    "intro": "Berzelia intermedia, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassland and savanna habitats. The plant features showy yellow flowers with a distinctive cup-like shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Berzelia intermedia is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
