    "intro": "Bulbophyllum centrosemiflorum, commonly known as the Central Semiflorous Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, and produces multiple racemes of small, fragrant flowers. Its floral display is characterized by white to pale yellow petals and sepals, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with intricate patterns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
