    "intro": "Brickellia arguta, commonly known as roughleaf brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in desert or arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Brickellia arguta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
