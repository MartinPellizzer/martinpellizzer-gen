    "intro": "Balsas guerrerensis, commonly known as the Guerrerense balsa, is a rare and critically endangered tree species native to the tropical rainforests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Bombacaceae family and is characterized by its large, buttressed roots and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in fragmented forest patches. Due to habitat loss and overexploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
