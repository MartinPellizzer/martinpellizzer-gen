    "intro": "Beta macrorhiza, commonly known as the giant horseradish, is a perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a robust root system that can grow quite deep in the soil. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Its roots are known for their strong, pungent odor, similar to that of horseradish. Beta macrorhiza is often cultivated for its aromatic roots and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
