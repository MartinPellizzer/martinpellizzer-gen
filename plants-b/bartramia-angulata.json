    "intro": "Bartramia angulata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with numerous branches, and its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division. Bartramia angulata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in the study of fern botany."
