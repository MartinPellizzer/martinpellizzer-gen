It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
