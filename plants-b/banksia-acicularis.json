    "intro": "Banksia acicularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces unique cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are an important nectar source for honeyeaters and other native birds. Banksia acicularis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can survive in harsh, dry conditions."
