    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. rupestris, commonly known as rock cabbage, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by round, green pods containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to rocky and poor soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and useful in traditional herbal medicine."
