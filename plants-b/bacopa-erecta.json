    "intro": "Bacopa erecta, commonly known as water bead plant or Indian water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It has small, floating leaves that are often used in aquariums due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that are typically borne in clusters. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and prefers moderate to high light conditions. Bacopa erecta is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it useful in water purification efforts."
