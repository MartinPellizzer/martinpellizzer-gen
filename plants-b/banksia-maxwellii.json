    "intro": "Banksia maxwellii, commonly known as the Maxwell's banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia maxwellii thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife."
