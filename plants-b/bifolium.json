    "intro": "Bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its distinctive two leaflets that form a compound leaf structure, giving it its name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in woodland or along stream banks. Bifolium has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its aromatic leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
