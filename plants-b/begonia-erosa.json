    "intro": "Begonia erosa, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features trailing stems that produce small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and prolonged flowering period."
