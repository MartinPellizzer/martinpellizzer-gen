    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as gravelly slopes and open woodlands. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is tuberous, which helps it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in USDA hardiness zones 4 to 8, preferring full sun to partial shade."
