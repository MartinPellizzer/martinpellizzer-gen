It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and the leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Blaeria breviflora is considered a rare and endangered species."
