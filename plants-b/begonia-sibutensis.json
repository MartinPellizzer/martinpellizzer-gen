    "intro": "Begonia sibutensis, commonly known as the Sibutense begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy, glossy surface. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the end of its stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
