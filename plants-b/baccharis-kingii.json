    "intro": "Baccharis kingii, commonly known as the King's baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Baccharis kingii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
