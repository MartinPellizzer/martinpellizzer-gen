    "intro": "Bryodesma muticum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of small, lanceolate leaves that are usually bright green. Its fronds are usually unifoliate, with a short, stout stalk and a single, narrow leaf blade. Bryodesma muticum is valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its ornamental foliage, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
