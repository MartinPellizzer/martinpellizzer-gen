    "intro": "Bolelia, commonly known as the \"ghost fern,\" is a genus of ferns native to the tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, often translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, giving it its evocative common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Bolelia species have a unique reproductive structure, with spore-producing capsules that are often clustered at the tips of the fronds. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
