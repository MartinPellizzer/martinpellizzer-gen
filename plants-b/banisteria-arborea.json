    "intro": "Banisteria arborea, commonly known as the red-wood or red-bark tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dense canopy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by long, narrow pods containing flat, dark seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green surface. Banisteria arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local medicine."
