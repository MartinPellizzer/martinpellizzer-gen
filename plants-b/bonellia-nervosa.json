    "intro": "Bonellia nervosa, commonly known as the common bonellia, is a marine polychaete worm found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Bonellidae and is characterized by its elongated, segmented body. The plant-like appearance of its anterior end, which includes a leaf-like structure, is a notable botanical feature. This structure is actually a modified head with specialized cells for photosynthesis, though it does not perform photosynthesis itself. Bonellia nervosa plays a role in marine ecosystems as a filter feeder, contributing to nutrient cycling in coastal environments."
