    "intro": "Bromus tectorum subsp. nudus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This subspecies typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in areas with low moisture and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
