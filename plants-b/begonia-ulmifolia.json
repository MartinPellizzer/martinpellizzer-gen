It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that resemble those of the ivy plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds. Its foliage is not only ornamental but also has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
