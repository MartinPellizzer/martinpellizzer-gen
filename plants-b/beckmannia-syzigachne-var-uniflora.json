    "intro": "Beckmannia syzigachne var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear a single flower per spikelet. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open grasslands and disturbed sites. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
