    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. pennsylvanicum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania moonwort, is a fern-like herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, club-shaped sporangia that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are divided into two parts, with the upper portion being more elongated than the lower. Botrychium obliquum var. pennsylvanicum plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to nutrient cycling."
