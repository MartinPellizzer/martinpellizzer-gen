    "intro": "Butinia stylosa, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
