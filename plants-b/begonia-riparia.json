    "intro": "Begonia riparia, commonly known as the river begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, which explains its common name. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, velvety texture, and it produces a fragrant scent during the flowering season. Begonia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in moist, shaded garden environments."
