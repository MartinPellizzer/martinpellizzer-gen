    "intro": "Boscia oleoides, commonly known as the yellow boscia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark that can range from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Boscia oleoides is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
