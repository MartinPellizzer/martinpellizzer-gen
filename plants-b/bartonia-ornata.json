It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slightly serrated margin. Bartonia ornata is typically found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
