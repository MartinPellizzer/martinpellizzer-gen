    "intro": "Bartonia virginica f. abortiva, commonly known as the abortive bartonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, often in swampy or marshy habitats. Its unique feature is the abortion of its fruit, giving it the common name. This botanical variation makes it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
