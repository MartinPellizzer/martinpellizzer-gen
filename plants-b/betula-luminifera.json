    "intro": "Betula luminifera, commonly known as the glowing birch, is a unique species characterized by its bioluminescent properties. Its leaves and bark emit a soft, blue-green light during the night, a phenomenon attributed to specialized luciferin-luciferase reactions. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. Its luminous features make it a subject of scientific interest and ecological significance. The botanical structure includes smooth, white bark and serrated, lance-shaped leaves."
