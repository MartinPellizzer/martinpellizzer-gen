    "intro": "Bromus commutatus f. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-leaved brome, is a grass species characterized by its reduced foliage and compact growth habit. It typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often shorter and less robust compared to the typical form of Bromus commutatus. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. This form is considered a botanical variant, showing morphological variation within the species."
