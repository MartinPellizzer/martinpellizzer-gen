It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, clustered flowers during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
