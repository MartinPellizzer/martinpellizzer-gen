    "intro": "Beaucarnea guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan elephant tree, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, swollen, tree-like stem that resembles an elephant's head, hence its common name. The plant has sparse, fibrous roots and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are short and cylindrical, arranged in a rosette pattern, and it is adapted to arid environments. Beaucarnea guatemalensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
