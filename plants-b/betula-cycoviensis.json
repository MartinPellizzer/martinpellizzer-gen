    "intro": "Betula cycoviensis, commonly known as the Cycoviens birch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, grayish bark that exfoliates in thin, papery layers. The leaves are oval to lanceolate, with serrated margins and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for its pollination process. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine forests."
