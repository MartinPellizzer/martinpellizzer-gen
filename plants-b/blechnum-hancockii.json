    "intro": "Blechnum hancockii, commonly known as the Hancock's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically fan-shaped. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are divided into segments, giving the plant a distinctive, intricate appearance."
