It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for both gardeners and botanists."
