    "intro": "Bromus canescens, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with silver or pale green. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine hairs. Bromus canescens is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
