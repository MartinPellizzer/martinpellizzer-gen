    "intro": "Bixa orellana var. platycarpa, commonly known as the \"false annatto\" or \"brazil nut tree,\" is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that develop into woody capsules containing edible seeds. The seeds are often used as a substitute for true Brazil nuts, though they are smaller and have a different flavor profile. The plant also has ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for its potential medicinal properties."
