It is characterized by its fibrous, hollow stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is also valued for its strong, fibrous stalks, which have been used in textile production."
