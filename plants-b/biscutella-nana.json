    "intro": "Biscutella nana, commonly known as dwarf biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Biscutella nana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions."
