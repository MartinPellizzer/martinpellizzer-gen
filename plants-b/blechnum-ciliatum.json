    "intro": "Blechnum ciliatum, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its mature fronds."
