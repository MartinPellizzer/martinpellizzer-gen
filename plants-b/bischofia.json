    "intro": "Bischofia, commonly known as flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, often red or orange flowers that appear in clusters, and their palmately lobed leaves. Bischofia species typically have rough, bark-like stems and produce capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral displays."
