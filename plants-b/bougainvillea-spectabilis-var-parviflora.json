    "intro": "Bougainvillea spectabilis var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf bougainvillea, is a compact shrub native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, vibrant flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces showy bracts that enclose the tiny, true flowers, which are often overlooked. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in gardens and containers."
