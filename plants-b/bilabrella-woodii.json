    "intro": "Bilabrella woodii, commonly known as the Wood's bilabrella, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, small, and often clustered leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bilabrella woodii is considered a vulnerable species."
