    "intro": "Bruguiera candel, commonly known as the candle bush, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, candle-like appearance with long, thin branches. The plant is a mangrove species that thrives in brackish water environments, often forming dense thickets in coastal areas. Its roots are adapted to filter salt from seawater, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems. Bruguiera candel produces small, white flowers that attract pollinators and contribute to the biodiversity of its habitat."
