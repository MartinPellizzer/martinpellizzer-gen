    "intro": "Baccaurea cavalliensis, commonly known as the Cavallies' mangosteen, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces clusters of small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. The fruit has a thick, segmented rind and a sweet, aromatic pulp, making it a valued species in local horticulture. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
