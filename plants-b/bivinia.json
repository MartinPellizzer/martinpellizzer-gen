    "intro": "Bivinia, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Bivinia prefers cool, shady environments and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique blooming cycle and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and native plant collections."
