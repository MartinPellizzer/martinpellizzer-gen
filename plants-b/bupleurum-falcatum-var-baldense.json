    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum var. baldense, commonly known as the broadleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other varieties within the Bupleurum genus."
