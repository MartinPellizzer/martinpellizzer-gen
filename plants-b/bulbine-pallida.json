    "intro": "Bulbine pallida, commonly known as the white bulbous plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, basal leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Its resilience makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
