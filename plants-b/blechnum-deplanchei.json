    "intro": "Blechnum deplanchei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are often folded or rolled when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and thrive in suitable habitats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape that gives the plant its common name."
