    "intro": "Bursa viminalis, commonly known as the willow burs, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Bursa viminalis is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and in woodland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
