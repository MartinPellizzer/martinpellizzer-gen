    "intro": "Bauhinia creaghii, commonly known as the white bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets. Bauhinia creaghii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
