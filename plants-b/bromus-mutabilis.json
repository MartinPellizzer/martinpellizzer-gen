    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis, commonly known as the variable brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its variable growth habits, often appearing as either a tufted or rhizomatous plant depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to reddish in color, with lemmas that may change color as the plant matures. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Bromus mutabilis is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands."
