    "intro": "Boehmeria platyphylla f. androgyna, commonly known as the Androgyna form of flat-leafed Boehmeria, is a variant of the Boehmeria genus native to East Asia. It is characterized by its flat, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is a flowering herbaceous species that thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its inflorescences produce small, greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. This form is of interest in botanical studies for its morphological variation and potential ecological roles."
