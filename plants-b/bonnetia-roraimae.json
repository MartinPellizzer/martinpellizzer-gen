    "intro": "Bonnetia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima bonnetia, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of South America, particularly Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and diverse ecological adaptations. The plant is notable for its small, clustered inflorescences and hairy foliage, which help it thrive in the nutrient-poor soils of its high-altitude habitat. Bonnetia roraimae is often found in rocky outcrops and open grasslands, where it plays a role in the unique flora of the region. Due to its restricted distribution and fragile environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
