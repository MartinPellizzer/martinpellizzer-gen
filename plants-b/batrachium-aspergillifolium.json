    "intro": "Batrachium aspergillifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved frog's mouth, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its scientific name reflects its rough foliage and the shape of its leaves, which resemble the mouth of a frog. Batrachium aspergillifolium is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
