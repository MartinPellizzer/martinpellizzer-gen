    "intro": "Billardiera cymosa subsp. cymosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed moonflower, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
