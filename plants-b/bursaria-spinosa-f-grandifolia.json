    "intro": "Bursaria spinosa f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered burr bush, is a shrub native to coastal areas of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and pairs of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits that persist through winter. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
