    "intro": "Borassus flabellifer, commonly known as the palm tree, is a tall, slender tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It has a straight trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by large, fibrous fruits containing a single seed. Its roots are fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or coastal soils. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional crafts and as a source of palm sugar."
