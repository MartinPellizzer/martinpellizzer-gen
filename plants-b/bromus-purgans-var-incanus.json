    "intro": "Bromus purgans var. incanus, commonly known as the silver brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. The species is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soils."
