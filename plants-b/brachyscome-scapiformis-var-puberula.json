    "intro": "Brachyscome scapiformis var. puberula, commonly known as the woolly bluebell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It features dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers surrounded by white bracts, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which extends from late spring to autumn."
