    "intro": "Benstonea herbacea, commonly known as the slender benstonea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a loose, umbel-like cluster. Its growth habit is typically clump-forming, with rhizomatous roots that help it spread vegetatively. Benstonea herbacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to shaded garden conditions."
