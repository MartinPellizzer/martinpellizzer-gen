    "intro": "Boottia kunenensis, commonly known as the Kunen's boottia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on alpine plant adaptations and conservation biology."
