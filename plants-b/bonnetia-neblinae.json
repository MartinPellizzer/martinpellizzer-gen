    "intro": "Bonnetia neblinae, commonly known as the misty bonnetia, is a species of flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive, elongated calyx that gives it its common name. Due to its habitat in high-altitude, humid environments, it is adapted to thrive in shade and requires specific conditions for successful cultivation."
