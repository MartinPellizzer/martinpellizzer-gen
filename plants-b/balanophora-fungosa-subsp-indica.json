    "intro": "Balanophora fungosa subsp. indica, commonly known as the Indian ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. It is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in the Western Ghats of India."
