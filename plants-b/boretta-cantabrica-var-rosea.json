It features showy, rose-pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, making it a valuable subject for botanical conservation efforts."
