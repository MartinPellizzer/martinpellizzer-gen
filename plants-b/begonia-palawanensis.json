It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
