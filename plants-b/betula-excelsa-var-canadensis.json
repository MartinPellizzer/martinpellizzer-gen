    "intro": "Betula excelsa var. canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils in full sun. Its leaves are triangular, doubly serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. The Canadian paper birch produces small, yellowish catkins and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
