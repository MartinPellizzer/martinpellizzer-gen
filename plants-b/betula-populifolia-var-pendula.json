    "intro": "Betula populifolia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully from the main trunk. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring and has distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin layers. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. The weeping birch is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique, flowing appearance."
