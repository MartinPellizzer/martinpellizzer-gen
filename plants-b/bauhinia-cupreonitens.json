    "intro": "Bauhinia cupreonitens, commonly known as the copperleaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are compound and trifoliate, with each leaflet having a reddish or coppery hue. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its fruits are legumes that split open to release flat, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Bauhinia cupreonitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
