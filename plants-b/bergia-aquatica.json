    "intro": "Bergia aquatica, commonly known as water bellflower, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Bergia aquatica plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
