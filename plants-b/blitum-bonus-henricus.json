It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
