    "intro": "Brachystelma inandense, commonly known as the Andean starfish cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, ribbed stems. The plant produces vibrant, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Brachystelma inandense is adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and protect it from herbivores. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
