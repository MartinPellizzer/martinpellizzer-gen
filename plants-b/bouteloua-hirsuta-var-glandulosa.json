    "intro": "Bouteloua hirsuta var. glandulosa, commonly known as hairy grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common component of grassland and shrubland ecosystems. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
