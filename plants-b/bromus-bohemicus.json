    "intro": "Bromus bohemicus, commonly known as the Bohemian brome, is a grass species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Bromus bohemicus is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
