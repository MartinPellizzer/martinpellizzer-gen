    "intro": "Butyrospermum, commonly known as shea butter tree, is a tropical plant native to the savannas of Africa. It produces a large, smooth, green fruit that contains a high amount of oils within its seed. The fruit's pulp is typically fermented and then pressed to extract the valuable shea butter. The plant is valued for its economic and medicinal properties. Its botanical name, *Butyrospermum parkii*, reflects its oil-rich seeds."
