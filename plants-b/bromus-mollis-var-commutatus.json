    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. commutatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
