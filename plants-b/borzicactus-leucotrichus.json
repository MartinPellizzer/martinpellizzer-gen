    "intro": "Borzicactus leucotrichus, commonly known as the white-haired cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne at the base of the stem. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. Borzicactus leucotrichus is a slow-growing plant that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
