    "intro": "Brachatera decumbens, commonly known as the creeping brachatera, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. Brachatera decumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
