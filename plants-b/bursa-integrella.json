It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Bursa integrella is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
