    "intro": "Botryodendrum coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with linear, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in moist environments. Botryodendrum coriaceum is often found in shallow water or saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
