    "intro": "Blechnum reflexum, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodiaceous fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length and have a distinctive, spoon-shaped appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. Blechnum reflexum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, temperate regions."
