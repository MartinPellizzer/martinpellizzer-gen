    "intro": "Bolosia, commonly known as the wild indigo, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often zigzag-shaped stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Bolosia species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to regions of Africa, Madagascar, and parts of Asia. They are known for their ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are usually pinnately compound, and the plant produces pods that contain seeds used in traditional medicine and as a source of dye."
