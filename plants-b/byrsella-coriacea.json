    "intro": "Byrsella coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
