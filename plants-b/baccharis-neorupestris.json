It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
