    "intro": "Bocconia vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic bocconia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Bocconia vulcanica is known for its resilience to harsh mountain climates and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats."
