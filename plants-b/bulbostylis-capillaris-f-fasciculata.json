    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris f. fasciculata, commonly known as the fasciculate bulbostylis, is a rare grass species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
