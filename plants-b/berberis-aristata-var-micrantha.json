It features thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, containing berberine, a compound with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects."
