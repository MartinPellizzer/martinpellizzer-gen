    "intro": "Butia matogrossensis, commonly known as the Matogrossense palm, is a species native to Brazil, particularly in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. It is a small, slow-growing palm that typically reaches a height of around 5 meters. The plant features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces large, feather-like leaves that form a dense crown. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces edible fruits that are similar to those of other butia palms. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
