    "intro": "Bucco prolifera, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking pink or red bracts that resemble coral, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
