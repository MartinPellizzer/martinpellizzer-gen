    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. divergens, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed glumes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in agricultural areas and can be both a weed and a forage plant."
