    "intro": "Bactris palustris, commonly known as the swamp palm, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the wetlands and marshy areas of South America, particularly in regions like Colombia and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which are typically found near the base of the plant. Bactris palustris is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
