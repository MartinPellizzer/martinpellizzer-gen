    "intro": "Basananthe scabrifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved banana plant, is a tropical herbaceous species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
