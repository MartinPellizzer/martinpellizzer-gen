    "intro": "Bunium perotii, commonly known as wild garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers and has a strong garlic-like odor due to its sulfur-containing compounds. Its leaves are basal, resembling those of garlic, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Bunium perotii is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
