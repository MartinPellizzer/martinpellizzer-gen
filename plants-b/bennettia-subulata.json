    "intro": "Bennettia subulata, commonly known as the slender Bennettia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, spire-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. Bennettia subulata is a member of the Proteaceae family, known for its showy and often unusual floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
