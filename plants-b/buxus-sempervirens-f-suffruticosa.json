    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens f. suffruticosa, commonly known as the compact boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant typically grows in a rounded form, making it ideal for topiary and ornamental landscaping. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in moist, cool conditions. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is often used in formal garden designs."
