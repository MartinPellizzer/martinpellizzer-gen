    "intro": "Balanophora simaoensis, commonly known as the Simao ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to China. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungi for its nutrients. The plant produces small, white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. It grows in dense forest understories, often in association with specific tree species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered."
