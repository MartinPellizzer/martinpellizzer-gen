    "intro": "Becium obovatum var. modestum, commonly known as the modest becium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts well to dry and nutrient-poor conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
