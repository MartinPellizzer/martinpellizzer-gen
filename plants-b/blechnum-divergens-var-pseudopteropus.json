    "intro": "Blechnum divergens var. pseudopteropus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the Blechnum genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This fern is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky crevices."
