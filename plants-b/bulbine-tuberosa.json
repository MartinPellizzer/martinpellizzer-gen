    "intro": "Bulbine tuberosa, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, tubular red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
