    "intro": "Begonia depingiana, commonly known as the pink begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a rich red or purple underside. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is popular in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
