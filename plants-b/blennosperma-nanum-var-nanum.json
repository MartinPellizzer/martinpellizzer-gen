    "intro": "Blennosperma nanum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf blennosperma, is a small, annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, dry fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. Its compact size and resilience make it a characteristic species of sandy and rocky soils in its native habitat."
