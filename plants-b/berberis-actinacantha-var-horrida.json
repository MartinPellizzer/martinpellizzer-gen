    "intro": "Berberis actinacantha var. horrida, commonly known as the rough barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at high altitudes. Its ornamental value is limited due to its prickly nature, but it is valued in traditional medicine for its medicinal properties."
