    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 seideliana, commonly known as the white poplar, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and heart-shaped with a serrated margin. Betula \u00d7 seideliana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands."
