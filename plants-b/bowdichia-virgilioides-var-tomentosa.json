    "intro": "Bowdichia virgilioides var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. Its hairy or tomentose surfaces, particularly on young growth, give it its common name. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
