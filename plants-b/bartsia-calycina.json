    "intro": "Bartsia calycina, commonly known as the scarlet bartsia, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bright red or orange-red, clustered in whorls along the stems, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Bartsia calycina is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis."
