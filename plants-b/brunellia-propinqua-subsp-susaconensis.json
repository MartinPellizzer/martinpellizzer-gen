    "intro": "Brunellia propinqua subsp. susaconensis, commonly known as the Susac\u00f3n bush, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
