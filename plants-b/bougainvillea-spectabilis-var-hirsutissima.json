    "intro": "Bougainvillea spectabilis var. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has a woody stem with thorn-like protrusions and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers inside the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of small, pointed leaves that are typically green and glossy."
