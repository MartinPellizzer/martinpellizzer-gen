    "intro": "Bryonia sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, while its roots are thick and tuberous. Bryonia sicula is often found in rocky or dry habitats and has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its toxic properties require caution."
