    "intro": "Bromus contortus, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, tufted growth form, often forming a carpet-like appearance. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are usually slightly folded, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Bromus contortus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
