It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries. Beyrichia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
