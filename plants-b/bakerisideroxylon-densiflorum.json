    "intro": "Bakerisideroxylon densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it can live for several decades, making it a valuable component of the local ecosystem. Due to its rarity and ecological importance, it is often found in protected areas."
