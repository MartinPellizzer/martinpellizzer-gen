    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. melzeri, commonly known as the moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is distinguished by its small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are simple and unbranched, with a basal rosette structure that aids in moisture retention. The varietal form melzeri is notable for its specific spore morphology and habitat preferences, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
