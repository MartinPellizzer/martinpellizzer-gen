    "intro": "Banksia pteridifolia subsp. pteridifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. It plays an important role in providing nectar for native wildlife, particularly honeyeaters and other nectar-feeding birds."
