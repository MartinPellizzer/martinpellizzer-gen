It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically dark green on top and silvery white underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Betula nana var. michauxii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various Arctic flora and fauna."
