    "intro": "Bergenia ligulata var. leichtlinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bergenia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features thick, fleshy rhizomes and produces clusters of pink to red flowers in early spring. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and hardy nature."
