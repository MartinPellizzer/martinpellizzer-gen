    "intro": "Bulbophyllum grandimesense, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, serving as storage organs for water and nutrients. The flowers are usually borne on long, branching inflorescences, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and collections."
