    "intro": "Begonia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of red, pink, or white. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a glossy, dark green surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its vibrant flowers, which bloom during the warmer months."
