    "intro": "Brassica napus f. biennis, commonly known as the oilseed rape or canola, is a cultivar of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is characterized by its large, yellow flowers and is primarily cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a robust stem and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are self-pollinated, which contributes to its high seed yield. The botanical features of this plant make it well-suited for agricultural production in temperate climates."
