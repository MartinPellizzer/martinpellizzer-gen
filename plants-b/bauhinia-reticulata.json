    "intro": "Bauhinia reticulata, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure containing several seeds. Bauhinia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
