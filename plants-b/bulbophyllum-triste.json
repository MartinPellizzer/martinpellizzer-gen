    "intro": "Bulbophyllum triste, commonly known as the sad orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a contrasting lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the orchid family."
