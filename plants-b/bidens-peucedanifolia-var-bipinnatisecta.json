    "intro": "Bidens peucedanifolia var. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the bipinnatisect beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bristly, seed-bearing structures. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
