    "intro": "Betula ermanii var. tomentosa, commonly known as the silver birch or woolly birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver underlayer, giving it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
