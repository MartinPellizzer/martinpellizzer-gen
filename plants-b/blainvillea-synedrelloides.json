It features showy, yellow-centered flowers with red or orange petals, typically blooming in the summer months. The plant has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture and produces small, green, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
