    "intro": "Blandfordia grandiflora var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed Christmas lily, is a striking South African plant belonging to the Hyacinthaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that becomes more prominent as the bloom matures.
