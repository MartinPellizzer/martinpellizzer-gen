It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically produces a single or few lateral pseudobulbs, each supporting a pair of opposite leaves. Its flowers are arranged in a raceme and are notable for their intricate, lip-like structures. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
