    "intro": "Braya oxycarpa, commonly known as the sharp-fruited bladderwort, is a small herbaceous plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its tiny, rounded leaves and delicate flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in environments with limited water availability. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Braya oxycarpa is often used in ecological studies due to its ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
