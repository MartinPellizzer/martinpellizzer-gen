    "intro": "Banksia elatior, commonly known as the large banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its large, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Banksia elatior thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for various pollinators and habitat for native wildlife."
