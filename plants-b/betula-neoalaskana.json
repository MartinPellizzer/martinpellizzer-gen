    "intro": "Betula neoalaskana, commonly known as the Alaska birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, often revealing a yellowish or reddish inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula neoalaskana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
