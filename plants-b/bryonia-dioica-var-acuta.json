    "intro": "Bryonia dioica var. acuta, commonly known as sharp bryony, is a prickly, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the genus Bryonia in the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squash. The plant features distinctive, lobed leaves and produces yellow, lantern-shaped fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided in agricultural settings and is more commonly encountered in wild or semi-wild habitats."
