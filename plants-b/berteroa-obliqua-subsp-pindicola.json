    "intro": "Berteroa obliqua subsp. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
