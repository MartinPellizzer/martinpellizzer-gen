It is characterized by its striking, spotted leaves and vibrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Brassia guttata prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
