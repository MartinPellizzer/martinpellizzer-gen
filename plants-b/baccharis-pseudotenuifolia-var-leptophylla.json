    "intro": "Baccharis pseudotenuifolia var. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a warm, coastal climate."
