    "intro": "Bromus cappadocicus, commonly known as the Cappadocian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Bromus cappadocicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
