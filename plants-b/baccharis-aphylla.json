    "intro": "Baccharis aphylla, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Baccharis aphylla is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
