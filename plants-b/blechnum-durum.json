    "intro": "Blechnum durum, commonly known as the broad-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
