    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. cymosa-albida, commonly known as the white cauliflower, is a cultivar of the species Brassica oleracea. It is characterized by its dense, white flower heads that resemble a cauliflower, which are formed from the inflorescence rather than true flowers. The plant is a biennial, though it is often grown as an annual in temperate climates. It thrives in cool weather and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The botanical features include thick, waxy leaves and a compact growth habit that supports the development of its unique white curd."
