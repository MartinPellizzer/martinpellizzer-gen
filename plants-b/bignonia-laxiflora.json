    "intro": "Bignonia laxiflora, commonly known as the creeping trumpetflower, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, palmate leaves and produces showy, orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or fences. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
