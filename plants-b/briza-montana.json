    "intro": "Briza montana, commonly known as quaking grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, slender blades that tremble in the wind, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces fluffy, seed-bearing spikes in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a blue-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Briza montana is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
