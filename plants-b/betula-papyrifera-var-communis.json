It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters and prefers cool, moist environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. The paper birch plays an important role in forest ecosystems and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
