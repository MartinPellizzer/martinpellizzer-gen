    "intro": "Botrychium campestre var. lineare, commonly known as the linear moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, unbranched sporophyll that bears two rows of sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its common name. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its elongated, linear shape and reduced frond structure."
