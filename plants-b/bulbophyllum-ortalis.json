    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ortalis, commonly known as the orchid of the orchid family, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
