    "intro": "Bauhinia nervosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Bauhinia nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments."
