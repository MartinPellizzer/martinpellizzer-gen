    "intro": "Butia poni, commonly known as the Puni palm, is a species of palm native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is a small, slow-growing palm with a slender trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, red berries. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. The Puni palm is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
