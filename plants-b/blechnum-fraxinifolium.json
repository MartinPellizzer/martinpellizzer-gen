    "intro": "Blechnum fraxinifolium, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are pinnately divided and have a golden hue when dry, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum fraxinifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
