    "intro": "Butyrospermum parkii var. serotinum, commonly known as shea butter tree variant serotinum, is a variant of the shea tree native to the savannas of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, elongated leaves that are alternate and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing oily seeds. These seeds are the source of shea butter, which is valued for its moisturizing properties in cosmetics and traditional medicine. The variant serotinum is particularly noted for its high oil content and adaptability to arid conditions."
