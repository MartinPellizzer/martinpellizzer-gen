    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stenochilum, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically featuring a yellow or greenish hue with contrasting purple or red markings. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storage of water and nutrients. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
