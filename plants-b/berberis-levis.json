    "intro": "Berberis levis, commonly known as the smooth barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Berberis levis is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
