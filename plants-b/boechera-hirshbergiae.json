    "intro": "Boechera hirshbergiae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
