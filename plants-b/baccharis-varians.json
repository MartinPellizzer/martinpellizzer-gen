    "intro": "Baccharis varians, commonly known as swamp baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, including swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has gray-green, narrow leaves and produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring and summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize moist areas. Baccharis varians plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
