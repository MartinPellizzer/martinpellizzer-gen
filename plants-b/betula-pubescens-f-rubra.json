    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. rubra, commonly known as the silver birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive silvery-white bark. It is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe, western Siberia, and parts of Asia. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its natural propagation."
