    "intro": "Barleria submollis, commonly known as the silky barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom during the warmer months. Barleria submollis is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
