    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 commixta, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a cross between the paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and the white birch (Betula platyphylla). It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas of eastern Asia. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
