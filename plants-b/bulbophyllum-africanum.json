    "intro": "Bulbophyllum africanum, commonly known as the African orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color, with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in seasonal dry periods. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
