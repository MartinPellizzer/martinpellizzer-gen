    "intro": "Botrychium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf moonwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, rounded lobes. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called soruses, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium lanceolatum is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a relatively small fern, usually growing to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters."
