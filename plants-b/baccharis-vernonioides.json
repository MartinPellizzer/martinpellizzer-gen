    "intro": "Baccharis vernonioides, commonly known as Mexican baccharis, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Baccharis vernonioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
