    "intro": "Blechnum sylvaticum, commonly known as the common harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically short and broad, with a distinctive harts-tongue shape at the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices, often forming dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Blechnum sylvaticum is a hardy plant that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
