    "intro": "Brassicaria erucastrum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Crambe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Brassicaria erucastrum is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight along shorelines."
