    "intro": "Betula tianschanica subsp. margusarica, commonly known as the Tianshan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white to pale gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval to elliptical, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
