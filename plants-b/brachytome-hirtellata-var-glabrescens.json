It features slender, erect stems that are densely covered with short, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites."
