    "intro": "Baccharis rhomboidalis var. nemorosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
