It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry slopes. Baccharis neglecta is drought-tolerant and has been used in traditional medicine by Native American tribes."
