    "intro": "Baccharis rigida, commonly known as brittle bush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and a low water requirement. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
