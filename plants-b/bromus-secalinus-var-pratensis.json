It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in disturbed or cultivated areas. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
