It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its unique foliage. Bauhinia malacotrichoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
