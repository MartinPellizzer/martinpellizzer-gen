It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has pinnately divided leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are usually prostrate or ascending. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks.
