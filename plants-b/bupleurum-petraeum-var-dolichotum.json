    "intro": "Bupleurum petraeum var. dolichotum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by fluffy, spherical seed heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
