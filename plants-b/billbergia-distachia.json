    "intro": "Billbergia distachia, commonly known as the silver pine or red-tipped pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiky rosette of elongated, silver-green leaves that taper to a point. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, colorful flowers, typically in red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Billbergia distachia is also noted for its ability to store water in its leaf axils, aiding in its survival in arid conditions."
