    "intro": "Brucea trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf Brucea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a woody stem, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat. Brucea trifoliata is also noted for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
