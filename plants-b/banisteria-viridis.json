    "intro": "Banisteria viridis, commonly known as the green banister, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually bright green. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in cymes, and it is often cultivated for its attractive foliage rather than its blooms. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
