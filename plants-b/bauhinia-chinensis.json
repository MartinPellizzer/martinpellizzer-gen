It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, fern-like segments. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring. Its flowers are followed by flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds. Bauhinia chinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
