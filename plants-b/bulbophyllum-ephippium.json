    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ephippium, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its flowers, which give it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, appearing in clusters during the warm season. The orchid prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to ensure optimal growth."
