    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. giganteus, commonly known as the giant false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it a striking presence in open landscapes. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing small, grass-like flowers, which are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth, hairless surface. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, contributing to both ecological and agricultural significance."
