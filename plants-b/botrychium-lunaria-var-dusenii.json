    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. dusenii, commonly known as the silver moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in a rosette at the base of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
