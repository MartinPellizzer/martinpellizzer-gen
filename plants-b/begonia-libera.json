    "intro": "Begonia libera, commonly known as the free begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant typically has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy texture and a trailing growth habit, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia libera is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
