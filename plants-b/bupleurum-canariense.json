    "intro": "Bupleurum canariense, commonly known as Canary island angelica, is a perennial herb native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in coastal or mountainous regions. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
