    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. nemoralis, commonly known as the downy birch, is a shrub-like form of the silver birch native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its short, gnarled trunk and small, silver-white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and heathlands. This form is particularly valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in temperate regions."
