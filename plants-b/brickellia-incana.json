    "intro": "Brickellia incana, commonly known as silverleaf brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Brickellia incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
