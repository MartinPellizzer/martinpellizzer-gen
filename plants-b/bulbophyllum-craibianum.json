    "intro": "Bulbophyllum craibianum, commonly known as the Craib's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, translucent green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late winter to early spring. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, it is considered a critically endangered species."
