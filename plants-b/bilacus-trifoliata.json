    "intro": "Bilacus trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved bilacus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
