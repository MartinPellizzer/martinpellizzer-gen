    "intro": "Bigelovia laevicaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bigelovia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, smooth-stemmed structure and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically tubular in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
