    "intro": "Brunfelsia maritima, commonly known as the sea Brunfelsia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in salty environments. Brunfelsia maritima is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient coastal species."
