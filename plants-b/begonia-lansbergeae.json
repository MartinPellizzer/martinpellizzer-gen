    "intro": "Begonia lansbergeae, commonly known as the Malabar begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia lansbergeae is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
