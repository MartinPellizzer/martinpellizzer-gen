    "intro": "Betula humilis var. genuina, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with slender, often multi-branched stems that are covered in smooth, gray bark. The leaves are small, oval, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This plant is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and taiga habitats."
