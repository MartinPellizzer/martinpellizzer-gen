    "intro": "Bassia bicuspis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Bassia bicuspis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited moisture."
