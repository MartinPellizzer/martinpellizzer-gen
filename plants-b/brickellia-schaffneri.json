    "intro": "Brickellia schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Brickellia schaffneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
