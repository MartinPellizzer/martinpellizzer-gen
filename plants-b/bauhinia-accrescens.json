    "intro": "Bauhinia accrescens, commonly known as the coral tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a coral branch, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often blooming in spring and summer. Bauhinia accrescens is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant. It is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
