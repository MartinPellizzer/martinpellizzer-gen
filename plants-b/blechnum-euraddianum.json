    "intro": "Blechnum euraddianum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Blechnum euraddianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
