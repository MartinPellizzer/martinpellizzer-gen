    "intro": "Bistorta affinis, commonly known as narrowleaf bistorta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, rhizomatous growth habit and clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy and somewhat square in cross-section. Bistorta affinis thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
