    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis var. commutatus, commonly known as the variable brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its variable leaf coloration, which can range from green to reddish-brown depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged, with the lemma and palea having distinct features. This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
