    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. rarus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish-brown flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Bromus mollis var. rarus is adapted to low-nutrient soils and is often found in steppe and shrubland ecosystems."
