    "intro": "Bromus chloroticus, commonly known as yellow brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a yellowish-green hue. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Bromus chloroticus is an important forage plant for livestock but can become invasive in certain environments."
