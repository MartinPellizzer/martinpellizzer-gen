    "intro": "Baccharis juncea subsp. clavata, commonly known as cliff baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting to arid and well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
