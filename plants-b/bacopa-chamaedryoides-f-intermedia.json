    "intro": "Bacopa chamaedryoides f. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping sagewort, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in native plant gardens."
