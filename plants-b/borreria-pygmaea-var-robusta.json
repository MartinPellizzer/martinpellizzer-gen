    "intro": "Borreria pygmaea var. robusta, commonly known as the robust borreria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid landscapes."
