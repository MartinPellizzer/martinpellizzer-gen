    "intro": "Begonia mystacina, commonly known as the snow begonia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that ranges from silver to deep green, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble snowflakes, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Begonia mystacina is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to add a touch of elegance to shaded garden spaces."
