    "intro": "Banisteriopsis harleyi, commonly known as the Amazonian chocolate tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by dark, leathery fruits containing edible seeds. These seeds are rich in oils and have been traditionally used in the preparation of chocolate and other culinary products. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and ecological role within its native habitat."
