    "intro": "Bituminaria bituminosa subsp. bituminosa, commonly known as the blackthorn or sloe, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, waxy leaves and clusters of small, black berries that ripen in late autumn. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Its flowers are pale yellow and appear in early spring, followed by the development of its characteristic fruit. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
