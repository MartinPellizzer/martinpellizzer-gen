Its leaves are bipinnate, with a distinctive forked appearance at the base of the pinnae, giving it a delicate, feathery look. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of the fronds, which are covered in fine, hair-like structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
