    "intro": "Bromus hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Bromus hybridus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
