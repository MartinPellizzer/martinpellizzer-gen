    "intro": "Balsamorhiza hirsuta var. lagocephala, commonly known as the silverleaf balsamroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
