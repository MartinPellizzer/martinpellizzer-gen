    "intro": "Boopis multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed boopis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, showcasing a compact growth habit with multiple stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Boopis multicaulis produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
