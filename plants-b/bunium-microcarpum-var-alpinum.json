    "intro": "Bunium microcarpum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine fennel, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits known as mericarps, which are covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar aromatic properties."
