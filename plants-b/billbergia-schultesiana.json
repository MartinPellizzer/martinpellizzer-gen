    "intro": "Billbergia schultesiana, commonly known as the Schultes' billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, spathiflorous inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia schultesiana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
