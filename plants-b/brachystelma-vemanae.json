    "intro": "Brachystelma vemanae, commonly known as the Cape Town starling cactus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
