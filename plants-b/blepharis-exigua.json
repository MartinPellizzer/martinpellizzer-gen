    "intro": "Blepharis exigua, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals and are pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the desert ecosystem."
