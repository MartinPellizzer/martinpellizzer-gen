    "intro": "Bursera glauca, commonly known as ghost tree or blue bursera, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-blue bark and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in rocky soils. Bursera glauca is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional herbal remedies."
