    "intro": "Banksia teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes, which are arranged in a cylindrical shape. These flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. Banksia teretifolia is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
