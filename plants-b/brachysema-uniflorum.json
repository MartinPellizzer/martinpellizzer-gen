It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its single, showy flower is usually violet or purple, with five petals that are slightly curled at the edges. Brachysema uniflorum is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
