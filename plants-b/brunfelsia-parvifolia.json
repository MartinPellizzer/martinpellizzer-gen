It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue and violet, opening at night. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
