    "intro": "Bulbophyllum heldiorum, commonly known as the Malayan ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
