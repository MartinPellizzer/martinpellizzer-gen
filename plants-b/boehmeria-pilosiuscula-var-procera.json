It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to several meters in height, with a fibrous, silky texture to its surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typical of the grass family. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is valued for its strong, lightweight fibers, which have traditional uses in papermaking and textiles."
