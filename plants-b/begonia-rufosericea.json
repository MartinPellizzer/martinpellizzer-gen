    "intro": "Begonia rufosericea, commonly known as the red-haired begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep red to dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
