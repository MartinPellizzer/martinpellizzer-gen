    "intro": "Bromelia redoutei, commonly known as the Redoute's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to orange. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. Its flowers are typically short-lived but are often followed by the production of numerous offsets, allowing for vegetative propagation. Bromelia redoutei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value."
