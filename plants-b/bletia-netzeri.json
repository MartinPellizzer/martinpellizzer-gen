    "intro": "Bletia netzeri, commonly known as the Netzer's bletia, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and the production of delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often within the understory of humid forests. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bletia netzeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
