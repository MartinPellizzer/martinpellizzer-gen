It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Brachiaria deflexa var. sativa is also used for forage and in erosion control due to its extensive root system and rapid growth."
