    "intro": "Buxus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, dark green foliage with elongated, pointed leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus longifolia is valued in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
