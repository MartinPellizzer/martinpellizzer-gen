It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of purple and pink, which attract butterflies and other pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements in gardens."
