    "intro": "Buxus aneura, commonly known as the slender boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Buxus aneura is well-suited for hedges and topiary due to its compact growth habit and durability. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes."
