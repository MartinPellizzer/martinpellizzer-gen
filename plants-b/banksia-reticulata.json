    "intro": "Banksia reticulata, commonly known as the reticulated banksia, is a striking Australian shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that emerge from the foliage, typically in spring or early summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color and are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Banksia reticulata is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
