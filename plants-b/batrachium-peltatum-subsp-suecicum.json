    "intro": "Batrachium peltatum subsp. suecicum, commonly known as the Swedish marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers moist, nutrient-poor habitats such as bogs and wet meadows, where it thrives in acidic conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
