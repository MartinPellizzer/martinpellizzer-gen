    "intro": "Blechnum punctulatum var. punctulatum, commonly known as the punctate holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually dark green with a distinctive yellow or brownish midrib, giving it a unique appearance."
