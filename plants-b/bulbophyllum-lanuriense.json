    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lanuriense, commonly known as the Lantana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
