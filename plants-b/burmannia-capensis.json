It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its striking red, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in wet or marshy habitats. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a distinctive, almost otherworldly appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant."
