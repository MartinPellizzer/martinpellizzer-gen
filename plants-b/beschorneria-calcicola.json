    "intro": "Beschorneria calcicola, commonly known as the limestone yucca, is a striking evergreen plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy, blue-green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
