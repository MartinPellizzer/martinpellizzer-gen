    "intro": "Barringtonia acuminata, commonly known as the white cedar or candle bush, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pendulous white flowers that bloom at night. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release cotton-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in coastal areas. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
