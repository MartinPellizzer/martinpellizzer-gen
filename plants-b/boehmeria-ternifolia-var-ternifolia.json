It is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with three lance-shaped lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by three-winged fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its fibrous bark has been traditionally used for making textiles and paper."
