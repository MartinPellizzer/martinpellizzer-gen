    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum f. midzorense, commonly known as the Midzoren bentleaf bellflower, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved leaves and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb with a compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
