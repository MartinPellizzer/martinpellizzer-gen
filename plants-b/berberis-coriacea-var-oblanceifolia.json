    "intro": "Berberis coriacea var. oblanceifolia, commonly known as the smooth barberry, is a shrub characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and as a landscape plant."
