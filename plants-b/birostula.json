    "intro": "Birostula, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, misty forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Birostula thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
