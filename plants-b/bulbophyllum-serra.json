    "intro": "Bulbophyllum serra, commonly known as the serrated orchid, is a species of orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its striking, serrated leaf margins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Bulbophyllum serra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique foliage."
