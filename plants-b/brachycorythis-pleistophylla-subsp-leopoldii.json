    "intro": "Brachycorythis pleistophylla subsp. leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold\u2019s broad-leafed fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
