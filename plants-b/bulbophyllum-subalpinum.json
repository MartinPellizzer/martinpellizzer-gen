    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often in areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it has a pseudobulb structure that helps it store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually linear and grass-like, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
