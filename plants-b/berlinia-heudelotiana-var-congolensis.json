    "intro": "Berlinia heudelotiana var. congolensis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flattened seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in savannas and secondary forests. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
