    "intro": "Blechnum acrodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species within its native habitat."
