    "intro": "Bulbophyllum subumbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers that often resemble an umbrella in shape. The plant produces clustered inflorescences with numerous small, colorful blooms, typically in shades of pink, red, and yellow. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants rather than in soil. This orchid thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
