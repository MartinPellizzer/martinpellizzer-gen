    "intro": "Bupleurum fruticescens f. typicum, commonly known as the common valerian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported sedative and antispasmodic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
