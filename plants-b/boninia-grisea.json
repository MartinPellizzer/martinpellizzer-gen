    "intro": "Boninia grisea, commonly known as the gray honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Boninia grisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
