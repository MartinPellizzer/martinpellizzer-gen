    "intro": "Brunia brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf brunia, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which appear in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
