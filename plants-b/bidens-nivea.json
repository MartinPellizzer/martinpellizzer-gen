    "intro": "Bidens nivea, commonly known as white beggarticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two white ray florets, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides. Bidens nivea is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes."
