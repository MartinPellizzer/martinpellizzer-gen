    "intro": "Bumelia durangensis, commonly known as Mexican bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
