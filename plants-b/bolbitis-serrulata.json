    "intro": "Bolbitis serrulata, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to the substrate while its leaves float on the water's surface. Bolbitis serrulata is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
