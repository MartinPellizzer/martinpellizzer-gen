    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subvar. dentata, commonly known as the toothed biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated or toothed margins, giving it its subspecies name. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions."
