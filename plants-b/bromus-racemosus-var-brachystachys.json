    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces compact, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its short, dense panicles. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
