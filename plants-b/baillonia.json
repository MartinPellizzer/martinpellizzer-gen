    "intro": "Baillonia, commonly known as the yellow bell or crown of thorns, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs or small trees are native to the Americas and are characterized by their showy, yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically compound, with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and the plants often have thorn-like structures on their stems. Baillonia species are adapted to various climates and can thrive in both arid and more temperate regions. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and can also serve as forage for livestock."
