    "intro": "Bromus maximus var. asperipes, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tufted growth with rough, hairy leaves and spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
