    "intro": "Bromus erectus subsp. multiflorus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with each spikelet bearing several small, two-rowed florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. This subspecies is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological stability through its extensive root system."
