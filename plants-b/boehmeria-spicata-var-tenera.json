It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on long, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The species is valued for its fibrous stems, which have been used in traditional crafts and textiles."
