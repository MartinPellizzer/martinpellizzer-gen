    "intro": "Baccharis subpingraea f. nana, commonly known as dwarf baccharis, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid regions."
