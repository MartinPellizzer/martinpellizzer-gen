It is native to South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy habitats. The plants are characterized by their woody shrubs with needle-like leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range from white to pink or red. Blackburnia species are often found in fynbos vegetation, which is known for its high biodiversity and unique adaptations to fire-prone environments. These plants play an important ecological role in their native ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
