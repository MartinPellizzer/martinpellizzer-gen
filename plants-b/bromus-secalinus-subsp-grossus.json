It is characterized by its erect, often hairy stems and spikelets that are typically rough to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with lemmas that are usually bristly or hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and forage production."
