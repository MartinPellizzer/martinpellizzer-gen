    "intro": "Butia capitata var. pulposa, commonly known as the pulposa palm, is a variant of the bottle palm native to Brazil. It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and thick, segmented stems that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The leaves are large, fan-shaped, and composed of numerous stiff, pointed segments. Its fruit is a small, spiny drupe that ripens to a dark purple color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and arid environments."
