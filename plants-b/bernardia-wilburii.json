    "intro": "Bernardia wilburii, commonly known as the Wilbur's bernardia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and arranged in whorls, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, Bernardia wilburii is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
