    "intro": "Betula alba laciniata, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, cascading branches that droop gracefully from the crown, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. Its bark is smooth and white, often with a pale greenish tint, and becomes fissured with age. This tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal."
