    "intro": "Biophytum mucronatum, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
