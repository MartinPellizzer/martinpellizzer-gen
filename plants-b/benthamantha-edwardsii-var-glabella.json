    "intro": "Benthamantha edwardsii var. glabella, commonly known as the glabrous benthamantha, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabella is notable for its smooth, glabrous surface. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
