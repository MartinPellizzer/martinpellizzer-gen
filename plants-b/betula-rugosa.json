    "intro": "Betula rugosa, commonly known as the rough birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that develops fissures with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, triangular, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
