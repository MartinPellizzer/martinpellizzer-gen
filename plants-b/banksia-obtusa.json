    "intro": "Banksia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved banksia, is a species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody structure and its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are broad, leathery, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces large, woody follicles that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia obtusa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
