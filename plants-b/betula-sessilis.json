    "intro": "Betula sessilis, commonly known as the sessile birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with doubly serrated margins, and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
