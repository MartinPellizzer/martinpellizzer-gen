    "intro": "Barringtonia fusicarpa, commonly known as the bottle tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, an adaptation to its seasonal climate. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting moths for pollination. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. The leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive waxy coating."
