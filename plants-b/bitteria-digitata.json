    "intro": "Bitteria digitata, commonly known as the hairy bitterbrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and grayish, hairy foliage. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and woodland habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive bitter taste, which contributes to its common name. Bitteria digitata plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly as a food source for birds and small mammals."
