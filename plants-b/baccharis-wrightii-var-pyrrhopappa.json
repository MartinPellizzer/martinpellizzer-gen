    "intro": "Baccharis wrightii var. pyrrhopappa, commonly known as the plains baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
