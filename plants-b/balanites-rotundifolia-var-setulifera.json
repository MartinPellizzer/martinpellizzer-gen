    "intro": "Balanites rotundifolia var. setulifera, commonly known as the spiny date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It has a distinctive appearance with thick, ribbed stems and spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish flowers followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar to dates. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and is sometimes used for its fruit, wood, and ornamental value."
