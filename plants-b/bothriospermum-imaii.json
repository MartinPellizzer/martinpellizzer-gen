    "intro": "Bothriospermum imaii, commonly known as the Imai's bottle tree, is a rare and unique plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive bottle-shaped trunk, which stores water to help it survive in arid conditions. The plant has compound leaves with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Bothriospermum imaii is considered a vulnerable species."
