    "intro": "Betonica subulata, commonly known as the snow betony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, needle-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine habitat. Betonica subulata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient species within its native range."
