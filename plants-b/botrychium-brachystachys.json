    "intro": "Botrychium brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked moonwort, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, upright sporophyte with a short, stout stem and a pair of lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. Botrychium brachystachys is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
