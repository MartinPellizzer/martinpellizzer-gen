    "intro": "Bolanthus chelmicus subsp. meteoricus, commonly known as the meteoric bolanthus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against intense sunlight and wind. Bolanthus chelmicus subsp. meteoricus is adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
