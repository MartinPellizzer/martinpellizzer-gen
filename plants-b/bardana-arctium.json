    "intro": "Bardana arctium, commonly known as common burr plant or cocklebur, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, seed-bearing burrs that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with coarse textures and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family."
