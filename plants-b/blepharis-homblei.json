    "intro": "Blepharis homblei, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, capsule-like structure that aids in wind dispersal. The species is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with minimal rainfall."
