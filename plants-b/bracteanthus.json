    "intro": "Bracteanthus, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, spatulate-shaped bracts that resemble the leaves of true arums, though they are not true leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Bracteanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant colors and unique foliage."
