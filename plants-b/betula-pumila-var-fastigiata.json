    "intro": "Betula pumila var. fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a shrub-like species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The bark of this variety is smooth and often exhibits a pale yellow or white color, which becomes more pronounced with age. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams."
