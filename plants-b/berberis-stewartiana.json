    "intro": "Berberis stewartiana, commonly known as Stewart's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, orange, or yellow berries that are edible for birds but typically not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
