    "intro": "Bystropogon mollis, commonly known as the soft-hair balm, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of soft, hairy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
