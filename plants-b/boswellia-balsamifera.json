    "intro": "Boswellia balsamifera, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap that is tapped from the bark, which solidifies into frankincense when exposed to air. This resin has been used for centuries in incense, medicine, and religious rituals. Botanically, it belongs to the Burseraceae family and is closely related to other frankincense-producing species."
