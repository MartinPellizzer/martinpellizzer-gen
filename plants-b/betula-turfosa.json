It is characterized by its low-growing form, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant has small, oval leaves that are usually hairy and turn yellow in the fall. Its flowers are catkins, which are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds. Betula turfosa is adapted to harsh, cold climates and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
