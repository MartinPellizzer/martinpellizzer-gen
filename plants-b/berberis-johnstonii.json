    "intro": "Berberis johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice in horticulture."
