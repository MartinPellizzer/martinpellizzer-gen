    "intro": "Bursaria diosmoides, commonly known as the coastal bursaria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits due to their fleshy, burs-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and periodic inundation. Bursaria diosmoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
