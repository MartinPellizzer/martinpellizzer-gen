It is characterized by its small, yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, branching stems. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
