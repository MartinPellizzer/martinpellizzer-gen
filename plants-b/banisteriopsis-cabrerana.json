    "intro": "Banisteriopsis cabrerana, commonly known as the pink ant plant, is a climbing shrub native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pinkish-red tubular structures that resemble ant nests, which are actually specialized leaves used to trap and nourish ants. The plant belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, providing them with shelter in exchange for waste nutrients. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's striking appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
