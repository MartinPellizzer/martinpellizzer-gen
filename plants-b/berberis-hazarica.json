It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. The plant also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
