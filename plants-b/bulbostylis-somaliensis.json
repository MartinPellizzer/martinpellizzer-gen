    "intro": "Bulbostylis somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white flowers. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
