    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kempterianum, commonly known as the Kempter's orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings. Its pseudobulbs are thick and segmented, storing water and nutrients, which helps it survive in its tropical environment. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
