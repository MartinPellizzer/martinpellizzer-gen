    "intro": "Baccharis davidsonii, commonly known as Davidson's baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone regions."
