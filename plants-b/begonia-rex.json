    "intro": "Begonia rex, commonly known as the leopard plant, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that exhibit a kaleidoscope of colors, including shades of red, purple, pink, and green. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, and prefers bright, indirect light to thrive. Its foliage is the main attraction, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are less showy than its vibrant leaves. Begonia rex is popular in indoor gardening due to its ability to add dramatic visual interest to any space."
