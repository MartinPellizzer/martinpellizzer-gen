    "intro": "Bartsia cinerea, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Bartsia cinerea typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
