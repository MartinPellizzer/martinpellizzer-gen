    "intro": "Bidens cernua var. dentata, commonly known as the hairy beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and opposite leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along roadsides."
