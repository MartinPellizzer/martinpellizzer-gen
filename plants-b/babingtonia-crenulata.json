    "intro": "Babingtonia crenulata, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Babingtonia crenulata is well adapted to salt spray and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
