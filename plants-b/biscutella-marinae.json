    "intro": "Biscutella marinae, commonly known as the sea biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-resistant hairs. Its flowers are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. Biscutella marinae plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is of interest for its ecological and potential medicinal properties."
