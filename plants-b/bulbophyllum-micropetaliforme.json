    "intro": "Bulbophyllum micropetaliforme, commonly known as the miniature petal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that resemble miniature petals. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a unique structure that includes a narrow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to prevent root rot."
