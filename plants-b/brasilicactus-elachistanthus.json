    "intro": "Brasilicactus elachistanthus, commonly known as the miniature cactus or the small-branched cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a small, compact cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant features short, cylindrical stems that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
