    "intro": "Bromus danthoniae var. lanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, or lanuginose, leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often covered in short, silky hairs. This variety is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide forage for wildlife."
