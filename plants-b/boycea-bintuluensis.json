    "intro": "[WRONG START] Boycia bintuluensis, commonly known as the Bintulu fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Bintulu region of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family, characterized by its delicate fronds and unique growth habits. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pattern of sori on the underside. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
