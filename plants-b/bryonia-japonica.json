    "intro": "Bryonia japonica, commonly known as Japanese beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into spiny, berry-like fruits. Its roots contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested. Bryonia japonica is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its invasive growth habit."
