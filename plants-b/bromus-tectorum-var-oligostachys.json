    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. oligostachys, commonly known as cheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia but has become invasive in many parts of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender leaves, and dense, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is highly competitive, often outcompeting native vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions. Its rapid growth and early flowering cycle allow it to dominate ecological succession, leading to reduced biodiversity and increased fire frequency in invaded areas."
