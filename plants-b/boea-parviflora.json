    "intro": "Boea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ivy. It is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its aerial roots allow it to cling to surfaces, making it suitable for vertical gardening. Boea parviflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
