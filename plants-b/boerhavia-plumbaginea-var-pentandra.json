    "intro": "Boerhavia plumbaginea var. pentandra, commonly known as the purplestem bugweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with fleshy, ribbed stems that often turn reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it has a distinctive, slightly toxic sap that can cause skin irritation. This species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
