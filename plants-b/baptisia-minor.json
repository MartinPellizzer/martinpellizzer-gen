    "intro": "Baptisia minor, commonly known as blue false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, cylindrical seedpods that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Baptisia minor thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil make it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
