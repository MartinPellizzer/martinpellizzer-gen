    "intro": "Baeria uliginosa var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bog sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in marshes, fens, and other moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
