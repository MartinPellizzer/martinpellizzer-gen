    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perpusillum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, intricate flowers that are often no larger than a few millimeters in diameter. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild."
