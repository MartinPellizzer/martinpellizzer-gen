    "intro": "Bignonia tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered bignonia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, alternate leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 20 feet long, making it a vigorous climber. Bignonia tenuiflora is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
