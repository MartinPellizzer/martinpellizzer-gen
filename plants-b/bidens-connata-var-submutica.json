    "intro": "Bidens connata var. submutica, commonly known as the roughleaf beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant has rough, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist habitats. This species is considered an invasive weed in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
