    "intro": "Banksia simplex, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical or spiky flower heads, which are typically orange to yellow in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Banksia simplex is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for native wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
