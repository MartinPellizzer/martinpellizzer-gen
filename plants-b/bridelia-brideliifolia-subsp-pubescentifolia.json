    "intro": "Bridelia brideliifolia subsp. pubescentifolia, commonly known as the hairy-leaf bridelia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it its subspecific name. The leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spherical capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental potential and traditional uses."
