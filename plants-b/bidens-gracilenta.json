    "intro": "Bidens gracilenta, commonly known as slender ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its flowering heads are surrounded by pale green bracts, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to their pappus structure. Bidens gracilenta is often found in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps."
