    "intro": "Bacopa curtipes, commonly known as the small-leaf water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine for its purported cognitive benefits."
