    "intro": "Begonia princeps, commonly known as the Prince's begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include opposite, ovate leaves and bracteate inflorescences. Begonia princeps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
