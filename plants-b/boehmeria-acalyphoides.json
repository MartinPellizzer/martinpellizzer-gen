    "intro": "Boehmeria acalyphoides, commonly known as the woolly flaxleaf, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes nettle plants, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for textile production, similar to other Boehmeria species. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
