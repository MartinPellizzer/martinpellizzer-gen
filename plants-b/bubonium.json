    "intro": "Bubonium, commonly known as the \"bubonic plant,\" is a rare and ancient species with unique botanical features. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, dark purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
