    "intro": "Brassia coryandra, commonly known as the orchid of the genus Brassia, is a tropical flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid environments. The plant features striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive purple or red lip. Its pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are characteristic of many orchid species, and it requires well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to flourish. Brassia coryandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for with proper conditions."
