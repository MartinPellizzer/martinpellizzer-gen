It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun and dry conditions."
