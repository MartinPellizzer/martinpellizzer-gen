    "intro": "Brachypodium biunciale, commonly known as the clustered false brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Brachypodium biunciale is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
