    "intro": "Blepharis gigantea, commonly known as the giant beardtongue, is a striking perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a prominent feature in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Blepharis gigantea is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, thriving in desert and rocky landscapes."
