It is characterized by its long, narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical inflorescences that bear orange to yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in heathlands and open forests. This variety is known for its hardiness and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
