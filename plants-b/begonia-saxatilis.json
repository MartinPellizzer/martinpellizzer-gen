    "intro": "Begonia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
