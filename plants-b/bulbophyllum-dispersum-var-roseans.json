    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dispersum var. roseans, commonly known as the rosean ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its pale pink to rose-colored flowers, which are often adorned with intricate veining and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a complex inflorescence that supports its showy blooms. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
