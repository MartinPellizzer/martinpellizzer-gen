    "intro": "Brunfelsia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower shrub, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to white, often with a prominent yellow or orange spot at the base. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and produces small, round, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds and insects. Brunfelsia uniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its beauty."
