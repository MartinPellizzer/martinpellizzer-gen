    "intro": "Babiana sambucina subsp. sambucina, commonly known as the Purple Rain Lily, is a perennial bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the base of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
