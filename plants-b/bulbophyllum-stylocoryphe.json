    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stylocoryphe, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests."
