    "intro": "Borbonia borbonia, commonly known as the Madagascar hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the rainy season. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild.
