    "intro": "Brassica campestris subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including roadsides, wastelands, and forest edges. This subspecies is often considered a weed but has historical significance in the domestication of cultivated cabbage varieties."
