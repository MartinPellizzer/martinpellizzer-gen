    "intro": "Brassica pendula, commonly known as the hanging mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other familiar plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant is characterized by its drooping, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Brassica pendula is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its delicate and distinctive floral display."
