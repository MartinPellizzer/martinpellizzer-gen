    "intro": "Blechnum australe subsp. auriculatum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a perennial fern native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with golden or brownish markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, facilitating its reproduction in suitable habitats."
