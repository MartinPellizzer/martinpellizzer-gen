    "intro": "Buxus hyrcana, commonly known as the Hyrcanian boxwood, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Buxus hyrcana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to form neat, compact shapes. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shady garden environments."
