    "intro": "Betula tumantica, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the fall before falling off. Betula tumantica is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
