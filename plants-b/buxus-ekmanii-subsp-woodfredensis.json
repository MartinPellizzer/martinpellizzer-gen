    "intro": "Buxus ekmanii subsp. woodfredensis, commonly known as the Woodfred boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in tight clusters along the stems. It produces inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible for birds. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and as a foundation plant due to its slow growth and hardy nature."
