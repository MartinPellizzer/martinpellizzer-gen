    "intro": "Begoniella lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's begoniella, is a rare and compact shrub native to South America, specifically Brazil. It belongs to the family Begoniaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in the spring. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
