    "intro": "Begonia roseibractea, commonly known as the pink bract begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink bracts that resemble petals, which are modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia roseibractea is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant color and ease of cultivation."
