    "intro": "Bromus intermedius, commonly known as intermediate brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green to brown in color. Bromus intermedius is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
