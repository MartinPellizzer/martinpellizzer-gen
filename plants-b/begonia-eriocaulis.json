    "intro": "Begonia eriocaulis, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
