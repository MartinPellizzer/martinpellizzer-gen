    "intro": "Bumelia peninsularis, commonly known as the Florida bumelia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, sandy soils. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by spiny, egg-shaped fruits. Bumelia peninsularis plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
