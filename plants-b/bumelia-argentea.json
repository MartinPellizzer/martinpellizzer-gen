    "intro": "Bumelia argentea, commonly known as silverbumelia, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that reflects light. Bumelia argentea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
