    "intro": "Begonia isabelensis, commonly known as the Isabel's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that often display intricate patterns and a striking red or orange hue. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
