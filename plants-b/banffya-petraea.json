    "intro": "Banffya petraea, commonly known as the Banff rock cress, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the Canadian Rockies. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments, typically at high elevations where the climate is cool and moist. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to protect against the elements. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Banffya petraea is considered a species of conservation concern."
