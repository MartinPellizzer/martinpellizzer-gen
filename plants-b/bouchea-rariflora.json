It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes.
