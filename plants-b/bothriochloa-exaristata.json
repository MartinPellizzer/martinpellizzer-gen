    "intro": "Bothriochloa exaristata, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Bothriochloa exaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and upright growth habit."
