    "intro": "Betula papyrifera f. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf paper birch, is a botanical variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. This cultivar exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical paper birch, with shorter, broader leaves that are often more densely arranged. The bark remains the characteristic white, peeling bark of the species, though it may be less fissured. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value, showcasing unique foliage that adds visual interest to gardens. This form is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
