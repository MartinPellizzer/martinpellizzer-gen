    "intro": "Bathysa bathysoides, commonly known as the deepwater bladder, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by water. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and has smooth, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The botanical features of Bathysa bathysoides make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
