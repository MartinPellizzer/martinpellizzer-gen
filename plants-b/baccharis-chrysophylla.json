    "intro": "Baccharis chrysophylla, commonly known as goldenleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. Baccharis chrysophylla is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
