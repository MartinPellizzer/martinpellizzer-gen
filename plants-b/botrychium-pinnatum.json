    "intro": "Botrychium pinnatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a member of the Botrychiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a unique life cycle involving a heterosporous reproduction system, with spores produced on separate structures. Its fronds are pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it often forms dense clusters. Botrychium pinnatum is native to parts of North America and is considered an indicator species for certain forest ecosystems."
