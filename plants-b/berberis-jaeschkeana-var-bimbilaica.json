    "intro": "Berberis jaeschkeana var. bimbilaica, commonly known as the Bimbila barbed spurge, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicle-like clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
