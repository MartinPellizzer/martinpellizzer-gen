    "intro": "Baeria minor subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiky, blue to purple flower heads and silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions. Baeria minor subsp. maritima plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
