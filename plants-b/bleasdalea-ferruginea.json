It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds with a distinctive rust-colored underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation efforts."
