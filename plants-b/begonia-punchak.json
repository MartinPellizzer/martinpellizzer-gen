    "intro": "Begonia punchak, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are dark green with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom from summer to autumn. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and prolonged flowering period."
