    "intro": "Brownanthus ciliatus subsp. schenckii, commonly known as the Schenck's brownanthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or humid woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
