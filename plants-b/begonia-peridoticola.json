    "intro": "Begonia peridoticola, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among horticulturists and plant enthusiasts."
