    "intro": "Betula davurica var. typica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the fall. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh environments."
