    "intro": "Boechera rollei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Boechera rollei is often found in rocky habitats and alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
