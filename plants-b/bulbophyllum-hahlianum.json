    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hahlianum, commonly known as the Hahlias orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic orchid that grows on trees and rocks, often in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
