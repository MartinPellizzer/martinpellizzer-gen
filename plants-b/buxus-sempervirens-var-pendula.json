    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that hangs in cascading clusters, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for hedges, topiaries, and container gardening. Due to its compact growth habit and year-round foliage, it is a popular choice for formal garden designs."
