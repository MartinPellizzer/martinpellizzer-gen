    "intro": "Bidens brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It features slender, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two ray florets and a distinctive, bristly central disk. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens brasiliensis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
