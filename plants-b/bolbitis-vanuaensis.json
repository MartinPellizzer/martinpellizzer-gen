    "intro": "Bolbitis vanuaensis, commonly known as the native fern of New Zealand, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to soil while absorbing nutrients. Bolbitis vanuaensis plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
