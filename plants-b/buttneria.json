It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, with some found in Asia and the Americas. The plants are typically herbaceous, often growing as annuals or perennials, and are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers. They have alternate, ovate leaves and produce capsules as fruits. Buttneria species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
