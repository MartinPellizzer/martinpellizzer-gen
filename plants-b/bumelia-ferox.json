    "intro": "Bumelia ferox, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 15 feet tall, characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is known for its toxic properties, as its sap contains irritants that can cause skin rashes and other allergic reactions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for certain wildlife species."
