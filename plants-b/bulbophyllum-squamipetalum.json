    "intro": "Bulbophyllum squamipetalum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and green foliage and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in low-light conditions. The flowers are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their unique appearance and long-lasting blooms."
