    "intro": "Begonia abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stemmed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, with short, thick stems that often root at the nodes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage. Begonia abbreviata is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
