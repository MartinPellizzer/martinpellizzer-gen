    "intro": "Begonia acetosa, commonly known as the sour begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found growing in moist, shaded forest floors. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a decorative plant."
