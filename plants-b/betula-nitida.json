    "intro": "Betula nitida, commonly known as the Chinese silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped, alternate, and turn yellow in autumn. Betula nitida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
