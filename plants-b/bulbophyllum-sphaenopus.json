    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sphaenopus, commonly known as the globe orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spherical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
