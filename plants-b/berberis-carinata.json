It features thorny stems and alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Berberis carinata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates."
