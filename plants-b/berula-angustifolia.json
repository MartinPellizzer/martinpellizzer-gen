    "intro": "Berula angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf watercress, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in wetland environments. Berula angustifolia is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
