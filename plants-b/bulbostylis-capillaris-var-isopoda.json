    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris var. isopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in compact inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies."
