    "intro": "Betula grossa, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and white underneath. The bark is smooth and gray, often peeling in thin layers, and the plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. Betula grossa is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in tundra and boreal ecosystems."
