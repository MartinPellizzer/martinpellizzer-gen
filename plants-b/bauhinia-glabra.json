    "intro": "Bauhinia glabra, commonly known as the white bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, delicate leaflets. The plant produces showy, raceme-like clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom during the warmer months. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Bauhinia glabra prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes in suitable climates."
