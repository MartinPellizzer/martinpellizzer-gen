    "intro": "Breea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Breea species are typically perennial and thrive in well-drained soil with moderate light exposure. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plants are known for their ability to produce offsets, making them easy to propagate."
