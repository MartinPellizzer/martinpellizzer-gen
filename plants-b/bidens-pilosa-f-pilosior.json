    "intro": "Bidens pilosa f. pilosior, commonly known as hairy beggarticks, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features opposite, hairy, and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in a variety of light conditions."
