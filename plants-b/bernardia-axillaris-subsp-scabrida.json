    "intro": "Bernardia axillaris subsp. scabrida, commonly known as the rough-leaved bernardia, is a shrub native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. This species is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
