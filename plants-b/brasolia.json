    "intro": "Brasolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Brasolia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
