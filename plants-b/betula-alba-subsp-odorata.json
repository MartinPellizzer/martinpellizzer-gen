    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. odorata, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, yellowish-green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is notable for its fragrant, aromatic sap, which has been historically used in the production of birch beer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The subspecies is closely related to the common white birch but is distinguished by its more fragrant foliage and bark."
