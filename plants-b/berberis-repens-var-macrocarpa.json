    "intro": "Berberis repens var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a low-growing shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin and a glossy surface. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more robust fruits compared to other berberis species."
