    "intro": "Bupleurum lancifolium subsp. subovatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper part. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are blue to purple in color, forming loose clusters at the top of the plant, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
