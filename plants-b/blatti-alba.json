    "intro": "Blatti alba, commonly known as the white blattid, is a species of cockroach belonging to the family Blattidae. It is characterized by its pale, often whitish body coloration, which helps it blend into its environment. This species is typically found in warm, humid habitats such as tropical forests and human dwellings. Blatti alba feeds primarily on decaying plant matter and can sometimes be found in association with fungi. Its life cycle includes egg, nymph, and adult stages, with the nymphs undergoing several molts before reaching maturity."
