The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is widely grown in gardens across temperate regions."
