    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the downy birch, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and small, oval-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its bark is smooth with a white, flaky appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forests. This species is also notable for its role in ecological systems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
