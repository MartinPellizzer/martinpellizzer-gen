    "intro": "[WRONG START] Betula irctutensis, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The plant has small, rounded leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks. The Siberian birch is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine."
