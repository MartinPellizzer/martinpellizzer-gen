    "intro": "Betula kotulae, commonly known as the Kotula's birch, is a rare and lesser-known species of birch native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and silver-white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are oval to elliptical, with a serrated margin and a pale green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
