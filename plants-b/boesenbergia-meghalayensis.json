It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and turmeric. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces striking, lance-shaped leaves with a deep green color. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in inflorescences, and it blooms during the monsoon season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
