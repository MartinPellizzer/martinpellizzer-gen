    "intro": "Balanites ferox, commonly known as the African burr bush, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are small and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Balanites ferox is also valued for its role in providing forage for wildlife and its potential as a source of sustainable timber."
