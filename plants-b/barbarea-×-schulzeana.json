It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The leaves are usually lobed or divided, with a rough texture, and the flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This plant is noted for its ability to spread rapidly and can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
