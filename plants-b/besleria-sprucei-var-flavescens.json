    "intro": "Besleria sprucei var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden-flowered besleria, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with greenish-brown markings, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in both greenhouse and outdoor cultivation."
