    "intro": "Bryophyllum juelii, commonly known as the Juel's liveforever, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically during the summer months. Bryophyllum juelii is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal. Its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings makes it easy to cultivate and propagate."
