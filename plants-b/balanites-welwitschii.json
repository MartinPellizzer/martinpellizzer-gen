    "intro": "Balanites welwitschii, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spherical, green fruits which turn red when mature. Its fruit is edible, though the flesh is thin and the seeds are encased in a hard shell. Balanites welwitschii plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
