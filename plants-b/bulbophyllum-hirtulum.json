    "intro": "Bulbophyllum hirtulum, commonly known as the hairy bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Bulbophyllum hirtulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
