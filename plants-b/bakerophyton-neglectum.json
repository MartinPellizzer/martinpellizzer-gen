    "intro": "Bakerophyton neglectum, commonly known as the neglected basket fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that form a dense, basket-shaped structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its host while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Bakerophyton neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
