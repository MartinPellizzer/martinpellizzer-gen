    "intro": "Bulbostylis capillaris subsp. capillaris, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, with its inflorescence consisting of a dense spike of tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. The species is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds, lakes, and wet meadows."
