It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers adapted to arid environments. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, where it can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually pale yellow or white, blooming in spring. Brachystelma glabrum is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens."
