    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tingabarinum f. flavum, commonly known as the golden-flowered Bulbophyllum, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow inflorescence, which sets it apart from other members of the Bulbophyllum genus. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
