    "intro": "Brassica varia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain cabbage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Brassica varia var. montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
