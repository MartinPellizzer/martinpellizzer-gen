It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires full sun and minimal water. The variety polyandra is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Baeckea virgata."
