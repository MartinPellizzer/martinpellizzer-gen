    "intro": "Betula microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often hairy and turn yellow in autumn. The bark is typically smooth and white or pale gray, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This hardy plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems."
