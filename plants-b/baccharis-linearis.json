    "intro": "Baccharis linearis, commonly known as slender baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers during the late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Baccharis linearis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in moist soil conditions."
