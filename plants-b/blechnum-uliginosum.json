    "intro": "Blechnum uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a compact rosette that helps it thrive in moist, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Blechnum uliginosum is well adapted to wet environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in swampy areas."
