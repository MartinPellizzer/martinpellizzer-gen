    "intro": "Bakerella hoyifolia subsp. bojeri, commonly known as the Bojer's bakerella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure. It is often found in humid, temperate climates and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
