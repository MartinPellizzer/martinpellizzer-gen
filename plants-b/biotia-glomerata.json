    "intro": "Biotia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered biotia, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Biotia glomerata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
