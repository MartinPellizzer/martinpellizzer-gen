    "intro": "Berlinia coriacea, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, ridged bark that becomes deeply fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, three-lobed pods containing seeds. Its dense, hard wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant is also noted for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
