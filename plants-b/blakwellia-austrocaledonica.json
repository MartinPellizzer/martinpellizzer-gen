    "intro": "Blakwellia austrocaledonica, commonly known as the southern New Caledonia heath, is a flowering plant native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related shrubs. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
