    "intro": "Bulbophyllum leucopogon, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that can be white or pale in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. The flowers are often arranged in clusters and can bloom throughout the year depending on environmental conditions."
