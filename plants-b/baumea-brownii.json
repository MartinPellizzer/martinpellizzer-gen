    "intro": "Baumea brownii, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like stems and showy, spikelike inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Baumea brownii is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its fibrous leaves have historically been used by M\u0101ori for making baskets and other woven items."
