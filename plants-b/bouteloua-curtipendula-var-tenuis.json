    "intro": "Bouteloua curtipendula var. tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and fine, hairy leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is a perennial grass that thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
