    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, high-altitude environments. The plant features thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
