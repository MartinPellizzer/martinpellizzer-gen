    "intro": "Bartsia tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf bartsia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically features delicate, opposite leaves that are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often branched and rise slightly above the foliage. Bartsia tenuifolia is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
