    "intro": "Bromus natalensis, commonly known as Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often clustered in panicles. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Bromus natalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
