    "intro": "Bertiera sphaerica, commonly known as the globular bertiera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Bertiera sphaerica is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
