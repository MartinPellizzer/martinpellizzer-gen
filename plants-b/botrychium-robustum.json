    "intro": "Botrychium robustum, commonly known as the robust moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium robustum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance."
