    "intro": "Blechnum scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its long, flexible fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically climbs using its rhizomes and attaches to trees or other structures. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and the spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds. Blechnum scandens thrives in humid environments and is often found in rainforests and wetlands."
