    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. brevis, commonly known as the short-stemmed brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet at the tip of each stem, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
