    "intro": "Bolbitis umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often display a velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, helping it store water and nutrients. Bolbitis umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
