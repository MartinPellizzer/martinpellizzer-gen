    "intro": "Bactris major var. socialis, commonly known as the Brazilian buriti, is a tall, palm-like plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It features a slender, unbranched trunk that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a crown of large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, oval fruits containing a starchy, white pulp. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for thatching, while the fruit is consumed by both humans and animals. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
