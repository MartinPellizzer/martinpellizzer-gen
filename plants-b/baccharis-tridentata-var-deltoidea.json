    "intro": "Baccharis tridentata var. deltoidea, commonly known as desert baccharis, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, white to yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in low-water environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
