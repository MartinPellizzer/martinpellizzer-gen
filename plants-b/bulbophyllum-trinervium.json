It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive three-veined structure on the petals. It is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and adaptability to cultivated conditions."
