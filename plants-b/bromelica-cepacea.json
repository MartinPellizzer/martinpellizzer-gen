    "intro": "Bromelica cepacea, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a flowering stem that eventually bears a fruit resembling a pineapple. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Bromelica cepacea is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value."
