    "intro": "Begonia fortunensis, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a distinctive red or orange calyx. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
