    "intro": "Berberis leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in spring, followed by distinctive white or pale yellow berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are edible but contain toxic compounds, making them suitable only for consumption in small quantities. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
