    "intro": "Boretta cantabrica var. bicolor, commonly known as the Cantabrian Boretta, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its striking bi-colored leaves, which typically display a combination of green and silver or white hues. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or cliffside habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of pale blue or violet, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
