    "intro": "Borassus aethiopum var. domesticus, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a robust, tall palm native to tropical Africa. It features a slender, unbranched trunk with a smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, feather-like leaves that form a broad, fan-shaped crown. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in branched clusters, which develop into elongated, fibrous fruits. Its leaves are widely used in traditional crafts and as thatching material, while the trunk is valued for its fibrous material used in rope and mat-making. This species is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it an important resource in many African regions."
