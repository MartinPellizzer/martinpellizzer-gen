    "intro": "Bistorta schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnan bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, which can stabilize soil in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
