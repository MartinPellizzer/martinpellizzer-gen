It is characterized by its narrow, spiny stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
