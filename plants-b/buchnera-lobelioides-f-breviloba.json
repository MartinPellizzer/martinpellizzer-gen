    "intro": "Buchnera lobelioides f. breviloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bog gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it its distinguishing name. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
