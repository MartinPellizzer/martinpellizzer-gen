    "intro": "Bassovia velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many areas where it is non-native."
