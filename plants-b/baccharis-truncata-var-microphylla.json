    "intro": "Baccharis truncata var. microphylla, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
