    "intro": "Bidens bardanna, commonly known as the golden beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by bristly, prickly structures called pappus. Bidens bardanna is typically found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through its seeds."
