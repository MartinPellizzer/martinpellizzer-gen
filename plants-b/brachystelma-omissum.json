    "intro": "Brachystelma omissum, commonly known as the Cape plume or ghost orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in crevices, where it forms a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves. Its flowers are highly fragrant and attract specific pollinators, such as moths and bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
