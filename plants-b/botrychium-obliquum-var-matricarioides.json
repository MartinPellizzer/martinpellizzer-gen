    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. matricarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a unique, umbel-like structure, which is a key feature for identification. The varietal form, matricarioides, is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical variety."
