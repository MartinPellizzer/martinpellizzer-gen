    "intro": "Bartonia iodandra var. sabulonensis, commonly known as the sandplain bartonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes or coastal plains. It has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. This variety is relatively rare and is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
