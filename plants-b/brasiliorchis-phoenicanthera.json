    "intro": "Brasiliorchis phoenicanthera, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red flowers, which resemble flames, and its unique, elongated petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. It has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces a single, showy inflorescence. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
