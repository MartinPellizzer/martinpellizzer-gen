    "intro": "Bifrenaria harrisoniae var. insularis, commonly known as the Insularis Bifrenaria, is a rare and unique bromeliad species native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-arranged leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
