    "intro": "Banksia nobilis subsp. nobilis, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flower spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals and fire. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in heathland and coastal environments. Due to habitat loss, it is listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act."
