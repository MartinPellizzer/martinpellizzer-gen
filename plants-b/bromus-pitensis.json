    "intro": "Bromus pitensis, commonly known as Pitman's brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage. Bromus pitensis is adapted to arid conditions and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss."
