    "intro": "Boehmeria ramiflora var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horse-hair grass, is a perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, pointed leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikelets that are often hidden among the foliage. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
