    "intro": "Briza microclada, commonly known as the slender feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features delicate, slender spikes of pale blue-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fine, hair-like leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils. Briza microclada is also known for its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
