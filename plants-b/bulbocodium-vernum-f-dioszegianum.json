    "intro": "Bulbocodium vernum f. dioszegianum, commonly known as the spring bulbocodium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its bulbs are small and fleshy, adapted for storing nutrients during dormancy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
