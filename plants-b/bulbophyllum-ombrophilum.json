It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within rainforests. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the wet season. The leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
