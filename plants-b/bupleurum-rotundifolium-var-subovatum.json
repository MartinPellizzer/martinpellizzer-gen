    "intro": "Bupleurum rotundifolium var. subovatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed valerian, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported tonic and antispasmodic properties. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Bupleurum rotundifolium."
