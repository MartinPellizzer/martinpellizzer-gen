It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically elliptical and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its hardy nature and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to horticultural collections."
