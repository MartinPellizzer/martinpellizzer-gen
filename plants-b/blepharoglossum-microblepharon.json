    "intro": "Blepharoglossum microblepharon, commonly known as the small-eyed moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, densely packed leaves. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly curled margin that distinguishes it from other liverworts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or in rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature."
