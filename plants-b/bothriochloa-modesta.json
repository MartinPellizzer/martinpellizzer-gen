    "intro": "Bothriochloa modesta, commonly known as slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often clustered at the base of the plant. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats or colonies. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can tolerate both drought and moderate flooding conditions."
