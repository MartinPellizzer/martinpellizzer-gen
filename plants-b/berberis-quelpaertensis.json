    "intro": "Berberis quelpaertensis, commonly known as the Jeju barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Korean Peninsula. It features prickly, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
