    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cordilabrum, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and botanical gardens."
