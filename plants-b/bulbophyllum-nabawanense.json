    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nabawanense, commonly known as the Nabawan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the rainforest canopy. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
