    "intro": "Bufonia duvaljouvei subsp. gottelandii, commonly known as the Gotteland bufonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern France. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features include heart-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
