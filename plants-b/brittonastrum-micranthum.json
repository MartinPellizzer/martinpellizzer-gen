    "intro": "Brittonastrum micranthum, commonly known as the narrowleaf brittonastrum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptation. Brittonastrum micranthum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
