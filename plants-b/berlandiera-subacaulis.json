    "intro": "Berlandiera subacaulis, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with hairy, branched stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Berlandiera subacaulis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
