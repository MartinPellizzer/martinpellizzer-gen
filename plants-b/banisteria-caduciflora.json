It is characterized by its rapid growth and distinctive, tubular, red-orange flowers that resemble trumpets. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that turn yellow when mature, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Banisteria caduciflora is valued in horticulture for its vibrant floral display and is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
