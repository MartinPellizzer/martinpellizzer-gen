    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ituriense, commonly known as the Ituri orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Central Africa. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. It typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its aerial roots for moisture and nutrients. The plant produces small, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and support its growth in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for horticultural collections and botanical gardens."
