    "intro": "Bromelia pyramidata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central reservoir to collect water. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating and pointed tips, which help in reducing water loss. The plant produces a flower spike that can reach several feet in height, bearing colorful bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
