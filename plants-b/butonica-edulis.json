    "intro": "Butonica edulis, commonly known as the golden leaf vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that turn a vibrant yellow when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, citrus-like berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm climates."
