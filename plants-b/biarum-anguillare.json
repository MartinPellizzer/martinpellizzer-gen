    "intro": "Biarum anguillare, commonly known as the snake's head orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, snake-like appearance, with a single, elongated flower that curves downward. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams and in forest understories. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, and it produces a single, showy bloom that is often pink or purple in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Biarum anguillare is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
