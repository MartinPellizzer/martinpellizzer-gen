    "intro": "Bilabrella cribbiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bilabrella, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and grassland habitats. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and small white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
