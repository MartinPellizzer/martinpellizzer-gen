It features small, heart-shaped leaves with striking variegation of white, yellow, and green, making it visually appealing. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets and as a decorative plant in indoor spaces."
