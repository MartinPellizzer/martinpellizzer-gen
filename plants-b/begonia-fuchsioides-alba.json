    "intro": "Begonia fuchsioides alba, commonly known as the white-flowered begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden beds. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
