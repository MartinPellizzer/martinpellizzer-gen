    "intro": "Batatas xanthorhiza, commonly known as yellow batata, is a tuberous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its starchy, yellow-orange tubers that are rich in carbohydrates. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. Its tubers are often used in cooking, similar to sweet potatoes, and are valued for their nutritional content. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
