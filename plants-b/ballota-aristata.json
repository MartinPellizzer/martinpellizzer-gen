    "intro": "Ballota aristata, commonly known as the purple rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ballota aristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
