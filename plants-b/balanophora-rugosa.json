    "intro": "Balanophora rugosa, commonly known as the rough balanophore, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of trees or shrubs. The plant has a highly reduced structure, with a thick, fleshy stem and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters at the base of the plant. Balanophora rugosa is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments."
