    "intro": "Betula tauschii var. pluricostata, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
