    "intro": "Berniera, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. They are characterized by their succulent, often spiny stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The flowers are typically small, clustered, and come in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Berniera species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
