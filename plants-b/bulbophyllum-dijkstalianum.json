    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dijkstalianum, commonly known as the Dijkstal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less favorable conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple."
