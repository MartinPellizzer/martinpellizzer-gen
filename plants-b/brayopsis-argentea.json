It is characterized by its large, fronds that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and colonize new areas. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex structure that enhances its ornamental value."
