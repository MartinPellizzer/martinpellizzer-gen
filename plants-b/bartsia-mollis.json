    "intro": "Bartsia mollis, commonly known as the soft bartsia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or white flowers in late spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its flowers are characterized by their two-lipped structure, typical of the Orobanchaceae family, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Bartsia mollis is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
