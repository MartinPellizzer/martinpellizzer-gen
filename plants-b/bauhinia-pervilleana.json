It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and divided into small, ovate leaflets. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in various soil types, including poor and rocky soils. Bauhinia pervilleana is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
