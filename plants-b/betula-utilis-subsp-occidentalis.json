    "intro": "Betula utilis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish or reddish inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests and rocky slopes."
