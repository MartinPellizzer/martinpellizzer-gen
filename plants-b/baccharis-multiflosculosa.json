    "intro": "Baccharis multiflosculosa, commonly known as the silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
