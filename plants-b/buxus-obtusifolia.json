    "intro": "Buxus obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with oval, leathery leaves that are broader and more rounded compared to other boxwood species. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for hedges, topiaries, and ornamental landscaping. Buxus obtusifolia is valued for its durability and ability to maintain shape with regular pruning."
