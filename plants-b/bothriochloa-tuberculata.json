    "intro": "Bothriochloa tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Bothriochloa tuberculata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
