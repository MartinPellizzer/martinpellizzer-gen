    "intro": "Baphia obanensis, commonly known as the Obanese baphia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
