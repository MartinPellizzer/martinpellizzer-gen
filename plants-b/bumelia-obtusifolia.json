It is characterized by its rough, ovate leaves with a waxy coating and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically eaten by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets.
