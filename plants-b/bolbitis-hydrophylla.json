    "intro": "Bolbitis hydrophylla, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically submerged, with some leaves extending above the water surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate and help in nutrient absorption. Bolbitis hydrophylla plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
