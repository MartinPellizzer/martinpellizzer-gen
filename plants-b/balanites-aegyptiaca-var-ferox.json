    "intro": "Balanites aegyptiaca var. ferox, commonly known as the wild date tree or ironwood tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces hard, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is encased in a thick, fleshy pulp. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and as a source of food and fuel."
