    "intro": "Batrachium paucistamineum f. aspergillifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaf batrachium, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive, aspergillifolium foliage. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside, contributing to its unique appearance. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are compound, with a prominent midrib and serrated margins. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
