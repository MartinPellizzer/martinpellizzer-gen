    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
