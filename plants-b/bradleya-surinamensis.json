    "intro": "Bradleya surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that resembles a flower but is actually a cluster of small blooms. The plant features a rosette of elongated, narrow leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. Bradleya surinamensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in botanical studies and horticulture."
