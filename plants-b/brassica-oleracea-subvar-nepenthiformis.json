    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. nepenthiformis, commonly known as the cabbage broccoli, is a rare and unique variant of the cabbage family. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, cabbage-like heads that resemble the structure of a broccoli. The plant produces small, green, cabbage-like leaves that are tightly packed together. It is primarily cultivated for its edible stems and leaves, which have a mild, slightly bitter flavor. This subvariety is relatively uncommon in agricultural settings due to its specific growing requirements and limited commercial cultivation."
