    "intro": "Berlinia lundensis, commonly known as the African sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves. The tree produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, pod-like fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. Berlinia lundensis is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
