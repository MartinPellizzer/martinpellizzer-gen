    "intro": "Begonia jureiensis, commonly known as the Jurei begonia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that display a range of colors from deep green to maroon. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
