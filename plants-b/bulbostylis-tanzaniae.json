    "intro": "Bulbostylis tanzaniae, commonly known as Tanzanian bulbostylis, is a species of grass belonging to the family Poaceae. It is native to Tanzania and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native region."
