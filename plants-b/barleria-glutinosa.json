    "intro": "Barleria glutinosa, commonly known as sticky barleria, is a flowering plant native to Africa, southern Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its erect, branching stems and hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a sticky, glandular coating. Barleria glutinosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blooms and resilience."
