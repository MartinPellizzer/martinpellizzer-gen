    "intro": "Buxus saligna, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a dense, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but not for humans. Buxus saligna is prized in horticulture for its compact growth and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
