    "intro": "Berlinia auriculata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve moisture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, wooded areas. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
