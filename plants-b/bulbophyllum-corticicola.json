    "intro": "Bulbophyllum corticicola, commonly known as the bark-attached orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, where it attaches itself to tree bark, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its challenging habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
