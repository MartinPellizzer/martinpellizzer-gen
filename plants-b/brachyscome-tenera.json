It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its silver-white, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
