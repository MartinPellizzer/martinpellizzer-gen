    "intro": "Baziasa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf baziasa, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained, rocky soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact size makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
