    "intro": "Brachystele guayanensis, commonly known as the Guayana dwarf moss, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of moss-like structures. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Guayana Highlands. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
