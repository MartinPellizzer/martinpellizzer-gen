    "intro": "Bromelia gurkeniana var. gurkeniana, commonly known as the Guatemalan bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central America. It features vibrant, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a water-holding cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with striking red and yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
