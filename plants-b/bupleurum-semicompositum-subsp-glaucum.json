It features slender, upright stems covered in a distinctive bluish-gray waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, typically arranged in loose clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, with a pale underside. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
