    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris subsp. taurica, commonly known as the Crimean rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal regions. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately divided, with small, bright yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
