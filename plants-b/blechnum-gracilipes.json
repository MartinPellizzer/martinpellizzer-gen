    "intro": "Blechnum gracilipes, commonly known as the slender holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with silver. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the ground. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
