    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bacilliferum, commonly known as the \"Bacillus-bearing Orchid,\" is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces numerous small, cylindrical pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
