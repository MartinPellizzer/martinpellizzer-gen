    "intro": "Braya cachensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a small flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Braya cachensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including cold temperatures and poor soil, and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
