    "intro": "Blepharocalyx ramosissimus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf satinash, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers clustered in panicles, which bloom in summer. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it suitable for container gardening or as a landscape specimen. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-drained, acidic soil."
