    "intro": "Betula alnoides var. cylindrostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a variant of the alnoid birch native to parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and smooth, pale bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are narrowly elliptic, with a pointed tip and a smooth margin, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, clustered catkins in the spring, which are typically male, while female flowers are found on the same tree. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
