    "intro": "Bromus lanceolatus subsp. macrostachys, commonly known as the giant speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with elongated, awned spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its growth habit and ecological role, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
