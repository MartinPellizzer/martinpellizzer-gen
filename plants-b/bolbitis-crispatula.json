    "intro": "Bolbitis crispatula, commonly known as the curly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Bolbitis crispatula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
