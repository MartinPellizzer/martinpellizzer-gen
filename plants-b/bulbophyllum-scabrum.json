    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scabrum, commonly known as the rough-leaved orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, giving it its common name. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of white or yellow, and bloom during the rainy season."
