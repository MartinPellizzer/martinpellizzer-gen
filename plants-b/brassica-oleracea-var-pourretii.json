    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. pourretii, commonly known as the Romanesco broccoli, is a cultivar of the cabbage species characterized by its distinctive fractal-like, spiraled inflorescences. This plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. Its tightly packed, cone-shaped flower heads are a result of genetic mutations that affect stem elongation and branching patterns. The leaves are typically dark green and slightly hairy, while the edible parts consist of the flower buds and young leaves. It is valued for its unique appearance and nutritional content, including high levels of vitamins and antioxidants."
