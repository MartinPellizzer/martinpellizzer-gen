It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits are usually berries that contain several seeds, and the plants often have a woody structure with aromatic bark.
