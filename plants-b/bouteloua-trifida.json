    "intro": "Bouteloua trifida, commonly known as three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often produce three awns on each spikelet. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, prairies, and fields, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and often have a bluish-green hue, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Bouteloua trifida is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
