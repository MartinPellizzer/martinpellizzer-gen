    "intro": "Brachypodium festucoides, commonly known as little barley, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators. Additionally, it is used in agricultural research due to its genetic similarity to wheat and barley."
