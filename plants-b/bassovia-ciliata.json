    "intro": "Bassovia ciliata, commonly known as the silky bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-haired leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a distinctive ciliate (frayed) edge on the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Bassovia ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance in garden settings."
