    "intro": "Banksia marginata, commonly known as the coast banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in cylindrical spikes, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its woody cones persist on the plant for many years. Banksia marginata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native wildlife, including honeyeaters and bees."
