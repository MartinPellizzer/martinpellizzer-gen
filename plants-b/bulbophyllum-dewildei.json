    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dewildei, commonly known as the Dewilde's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its fleshy, bulb-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
