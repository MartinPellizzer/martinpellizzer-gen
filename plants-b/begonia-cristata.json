    "intro": "Begonia cristata, commonly known as the crested begonia, is a striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, wavy, and often crinkled leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia cristata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
