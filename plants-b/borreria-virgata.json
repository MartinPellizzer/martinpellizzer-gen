    "intro": "Borreria virgata, commonly known as red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Borreria virgata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
