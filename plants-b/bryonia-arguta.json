    "intro": "Bryonia arguta, commonly known as the prickly gooseberry, is a toxic plant belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are highly poisonous due to the presence of toxic alkaloids. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often invasive species in its native range."
