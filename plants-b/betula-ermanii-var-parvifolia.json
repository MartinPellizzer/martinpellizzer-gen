It is characterized by its slender, elegant trunk and white, peeling bark that reveals a salmon-colored inner layer. The tree produces small, yellow-green catkins in early spring, followed by small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
