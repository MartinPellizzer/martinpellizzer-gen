    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. odorata, commonly known as the fragrant birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive aromatic properties. This plant is native to the northern regions of North America and is known for its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are typically triangular with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal forests and wetlands. The fragrant scent is released when the bark is rubbed, making it a unique feature of this botanical variant."
