    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. herbacea, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems and alternate, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by round, green siliques containing numerous seeds. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variety is considered a wild relative of cultivated cabbage and has been used in plant breeding programs to improve crop resilience."
