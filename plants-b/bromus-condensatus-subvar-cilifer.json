It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in areas with well-drained soils. This subvariety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
