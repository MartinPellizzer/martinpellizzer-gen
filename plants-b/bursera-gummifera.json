    "intro": "Bursera gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or copal tree, is a member of the Burseraceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody capsules that release sticky, aromatic resin. This resin, known as copal, has been used historically for incense and as a natural adhesive."
