It is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light and rich, humus-filled soil. Bletia \u00d7 similis produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and yellow, often with a distinctive yellow throat. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture due to its beauty and adaptability."
