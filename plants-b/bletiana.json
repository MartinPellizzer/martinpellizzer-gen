    "intro": "Bletiana, commonly known as the common bletilla, is a genus of orchids native to Asia. It consists of several species, including Bletilla striata, which is widely cultivated for its ornamental value. The plants are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically long and strap-like, and the flowers are often in shades of pink, white, or purple. Bletiana is appreciated in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
