    "intro": "Baloghia bureavii, commonly known as the Malagasy ironwood, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Baloghia bureavii is considered vulnerable and is of conservation concern."
