It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in open woodlands and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, club-shaped seed pods. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in some regions."
