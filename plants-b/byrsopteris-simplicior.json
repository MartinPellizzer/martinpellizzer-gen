    "intro": "Byrsopteris simplicior, commonly known as the simple maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated margin. Native to the southeastern United States, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important species in the study of fern biology and conservation."
