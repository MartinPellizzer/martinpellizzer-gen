    "intro": "Bignonia argyreoviolascens, commonly known as the silver viola or silverleaf bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and restoration projects."
