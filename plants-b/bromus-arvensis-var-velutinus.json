It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters along the stem. Velvet brome thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and agricultural fields. It is an important forage plant for livestock due to its nutritious foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
