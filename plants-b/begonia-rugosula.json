    "intro": "Begonia rugosula, commonly known as the rough-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features upright stems and heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, showy flowers."
