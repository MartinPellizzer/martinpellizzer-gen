    "intro": "Baccharis quinquenervis, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Baccharis quinquenervis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
