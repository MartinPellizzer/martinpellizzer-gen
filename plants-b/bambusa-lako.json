It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms, which contrast beautifully with its dark green leaves. The plant forms dense clumps and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Bambusa lako is also valued for its strong, flexible stalks, which can be used in basket weaving and construction."
