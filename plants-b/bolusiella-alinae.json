    "intro": "Bolusiella alinae, commonly known as the Alina's bolusiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolusiella alinae is considered a vulnerable species."
