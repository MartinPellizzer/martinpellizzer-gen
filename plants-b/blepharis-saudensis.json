    "intro": "Blepharis saudensis, commonly known as the Saudi blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes at the tips of the branches. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
