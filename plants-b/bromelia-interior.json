    "intro": "Bromelia interior, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically green to blue-green in color, with some varieties displaying intricate patterns. It produces a tall flower spike with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
