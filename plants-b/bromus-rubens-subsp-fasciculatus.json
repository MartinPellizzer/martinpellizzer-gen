It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces dense clusters of small, reddish-brown spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often found in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
