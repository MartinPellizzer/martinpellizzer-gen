It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, also known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, which bloom in clusters.

Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid regions."
