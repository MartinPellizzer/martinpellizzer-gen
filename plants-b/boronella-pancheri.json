    "intro": "Boronella pancheri, commonly known as the Pancheri boronella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Europe. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its small, five-petaled flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Boronella pancheri is considered a species of conservation concern."
