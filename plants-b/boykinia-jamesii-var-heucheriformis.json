    "intro": "Boykinia jamesii var. heucheriformis, commonly known as the silver moss cushion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white to pale green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in shades of pink or white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky stream banks. Its unique appearance and ability to form dense, cushion-like growths make it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
