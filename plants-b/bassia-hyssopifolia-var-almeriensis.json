    "intro": "Bassia hyssopifolia var. almeriensis, commonly known as Almer\u00eda fescue, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, preferring arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
