    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tigridum, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a tiger's stripes, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and can vary in color from yellow to orange and red. Bulbophyllum tigridum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
