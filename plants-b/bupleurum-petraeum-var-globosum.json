    "intro": "Bupleurum petraeum var. globosum, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. Bupleurum petraeum var. globosum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments."
