    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. concinna, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silvery inner layer, giving it its common name. The plant has small, triangular leaves that are usually doubly serrated and turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively cold-hardy, making it a common tree in boreal and temperate forests."
