    "intro": "Blechnum stierii, commonly known as the Stier's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to rocky or forested substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a lush, green appearance throughout much of the year."
