    "intro": "Begonia rufa, commonly known as the scarlet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. It is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden areas due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight. Begonia rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
