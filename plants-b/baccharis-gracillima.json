    "intro": "Baccharis gracillima, commonly known as silky baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, grayish-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Baccharis gracillima is adapted to drought conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid regions."
