    "intro": "Buxus hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the island of Hainan in southern China. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Buxus hainanensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to be shaped into formal topiaries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden settings."
