    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. depressa, commonly known as the curly kale or Italian kale, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, curled leaves that form a compact rosette, often with a dark green to purple coloration. The plant thrives in cool climates and is typically cultivated for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients such as vitamins A, C, and K. It produces small, yellow flowers that eventually develop into round, smooth pods containing seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassica genus, including cabbage and broccoli."
