    "intro": "Bumelia lanuginosa var. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, woolly leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
