    "intro": "Balanites, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Capparaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The plant is characterized by its spiny, woody shrubs or small trees, with small, yellowish flowers and fruit capsules that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Balanites species are adapted to survive in harsh environments, making them important components of desert ecosystems."
