    "intro": "Botrychium matricariifolium, commonly known as the common mouse-ear fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique adaptation helps the plant reproduce more effectively in low-light conditions."
