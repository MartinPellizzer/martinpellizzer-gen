    "intro": "Bryobium leavittii, commonly known as the Leavitt's moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, dense clusters of leafy shoots and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology with closely arranged, ovate leaves that often have a single costa. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
