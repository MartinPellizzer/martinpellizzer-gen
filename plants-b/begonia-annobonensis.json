    "intro": "Begonia annobonensis, commonly known as the Annobon Islands begonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Annobon in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers, which can be red, pink, or white, are borne on long pedicels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Begonia annobonensis is considered a critically endangered species."
