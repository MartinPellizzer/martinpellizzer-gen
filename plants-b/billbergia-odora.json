    "intro": "Billbergia odora, commonly known as the sweet-scented billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Billbergia odora is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
