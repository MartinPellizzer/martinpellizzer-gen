    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple cock's-foot, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is usually purple or reddish in color, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it is often found in disturbed soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
