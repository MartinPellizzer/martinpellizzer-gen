    "intro": "Betula alba lusus pendula, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a decorative variant of the white birch. It is characterized by its cascading branches that drape downwards, creating a unique, ornamental appearance. The tree has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, a feature common to many birch species. Its leaves are oval, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn, adding seasonal interest. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
