    "intro": "Brickellia kellermanii, commonly known as Kellerman's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with glandular hairs, which are characteristic of the Brickellia genus. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, sticky hairs, aiding in water retention. Brickellia kellermanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
