    "intro": "Burragea, commonly known as the burr bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is native to Australia and features shrubs or small trees with rough, often prickly bark. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture. The flowers are small, white or yellow, and are borne in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Burragea is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture."
