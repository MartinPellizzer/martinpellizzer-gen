It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are pinnately divided into small, triangular lobes. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in wetland restoration projects."
