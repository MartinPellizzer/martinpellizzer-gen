    "intro": "Bupleurum maddenii, commonly known as the Madeline's bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
