    "intro": "Braya pilosa subsp. thorild-wulffii, commonly known as the woolly braya, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is part of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar structural and ecological traits."
