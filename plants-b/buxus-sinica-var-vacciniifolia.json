It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage with striking white or yellow variegation patterns on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its slow growth rate and hardiness make it suitable for various garden environments."
