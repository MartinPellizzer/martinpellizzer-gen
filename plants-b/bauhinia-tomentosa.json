    "intro": "Bauhinia tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tree or flame of the forest, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, papery, fern-like leaves that turn bright red or orange in the fall. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a faintly hairy texture, and it often has a twisted, gnarled appearance. Bauhinia tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
