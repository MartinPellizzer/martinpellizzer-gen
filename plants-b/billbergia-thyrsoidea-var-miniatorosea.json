    "intro": "Billbergia thyrsoidea var. miniatorosea, commonly known as the miniature rose-bottle palm, is a compact bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom sequentially along a central stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
