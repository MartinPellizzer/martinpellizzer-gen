    "intro": "Blennodia cardaminoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed watercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It features alternate, doubly serrated leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinct basal rosette formation. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant relies on water for its growth, often thriving in shallow, flowing water. Blennodia cardaminoides is valued for its peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
