    "intro": "Bidens deltoidea, commonly known as the arrowleaf groundcherry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often covered in a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Bidens deltoidea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
