    "intro": "Buceras bellirica, commonly known as the Indian birch or Indian alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in panicles, followed by small, spherical fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical with a serrated margin. Buceras bellirica is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins."
