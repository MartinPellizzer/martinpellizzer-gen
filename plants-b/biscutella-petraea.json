It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and its spikes of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Biscutella petraea is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its medicinal and ornamental value. It is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
