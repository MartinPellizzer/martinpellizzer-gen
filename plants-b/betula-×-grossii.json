    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 grossii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a cross between the paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and the white birch (Betula pendula). It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of lighter-colored tissue. The plant has slender, pendulous branches and produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula \u00d7 grossii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
