    "intro": "Bothriocline nyungwensis, commonly known as the Nyungwe bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the montane forests of Rwanda. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments at high altitudes, often in association with other endemic flora. Its leaves are ovate and hairy, while its stems are upright and often branched. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within the Eastern Arc Mountains."
