The flowers are typically yellow with five petals and are followed by large, inflated, green fruits that mature to a yellow or orange hue. The fruit's exterior is covered in a rough, prickly texture, which gives the plant its common name. This plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which are used in various culinary traditions across Asia."
