    "intro": "Blepharis evansii, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers have five petals and are adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds efficiently."
