    "intro": "Bulbophyllum odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow with red or purple markings, making it visually striking."
