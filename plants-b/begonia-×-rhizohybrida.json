    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 rhizohybrida, commonly known as the hybrid begonia, is a popular ornamental plant valued for its vibrant, showy flowers. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia pavonina, combining the best traits of both parents. The plant typically produces clusters of tubular or funnel-shaped blooms in shades of red, pink, and white, often with contrasting markings. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for both garden beds and container planting. Its foliage is usually heart-shaped and often displays attractive variegation, adding visual interest to the plant's overall appearance."
