    "intro": "Begonia stichochaete, commonly known as the zigzag begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, zigzag-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from both its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
