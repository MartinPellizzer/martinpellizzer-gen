    "intro": "Bombax macrocarpum, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, which bloom in the spring. The tree produces large, fluffy seed pods that contain cotton-like fibers, which are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its drought resistance. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
