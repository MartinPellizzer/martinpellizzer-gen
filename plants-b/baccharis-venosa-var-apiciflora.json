    "intro": "Baccharis venosa var. apiciflora, commonly known as the Florida baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control in wetlands and coastal areas. It thrives in moist to wet conditions and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks."
