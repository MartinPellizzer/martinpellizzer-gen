    "intro": "Brassia longicuspis, commonly known as the long-fringed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The orchid produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
