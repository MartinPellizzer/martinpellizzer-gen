    "intro": "Buiningia purpurea, commonly known as the purple beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds and persist into the winter. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Buiningia purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
