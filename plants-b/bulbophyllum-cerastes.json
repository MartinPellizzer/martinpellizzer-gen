    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cerastes, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique horn-like shape, which gives it its common name. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Bulbophyllum cerastes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
