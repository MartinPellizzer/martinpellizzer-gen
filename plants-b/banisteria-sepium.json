    "intro": "Banisteria sepium, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, dense clusters of bright red or orange flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when cut. Banisteria sepium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
