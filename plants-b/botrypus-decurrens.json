    "intro": "Botrypus decurrens, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that can form dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that help it float. Botrypus decurrens plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
