    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bigibbosum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of two prominent lobes on its pseudobulbs. The plant produces numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
