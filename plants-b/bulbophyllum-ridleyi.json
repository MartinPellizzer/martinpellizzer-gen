    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ridleyi, commonly known as the Ridley's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. The flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects."
