    "intro": "Brosimum gaudichaudii var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sycamore, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Its bark is thick and often fissured, providing a distinctive appearance. The leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its adaptability in humid environments."
