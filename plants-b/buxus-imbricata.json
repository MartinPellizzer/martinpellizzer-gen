    "intro": "Buxus imbricata, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, glossy, dark green foliage that transitions to a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a favored plant in both gardens and landscaping projects."
