    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rhodophyllum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, vibrant red flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in survival during dry periods. The flowers are often clustered and can bloom multiple times a year under suitable conditions."
