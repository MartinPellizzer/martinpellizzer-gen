    "intro": "Betula delavayi var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola birch, is a variant of the Delavay birch native to high-altitude regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
