    "intro": "Bulbophyllum maskeliyense, commonly known as the Maskeliyena orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients to help it survive in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered a threatened species."
