    "intro": "Bassia petiolaris, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering the ground in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in hot, dry climates. Bassia petiolaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
