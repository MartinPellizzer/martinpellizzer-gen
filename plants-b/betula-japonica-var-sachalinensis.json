    "intro": "Betula japonica var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are visible in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
