    "intro": "Bancalus maingayi, commonly known as the golden blister beetle, is a species of scarab beetle native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, glossy body and distinctive yellow or orange coloration, which serves as a warning signal to potential predators. The plant-associated life cycle of this beetle involves feeding on the foliage of various plants, particularly those in the legume family. Its larvae are often found in the soil, where they feed on plant roots, contributing to nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. The beetle's presence can sometimes be an indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
