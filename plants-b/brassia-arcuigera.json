    "intro": "Brassia arcuigera, commonly known as the bow-shaped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, curving flowers that resemble a bow, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a vibrant mix of yellow and orange, with a distinctive spurred shape. Brassia arcuigera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
