    "intro": "Begonia crenulata, commonly known as the scalloped begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia crenulata is often cultivated as a decorative plant for indoor or outdoor gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
