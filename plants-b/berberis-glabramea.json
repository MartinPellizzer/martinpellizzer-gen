    "intro": "Berberis glabramea, commonly known as the smooth barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features compound leaves with three to five elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. Its bark and leaves contain berberine, a compound with medicinal properties. Berberis glabramea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
