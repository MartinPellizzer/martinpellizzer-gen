    "intro": "Blutaparon repens, commonly known as the creeping bluet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
