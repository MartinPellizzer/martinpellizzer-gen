    "intro": "Berberis tenuispina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and persistent winter interest."
