    "intro": "Brodiaea lemmoniae, commonly known as the Lemmon's brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, rounded bulbs for storage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
