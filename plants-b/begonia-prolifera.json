    "intro": "Begonia prolifera, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that produce numerous small, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ability to spread via runners makes it an effective ground cover in humid climates."
