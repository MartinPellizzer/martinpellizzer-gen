It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem. Bellardia repens is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
