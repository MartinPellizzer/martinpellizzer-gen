It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to other cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. The plant typically grows as a biennial, though it is often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, with a slightly sour taste due to the presence of glucosinolates.
