    "intro": "Blechnum crispum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they have a secondary division of pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. Blechnum crispum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has cultural significance in M\u0101ori traditions."
