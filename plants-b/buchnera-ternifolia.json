    "intro": "Buchnera ternifolia, commonly known as the three-leafed dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls of three, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, depending on the species. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Buchnera ternifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
