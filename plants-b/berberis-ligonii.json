    "intro": "Berberis ligonii, commonly known as the prickly barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically green and oval in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical characteristics make it both a useful landscape plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
