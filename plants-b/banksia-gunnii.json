    "intro": "Banksia gunnii, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flower spikes, which bloom in late summer and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia gunnii thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens."
