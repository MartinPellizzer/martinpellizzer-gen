    "intro": "Bakerella, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with a central cluster of stamens. The leaves are typically palmately divided, and the plants are often found in moist, temperate environments. Bakerella species are known for their toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation. They play an important role in pollination and serve as a food source for certain insects and herbivores."
