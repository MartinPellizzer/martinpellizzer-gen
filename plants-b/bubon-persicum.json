    "intro": "Bubon persicum, commonly known as the Persian peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which appear before the leaves in early spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that ripens to a yellow or orange color, often with a sweet, aromatic flavor. Bubon persicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional horticulture."
