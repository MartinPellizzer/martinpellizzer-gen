    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. pectinatus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple, and its inflorescence is typically compact and cylindrical. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus patulus var. pectinatus is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
