    "intro": "Bromus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Bromus subalpinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine organisms."
