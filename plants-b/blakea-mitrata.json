    "intro": "Blakea mitrata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in countries like Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Blakea mitrata grows as an epiphytic shrub, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
