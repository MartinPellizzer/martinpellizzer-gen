It is a terrestrial herb with a short, rhizomatous stem and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, which are often tinged with purple or pink. Bletia angustata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
