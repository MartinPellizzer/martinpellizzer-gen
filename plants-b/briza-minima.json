    "intro": "Briza minima, commonly known as the common mouse-tail, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, arching stems that bear delicate, fluffy panicles of tiny flowers, which give it its characteristic appearance. The plant typically reaches a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Briza minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in gardens for its delicate, airy appearance."
