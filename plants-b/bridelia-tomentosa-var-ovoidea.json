    "intro": "Bridelia tomentosa var. ovoidea, commonly known as the woolly bridelia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical in shape, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some animal species. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
