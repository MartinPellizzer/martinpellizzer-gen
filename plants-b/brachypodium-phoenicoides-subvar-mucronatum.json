    "intro": "Brachypodium phoenicoides subvar. mucronatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush habitats. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
