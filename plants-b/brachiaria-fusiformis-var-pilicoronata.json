    "intro": "Brachiaria fusiformis var. pilicoronata, commonly known as the hairy fingergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in pastures and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other Brachiaria species. It is valued for its forage quality and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
