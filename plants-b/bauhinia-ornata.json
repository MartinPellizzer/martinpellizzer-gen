It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its bark is smooth and often fissured. Bauhinia ornata thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
