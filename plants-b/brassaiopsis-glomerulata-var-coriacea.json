    "intro": "Brassaiopsis glomerulata var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and rough-textured leaves, which give it its scientific variety name *coriacea*, meaning \"coriaceous\" or bark-like. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. This species is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and its ornamental appeal."
