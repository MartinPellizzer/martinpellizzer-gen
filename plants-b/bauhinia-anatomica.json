    "intro": "Bauhinia anatomica, commonly known as the skeleton leaf tree, is a small to medium-sized leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that resemble a skeletal structure, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Bauhinia anatomica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as savannas and woodlands. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and ornamental contexts."
