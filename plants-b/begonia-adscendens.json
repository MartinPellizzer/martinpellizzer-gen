    "intro": "Begonia adscendens, commonly known as the climbing begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems that can grow up to several meters in length, making it suitable for hanging baskets or vertical gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a distinctive spurred shape. Begonia adscendens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
