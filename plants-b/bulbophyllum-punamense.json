    "intro": "Bulbophyllum punamense, commonly known as the Punam orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks, typically in humid and shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration, often in shades of yellow and green. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
