    "intro": "Bonyunia superba, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a vibrant display during the warmer months. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, greyish-brown bark that becomes more fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Bonyunia superba is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a shade tree due to its broad canopy."
