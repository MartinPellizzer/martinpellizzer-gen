It is a biennial or annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces large, yellow, cruciform flowers that attract pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. The seeds are enclosed in a pod and are used for oil extraction, similar to other Brassica species."
