    "intro": "Buxus rugulosa var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. This variety thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for use as a topiary or in rock gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
