    "intro": "Braya humilis subsp. porsildii, commonly known as the Porridge-braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cross-shaped flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
