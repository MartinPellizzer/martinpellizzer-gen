    "intro": "Bumelia reclinata var. rufotomentosa, commonly known as the rough-hairy bumelia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, reddish-brown hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough, hairy texture. This species is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and woodland edges."
