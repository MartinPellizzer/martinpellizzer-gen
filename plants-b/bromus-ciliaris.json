    "intro": "Bromus ciliaris, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands, pastures, and disturbed areas. Bromus ciliaris is valued for its use in forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid establishment."
