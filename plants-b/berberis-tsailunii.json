The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
