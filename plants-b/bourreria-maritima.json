It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in beach environments. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bourreria maritima is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions."
