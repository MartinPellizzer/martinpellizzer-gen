    "intro": "Betula alba var. carelica, commonly known as the white birch, is a variant of the European white birch. It is characterized by its slender, zigzag branches and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and white, often peeling in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species is typically found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
