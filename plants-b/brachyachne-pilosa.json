    "intro": "Brachyachne pilosa, commonly known as hairy bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Brachyachne pilosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native environment."
