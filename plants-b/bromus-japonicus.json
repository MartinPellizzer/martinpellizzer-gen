    "intro": "Bromus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
