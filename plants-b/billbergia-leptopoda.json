    "intro": "Billbergia leptopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Billbergia leptopoda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
