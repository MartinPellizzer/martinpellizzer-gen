It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils along streambanks and in prairie habitats. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, racemose inflorescences. The fruit, a smooth-seeded capsule, is adapted for wind dispersal and can persist on the ground for several years."
