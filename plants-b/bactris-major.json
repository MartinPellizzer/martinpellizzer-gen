    "intro": "Bactris major, commonly known as the giant palm or the Brazilian wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its long, unbranched stems and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, followed by edible, fibrous fruits. Its trunk is often covered in a thick layer of fibrous material, which is used in traditional crafts. Bactris major is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
