    "intro": "Balanophora involucrata, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a rare parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which means it cannot perform photosynthesis and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, thick stem covered in a dense, velvety layer of hair, giving it its common name. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often attaching itself to the roots of other plants. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a unique and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
