It features elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. Its foliage is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
