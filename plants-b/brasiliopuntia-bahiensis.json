    "intro": "Brasiliopuntia bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, a typical adaptation to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. Brasiliopuntia bahiensis is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range."
