    "intro": "Bupleurum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, hairy stems that grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are round or ovate, with a distinctive waxy coating, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Bupleurum rotundifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties."
