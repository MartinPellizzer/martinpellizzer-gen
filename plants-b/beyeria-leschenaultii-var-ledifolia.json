    "intro": "Beyeria leschenaultii var. ledifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf beyeria, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
