    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its root system is notable for its deep, fibrous structure, which helps it thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as scrublands and rocky slopes."
