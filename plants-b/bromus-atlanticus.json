    "intro": "Bromus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic brome, is a species of grass native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Bromus atlanticus is adapted to salt-laden air and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal exposure."
