    "intro": "Baccharis attenuata, commonly known as sand verbena, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Baccharis attenuata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
