It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of tropical rainforests. Its foliage is often a deep green with intricate patterns, while its flowers come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
