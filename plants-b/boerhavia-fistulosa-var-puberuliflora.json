    "intro": "Boerhavia fistulosa var. puberuliflora, commonly known as the puberulous bladderleaf, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
