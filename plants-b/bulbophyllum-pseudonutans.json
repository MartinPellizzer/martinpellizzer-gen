    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pseudonutans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom during the dry season. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern. Due to its fragility and limited natural range, it is highly susceptible to habitat loss and illegal collection."
