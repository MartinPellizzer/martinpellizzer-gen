    "intro": "Berberis nigra, commonly known as blackberry lily, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features upright, spiny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Berberis nigra thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
