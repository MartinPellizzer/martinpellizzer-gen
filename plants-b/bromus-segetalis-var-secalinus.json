    "intro": "Bromus segetalis var. secalinus, commonly known as the wheatgrass or soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with small, awned lemmas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along field edges. This species is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop."
