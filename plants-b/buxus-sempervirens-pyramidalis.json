    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage that remains throughout the year, making it a popular choice for formal garden designs. The plant has a naturally pyramidal shape, which requires minimal pruning to maintain its structure. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, preferring a cool, sheltered environment. Due to its slow growth rate and durability, it is often used in topiary and hedging applications."
