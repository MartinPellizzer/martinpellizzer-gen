    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kuanwuense, commonly known as the Kuanwu orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
