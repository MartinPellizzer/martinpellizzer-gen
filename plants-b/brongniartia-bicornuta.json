    "intro": "Brongniartia bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bifurcated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. The fronds are leathery and have a unique, almost triangular shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
