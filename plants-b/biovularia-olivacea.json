It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with olive-green hues, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires support for its climbing habit. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
