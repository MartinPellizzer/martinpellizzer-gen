    "intro": "Blepharodon philibertioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf blepharodon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
