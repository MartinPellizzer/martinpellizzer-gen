    "intro": "Bakoa sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the island of Sicily. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Bakoa sicula is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
