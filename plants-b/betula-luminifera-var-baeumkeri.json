    "intro": "Betula luminifera var. baeumkeri, commonly known as the Moonlight Birch, is a rare and striking variant of the luminifera birch species. It is characterized by its exceptionally white, almost glowing bark that reflects light, giving it a spectral appearance. The tree has slender, upright branches and produces small, inconspicuous catkins in the spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped, with a smooth margin and a slightly serrated edge. This variant is highly valued in botanical gardens for its unique visual appeal and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
