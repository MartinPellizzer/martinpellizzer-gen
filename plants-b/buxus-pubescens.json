    "intro": "Buxus pubescens, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are covered with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ability to be shaped into topiaries and its tolerance to pruning. Buxus pubescens prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden borders and foundation plantings."
