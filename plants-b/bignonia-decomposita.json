    "intro": "Bignonia decomposita, commonly known as the yellow woodbine, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Bignonia decomposita is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it can climb trees or shrubs."
