    "intro": "Bolbitis koidzumii, commonly known as the Koidzumi's shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Bolbitis koidzumii is considered a species of conservation concern."
