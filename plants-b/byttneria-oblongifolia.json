    "intro": "Byttneria oblongifolia, commonly known as the African blackwood, is a tropical tree native to regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and broad, ovate leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is both ecologically significant and valued for its timber."
