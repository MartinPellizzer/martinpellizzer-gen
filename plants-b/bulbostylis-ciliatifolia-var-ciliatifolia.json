    "intro": "Bulbostylis ciliatifolia var. ciliatifolia, commonly known as the slender bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the base of the plant. This variant is distinguished by its finely ciliate (hairy) leaf margins, which contribute to its scientific name."
