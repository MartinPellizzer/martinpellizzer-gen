    "intro": "Bulbophyllum propinquum, commonly known as the close relative or near kin of the genus Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in conditions with irregular rainfall. Bulbophyllum propinquum is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
