    "intro": "Bromus vitiosus, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each containing two to three florets. Bromus vitiosus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
