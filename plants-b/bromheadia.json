    "intro": "Bromheadia, commonly known as the bromheadia plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The flowers, which are usually red or orange, are borne on tall, leafless stems and are often showy. Bromheadia species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. These plants are popular in horticulture for their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
