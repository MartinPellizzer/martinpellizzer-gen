It is characterized by its large, showy blue-violet flowers that appear in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. The tree produces large, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for Indigenous Australians. Its leaves are long, narrow, and glossy, contributing to its ornamental value. Bunnya cyanocalyx plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
