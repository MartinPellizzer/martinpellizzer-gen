It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often described as resembling those of the maidenhair fern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands.
