    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed areas or along trails. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and restoration projects."
