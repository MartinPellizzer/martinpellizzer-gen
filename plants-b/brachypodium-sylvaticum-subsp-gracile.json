    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender wood rush, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
