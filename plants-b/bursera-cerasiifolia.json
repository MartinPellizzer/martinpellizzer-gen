    "intro": "Bursera cerasiifolia, commonly known as the Mexican mahogany or white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale-gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bursera cerasiifolia is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally for furniture and construction."
