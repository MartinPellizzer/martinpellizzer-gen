    "intro": "Benstonea alticola, commonly known as the highland benstonea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Benstoneaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Benstonea alticola is considered a conservation concern."
