It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
