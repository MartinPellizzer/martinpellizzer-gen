    "intro": "Bradea, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that float on the surface of still water. Bradea species typically have heart-shaped leaves that are submerged or floating, with the flowers emerging above the water. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant plays an important role in traditional medicine and cultural practices in many Asian countries."
