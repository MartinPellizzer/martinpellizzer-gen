    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum, commonly known as the multifid fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, feather-like fronds that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium multifidum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ephemeral life cycle, with most of its growth occurring in a single season."
