    "intro": "Billbergia wetherellii, commonly known as the Wetherell's billbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia wetherellii is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
