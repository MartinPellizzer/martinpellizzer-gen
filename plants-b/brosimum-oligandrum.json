    "intro": "Brosimum oligandrum, commonly known as the Cuban mulberry, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, inedible berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils."
