    "intro": "Bauhinia glabrifolia subsp. sericea, commonly known as the silky bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
