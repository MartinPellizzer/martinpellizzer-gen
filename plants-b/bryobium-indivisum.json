    "intro": "Bryobium indivisum, commonly known as the slender liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a thalloid structure with a smooth, green upper surface and a darker, often reddish underside. Its reproductive structures, called sporophytes, are simple and consist of a capsule that releases spores. Bryobium indivisum is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a common species in dry, rocky habitats."
