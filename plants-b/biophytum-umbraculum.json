    "intro": "Biophytum umbraculum, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique rosette-shaped foliage, which consists of fleshy, dark green leaves that can turn reddish under intense sunlight. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
