    "intro": "Bromheadia petuangensis, commonly known as the Philippine pineapple plant, is a rare member of the Bromeliaceae family native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
