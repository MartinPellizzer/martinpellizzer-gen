It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, glabrous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
