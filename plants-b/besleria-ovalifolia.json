    "intro": "Besleria ovalifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed begonia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purplish tinge on the underside. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
