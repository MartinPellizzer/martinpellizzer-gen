    "intro": "Baccharis rupestris, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of its native ecosystem."
