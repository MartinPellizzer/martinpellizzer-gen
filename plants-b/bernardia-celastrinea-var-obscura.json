    "intro": "Bernardia celastrinea var. obscura, commonly known as the dark-leaved bernardia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
