    "intro": "Boehmeria cylindrica var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal Boehmeria, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of East Asia. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly waxy surface to reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
