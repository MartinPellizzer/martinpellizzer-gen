    "intro": "Bruguiera sexangula var. rhynchopetala, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a variant of the red mangrove species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive prop roots that provide structural support and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a crucial role in coastal ecosystem stabilization. Its small, pinkish flowers are adapted for pollination by wind and insects, while its fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. This variant exhibits morphological adaptations that enable it to survive in tidal zones and contribute to mangrove forest regeneration."
