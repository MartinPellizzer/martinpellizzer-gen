    "intro": "Bonatea boltonii, commonly known as the Bolton's bonatea, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its floral structure consists of both ray and disk flowers, with the latter being tubular and often colored in shades of yellow or orange. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bonatea boltonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
