It is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and red. These plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures without being parasitic. Beccarianthus species are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin. They require high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
