    "intro": "Buddleja grandiflora var. foliosa, commonly known as the broadleaf buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It features striking, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical Buddleja species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
