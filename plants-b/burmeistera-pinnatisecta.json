It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has finely dissected, pinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
