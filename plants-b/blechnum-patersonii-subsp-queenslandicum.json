    "intro": "Blechnum patersonii subsp. queenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland harts-tongue fern, is a fern species native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, tongue-like shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are robust and help it form dense colonies, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
