    "intro": "Bolbitis scandens, commonly known as the climbing water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Bolbitis scandens is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and water filtration."
