    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mesodon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that supports its aerial roots and pseudobulbs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow-green flowers during the wet season. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Bulbophyllum mesodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
