    "intro": "Blechnum meridionale, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive blackish coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is less pronounced in B. meridionale."
