    "intro": "Bulbostylis asperula, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wet or marshy habitats and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a stabilizing plant in aquatic environments."
