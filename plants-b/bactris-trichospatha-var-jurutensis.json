It is a tall, slender palm tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching material. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that is edible and has a sweet, nutty flavor. The plant is well adapted to wet, tropical environments and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
