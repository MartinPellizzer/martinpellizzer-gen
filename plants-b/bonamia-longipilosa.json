It features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Bonamia longipilosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
