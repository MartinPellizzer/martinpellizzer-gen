    "intro": "Bactris kamarupa, commonly known as the Kamarupa palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender palm with a single stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in inflorescences, followed by clustered fruits that are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are often used in traditional practices and for thatching, while the trunk is valued for its durable fibers. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
