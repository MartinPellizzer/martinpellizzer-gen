    "intro": "Baobab, commonly known as the \"tree of life,\" is a genus of about 15 species of large, deciduous trees native to Africa, Australia, and Madagascar. These trees are characterized by their massive, bottle-shaped trunks that store large amounts of water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. Their leaves are palmate, consisting of several broad, lobed leaflets, and they produce yellow, fig-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a large, spiny capsule containing a powdery pulp and edible seeds. Baobab trees also have a unique root system that helps prevent soil erosion and supports local ecosystems."
