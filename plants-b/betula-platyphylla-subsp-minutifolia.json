    "intro": "Betula platyphylla subsp. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin, papery layers. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, including tundra and boreal forests, and is often found in open, sunny areas."
