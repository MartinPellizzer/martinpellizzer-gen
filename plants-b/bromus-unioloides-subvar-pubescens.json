    "intro": "Bromus unioloides subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist meadows and riparian areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from other bromes. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each containing three to five flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
