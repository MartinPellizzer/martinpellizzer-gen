It is characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
