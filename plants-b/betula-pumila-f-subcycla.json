    "intro": "Betula pumila f. subcycla, commonly known as the dwarf birch or the zigzag birch, is a shrub-like form of the dwarf birch species. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing no taller than 1 meter, and its dense, compact growth habit. The leaves are small, elliptical, and often have a zigzag or wavy margin, giving it its common name. It is a deciduous plant, losing its leaves in the fall, and is adapted to cold, boreal climates. This subspecies is often found in moist, acidic soils in northern regions, including parts of North America and Eurasia."
