    "intro": "Bupleurum prostratum, commonly known as creeping bupleurum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Russian Far East. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Bupleurum prostratum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
