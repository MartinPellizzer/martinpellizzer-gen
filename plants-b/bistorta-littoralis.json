    "intro": "Bistorta littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bistorta, is a perennial herb native to the rocky shores of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, saline environments and is often found growing in coastal cliffs and tidal zones. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor firmly in unstable, coastal soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh maritime conditions. Bistorta littoralis produces small, pale pink or white flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
