    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. violacea, commonly known as purple cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its distinctive violet or purple flower heads. The plant is a biennial, typically grown as an annual, and thrives in cool climates. Its flowers are tightly packed, forming a dense head that resembles cauliflower but with a striking purple hue. The leaves are dark green and somewhat coarse, similar to other members of the Brassica genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also edible, with a mild, nutty flavor."
