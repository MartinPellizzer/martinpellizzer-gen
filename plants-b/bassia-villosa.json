    "intro": "Bassia villosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit help it conserve water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
