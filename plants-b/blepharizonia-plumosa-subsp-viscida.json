    "intro": "Blepharizonia plumosa subsp. viscida, commonly known as the sticky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of sticky, glandular hairs on its leaf blades. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
