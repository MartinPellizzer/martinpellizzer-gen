    "intro": "Betula saposhnikovii subsp. murgabica, commonly known as the Murgab birch, is a rare and endemic species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a pointed tip, typically turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers on separate trees. This species thrives in mountainous regions and is adapted to cold, dry climates."
