    "intro": "Begonia asperifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvety begonia, is a tropical plant characterized by its soft, hairy foliage. It features ovate to elliptical leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and vibrant floral display."
