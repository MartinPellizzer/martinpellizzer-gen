    "intro": "Billbergia manarae, commonly known as the Manarae billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features rosette-shaped leaves that are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Billbergia manarae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
