It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it well adapted to drought. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and succulent gardens."
