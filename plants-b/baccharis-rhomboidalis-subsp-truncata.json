    "intro": "Baccharis rhomboidalis subsp. truncata, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptic leaves that are often gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the late summer and early fall. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
