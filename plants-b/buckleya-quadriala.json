    "intro": "Buckleya quadriala, commonly known as the four-angled buckleya, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Buckleya quadriala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
