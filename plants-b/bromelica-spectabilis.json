    "intro": "Bromelica spectabilis, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiny, sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a flowering stem that bears a terminal inflorescence with colorful bracts, often mistaken for flowers. After flowering, it produces a fruit that is the familiar pineapple we consume. The plant is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, requiring high humidity and well-drained soil."
