    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longibulbum, commonly known as the long-bulb orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and linear, leathery leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
