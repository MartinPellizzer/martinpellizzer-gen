    "intro": "Bugula reptans, commonly known as the creeping whorl sponge, is a marine bryozoan that exhibits a unique colonial structure. Its body consists of numerous small, calcareous zooids arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. The colonies are typically attached to substrates such as rocks or artificial structures in shallow coastal waters. Bugula reptans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various small marine organisms. Its reproductive strategy involves both sexual and asexual reproduction, contributing to its widespread distribution."
