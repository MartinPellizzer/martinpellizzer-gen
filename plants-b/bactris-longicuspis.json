    "intro": "Bactris longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined palm, is a species of palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. Bactris longicuspis is adapted to grow in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid lowland areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and of interest for horticultural cultivation."
