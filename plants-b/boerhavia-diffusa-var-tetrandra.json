    "intro": "Boerhavia diffusa var. tetrandra, commonly known as spreading horsebean, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, sprawling stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a distinct, slightly aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, gardens, and along roadsides."
