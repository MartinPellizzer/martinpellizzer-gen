    "intro": "Begonia sangkulirangensis, commonly known as the Sangkulirang begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that exhibit a unique combination of colors, often featuring deep green with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
