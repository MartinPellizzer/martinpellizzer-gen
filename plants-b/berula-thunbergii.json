    "intro": "Berula thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in wet environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in moist soils and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland habitats."
