    "intro": "Bartsia litoralis, commonly known as sea bartsia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing herb with delicate, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Bartsia litoralis is often found in maritime habitats and is considered a characteristic species of coastal vegetation."
