    "intro": "Bulbophyllum dendrobioides, commonly known as the tree orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, and its long, arching stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
