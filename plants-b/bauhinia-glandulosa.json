    "intro": "Bauhinia glandulosa, commonly known as the velvetwood or glandular bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Bauhinia glandulosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in savannas and rocky soils. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
