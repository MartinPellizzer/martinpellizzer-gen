It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a yellowish inner layer, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring. The leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
