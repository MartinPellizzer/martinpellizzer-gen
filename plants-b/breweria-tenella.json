    "intro": "Breweria tenella, commonly known as the narrowleaf breweria, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in arid regions and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Breweria tenella is valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience in harsh environments."
