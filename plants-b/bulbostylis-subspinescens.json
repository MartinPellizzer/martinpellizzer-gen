    "intro": "Bulbostylis subspinescens, commonly known as the spiny bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and distinctive, spiny bracts that enclose its small, spikelet-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. This plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
