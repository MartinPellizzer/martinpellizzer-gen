    "intro": "Bauhinia anomala, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral clusters that appear in spring, giving the plant its common name. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, and are typically green with a smooth texture. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bauhinia anomala is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in tropical regions."
