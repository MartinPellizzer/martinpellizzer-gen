    "intro": "Baccharoides anthelmintica, commonly known as the antihelmintic shrub, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly its ability to expel parasitic worms, which has led to its traditional use in herbal medicine. Its adaptability to arid environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. However, further research is needed to fully explore its potential in modern pharmacology."
