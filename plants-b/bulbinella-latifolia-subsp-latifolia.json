    "intro": "Bulbinella latifolia subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bulbinella, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Australia. It features a short, fibrous rootstock and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
