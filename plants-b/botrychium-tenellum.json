    "intro": "Botrychium tenellum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a unique structure with a single, leaf-like frond that is divided into two parts, one of which is a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. Its reproductive structures are often covered in a protective layer called a indusium. Botrychium tenellum is characterized by its simple, non-branching frond and is often found in the understory of temperate forests."
