    "intro": "Bidens incumbens, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It features slender, branching stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with two white ray florets, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Bidens incumbens is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in many regions."
