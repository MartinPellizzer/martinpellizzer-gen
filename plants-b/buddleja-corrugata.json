    "intro": "Buddleja corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated bush willow, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, corrugated bark and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it produces small, round, woody fruits that contain seeds. Buddleja corrugata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
