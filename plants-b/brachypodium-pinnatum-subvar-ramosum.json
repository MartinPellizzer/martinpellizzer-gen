It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with lemmas that are hairy and sometimes awned. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
