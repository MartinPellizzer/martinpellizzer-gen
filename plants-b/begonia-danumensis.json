    "intro": "Begonia danumensis, commonly known as the Danum begonia, is a species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often along forest floors or in understory habitats. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a unique, spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Begonia danumensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
