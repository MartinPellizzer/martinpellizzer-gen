    "intro": "Beschorneria, commonly known as the \"Mexican yucca,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the asparagus family, Asparagaceae. It is native to Mexico and parts of Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves, which are typically sword-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle. Beschorneria species produce striking panicles of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring or early summer. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively low-maintenance once established."
