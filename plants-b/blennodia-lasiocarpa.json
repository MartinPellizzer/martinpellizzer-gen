It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed pod that contains several seeds. Blennodia lasiocarpa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
