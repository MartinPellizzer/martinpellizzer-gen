    "intro": "Bouteloua triaena, commonly known as gray grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Gray grama is often found in prairies, sandy soils, and disturbed areas, and it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its drought tolerance and resilience make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
