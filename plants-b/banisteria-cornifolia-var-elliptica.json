    "intro": "Banisteria cornifolia var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The leaves are elliptical in shape, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental beauty in gardens and as a landscape specimen."
