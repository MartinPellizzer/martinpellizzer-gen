    "intro": "Briggsia forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's bristle fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Briggsia forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern."
