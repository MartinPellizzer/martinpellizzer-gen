    "intro": "Boehmeria uliginosa, commonly known as marsh abutilon, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color, and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used in traditional medicine and for making textiles. Boehmeria uliginosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
