It is a small epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming during the rainy season. Its pseudobulbs are compact and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
