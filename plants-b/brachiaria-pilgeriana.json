It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Brachiaria pilgeriana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in disturbed environments."
