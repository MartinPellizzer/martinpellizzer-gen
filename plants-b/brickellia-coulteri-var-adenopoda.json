    "intro": "Brickellia coulteri var. adenopoda, commonly known as Texas brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in limestone habitats. It is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 feet, with a compact, bushy growth habit. The leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
