    "intro": "Bolbosaponaria sewerzowii, commonly known as the woolly saponaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of woolly, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Bolbosaponaria sewerzowii is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open grasslands and wastelands. Its saponin-containing sap can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
