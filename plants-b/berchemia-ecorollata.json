    "intro": "Berchemia ecorollata, commonly known as the white berchemia, is a deciduous shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a woody stem with a rough, bark-like texture. Berchemia ecorollata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
