    "intro": "Boronia hyssopifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boronia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Boronia hyssopifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
