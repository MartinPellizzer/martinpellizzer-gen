    "intro": "Berberis koreana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Korea. It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used ornately in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile addition to landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
