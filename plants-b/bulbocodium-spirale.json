    "intro": "Bulbocodium spirale, commonly known as the spiral bulbous plant, is a flowering plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous stem and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and its ability to store water in its bulb make it well adapted to arid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in Mediterranean climates."
