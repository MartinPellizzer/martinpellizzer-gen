    "intro": "Blechnum niponicum f. flabellatum, commonly known as the Japanese holly fern, is a fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are leathery and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
