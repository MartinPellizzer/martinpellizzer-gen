It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. Breynia similis has a shallow root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its leaves can change color in response to environmental stress, such as drought or cold temperatures."
