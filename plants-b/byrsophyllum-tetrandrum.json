    "intro": "Byrsophyllum tetrandrum, commonly known as the diamond leaf or black diamond plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that often branches into a bushy form, covered in small, diamond-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element. Its leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture, adapted to store water in arid environments. It is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements."
