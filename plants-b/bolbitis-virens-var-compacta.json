    "intro": "Bolbitis virens var. compacta, commonly known as the compact fern, is a variety of the common water fern. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy fronds. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in moist woodlands. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
