    "intro": "Bauhinia multinervia, commonly known as the white bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring or early summer. Its fruits are woody pods that split open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. Bauhinia multinervia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
