    "intro": "Breweria aquatica, commonly known as water brewer's grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it reproduces both by seeds and vegetative propagation. Breweria aquatica plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
