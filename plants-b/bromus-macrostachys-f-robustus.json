It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil in various habitats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in panicles, with leathery, awned glumes that distinguish it from other brome species. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, showcasing its adaptability to different environmental conditions."
