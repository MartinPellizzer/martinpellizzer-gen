    "intro": "Bractearia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. Bractearia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. The flowers themselves are usually small and inconspicuous, with the true floral structures hidden beneath the vibrant bracts. This genus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
