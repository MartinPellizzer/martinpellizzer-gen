    "intro": "Boschniakia himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its long, slender stems and showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, Boschniakia himalaica is considered vulnerable and is often difficult to study in the wild."
