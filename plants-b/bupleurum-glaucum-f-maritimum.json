    "intro": "Bupleurum glaucum f. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal bupleurum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens along coastal areas."
