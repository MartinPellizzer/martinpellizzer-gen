    "intro": "Buxus crispa, commonly known as the crinkled boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that have a distinctive crinkled or wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form topiary shapes. Buxus crispa prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for landscaping."
