    "intro": "Blachia reflexa, commonly known as the creeping blachia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a waxy surface with a bluish-green hue. Small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ease of propagation."
