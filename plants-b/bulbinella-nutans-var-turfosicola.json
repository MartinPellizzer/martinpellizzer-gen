    "intro": "Bulbinella nutans var. turfosicola, commonly known as the turfy bulbinella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its arid or semi-arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. The variety is distinguished by its slightly more robust growth and broader leaves compared to the typical form of Bulbinella nutans."
