    "intro": "Bunium pinnatifolium, commonly known as the Siberian fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, ribbed fruit, and it is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Bunium pinnatifolium is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
