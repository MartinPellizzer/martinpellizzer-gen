    "intro": "Bromus transsilvanicus, commonly known as the Transylvanian brome, is a grass species native to Europe, particularly found in the Carpathian Mountains. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a rough texture, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. Bromus transsilvanicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
