    "intro": "Breynia granulosa, commonly known as the granular breynia, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, granular protrusions, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it can grow up to several meters in height. Breynia granulosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
