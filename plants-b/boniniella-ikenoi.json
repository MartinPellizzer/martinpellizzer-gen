    "intro": "Boniniella ikenoi, commonly known as the Ikenoi's boniniella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has a short stem and produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
