    "intro": "Bathiorhamnus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined buckthorn, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinct net-like venation pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Bathiorhamnus reticulatus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, through its fruit and habitat."
