    "intro": "Bolbitis copelandii, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a rare and striking fern native to the western coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically golden to bronze in color, which contrast beautifully with its dark green stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in coastal environments with high humidity and saline conditions, making it a unique addition to specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
