    "intro": "Bothriochloa edwardsiana, commonly known as Edwards' bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
