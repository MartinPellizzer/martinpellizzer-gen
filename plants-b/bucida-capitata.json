    "intro": "Bucida capitata, commonly known as the Cape coral tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom in clusters at the tips of the branches. These flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. Bucida capitata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a common ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
