    "intro": "Butea rosea, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its striking orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Butea rosea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
