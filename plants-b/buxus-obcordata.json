    "intro": "Buxus obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with oval, leathery leaves that are typically narrower than those of other boxwood species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Buxus obcordata is prized for its compact growth habit and is often used in formal gardens and topiary designs. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a versatile choice for ornamental landscaping."
