    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 bottnica, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between the white birch (Betula pendula) and the silver birch (Betula platyphylla). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring white to silver-colored bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree has slender, weeping branches and produces small, winged seeds in catkins. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and urban forestry."
