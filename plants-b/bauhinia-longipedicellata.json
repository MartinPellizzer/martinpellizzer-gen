    "intro": "Bauhinia longipedicellata, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in vibrant red or orange hues, often appearing in late winter or early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
