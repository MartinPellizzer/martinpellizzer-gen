    "intro": "Balsamorhiza macrophylla var. idahoensis, commonly known as the Idaho giant balsamroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, basal leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in length, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy yellow composite flowers in the summer, which are followed by pale brown, dandelion-like seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use by indigenous peoples."
