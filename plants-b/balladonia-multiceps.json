    "intro": "Balladonia multiceps, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that resembles a ghostly figure, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Balladonia multiceps is a rare and endangered species, often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly soils."
