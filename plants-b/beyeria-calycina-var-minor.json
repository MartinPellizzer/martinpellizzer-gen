    "intro": "Beyeria calycina var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf poinsettia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety red bracts that surround small, inconspicuous yellow flowers, which bloom during the winter months. The plant has a dense, bushy growth habit with glossy, dark green leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its vibrant bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a holiday plant due to its association with Christmas."
