    "intro": "Byrsonima guilleminiana var. arborescens, commonly known as the red mulberry, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often pubescent beneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in pendulous clusters, followed by edible, dark purple berries that are a source of nutrition for wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
