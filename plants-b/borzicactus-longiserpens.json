    "intro": "Borzicactus longiserpens, commonly known as the long-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the deserts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
