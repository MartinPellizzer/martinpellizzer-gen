It is characterized by its linear, slightly hairy leaves that give it a distinctive rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Buchnera linearis var. asperata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
