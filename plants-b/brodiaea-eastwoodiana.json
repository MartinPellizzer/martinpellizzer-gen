    "intro": "Brodiaea eastwoodiana, commonly known as Eastwood's brodiaea, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to California and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
