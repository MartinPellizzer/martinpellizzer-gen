It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes grass-like plants known as sedges. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Brachycorythis disoides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
