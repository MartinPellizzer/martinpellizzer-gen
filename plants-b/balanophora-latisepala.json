    "intro": "Balanophora latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled orchid, is a rare and mycoheterotrophic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrient uptake, making it a unique example of a parasitic orchid. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers with white or pale pink petals, typically arranged in a spike. Its roots are specialized for forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which provide essential nutrients. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Balanophora latisepala is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystems."
