    "intro": "Bulbophyllum avicella, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns resembling feathers. Its pseudobulbs are short and stout, storing water and nutrients for periods of drought. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful watering to prevent root rot."
