    "intro": "Bromelia gracilisepala, commonly known as the slender-winged bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Bromelia gracilisepala is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
