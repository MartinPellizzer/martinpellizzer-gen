    "intro": "Bromopsis inermis var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Bromopsis inermis var. hirta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
