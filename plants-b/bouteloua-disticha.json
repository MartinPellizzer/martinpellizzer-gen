    "intro": "Bouteloua disticha, commonly known as blue grama, is a native North American grass species that thrives in dry, open habitats. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils, making it an important component of native grasslands. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
