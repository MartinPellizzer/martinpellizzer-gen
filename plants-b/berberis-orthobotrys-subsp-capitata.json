    "intro": "Berberis orthobotrys subsp. capitata, commonly known as the clustered barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, clustered leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and seasonal flowering."
