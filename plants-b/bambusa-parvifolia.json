    "intro": "Bambusa parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a species of grass belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often arching culms. The plant produces small, pale green or white inflorescences that are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Bambusa parvifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, contributing to its aesthetic appeal in garden settings."
