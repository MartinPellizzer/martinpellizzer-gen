    "intro": "Baltimora trinervata, commonly known as the three-veined baltimora, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with three prominent veins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Baltimora trinervata is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. Its unique leaf venation pattern makes it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
