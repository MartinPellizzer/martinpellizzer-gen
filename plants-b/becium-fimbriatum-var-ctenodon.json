    "intro": "Becium fimbriatum var. ctenodon, commonly known as the fringed becium, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology. Its leaves are elongated and possess a finely serrated or fringed edge, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
