    "intro": "Blechnum columbiense, commonly known as the Columbia water fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky or disturbed soils. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
