It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic lifestyle. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water and nutrients, while its leaves are leathery and arranged in a rosette. The flowers bloom in summer and are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance."
