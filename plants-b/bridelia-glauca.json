    "intro": "Bridelia glauca, commonly known as the bluebridel or white bridle, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Bridelia glauca is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though its botanical properties remain largely under-researched."
