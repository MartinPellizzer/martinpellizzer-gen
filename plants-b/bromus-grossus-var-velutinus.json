    "intro": "Bromus grossus var. velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loosely branched spike with spikelets that are usually 5 to 7 mm long. Velvet brome is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
