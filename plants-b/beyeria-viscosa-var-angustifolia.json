It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can become a weed. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also noted for its ability to produce a sticky substance from its glandular surfaces."
