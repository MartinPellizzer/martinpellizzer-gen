It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels off in thin strips. The leaves are small, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, cylindrical pods containing flat, winged seeds. This species is adapted to seasonal climates and is often found in dry, open woodlands."
