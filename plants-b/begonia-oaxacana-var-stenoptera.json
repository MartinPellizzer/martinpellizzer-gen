    "intro": "Begonia oaxacana var. stenoptera, commonly known as the Oaxaca begonia, is a species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and red. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
