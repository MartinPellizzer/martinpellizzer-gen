    "intro": "Bromopsis erecta subsp. microchaeta, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
