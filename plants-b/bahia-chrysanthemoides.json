It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for erosion control and as a hardy ornamental plant."
