    "intro": "Botrychium silaifolium var. californicum, commonly known as the California moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are fern-like, with a complex structure that aids in photosynthesis and spore production. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
