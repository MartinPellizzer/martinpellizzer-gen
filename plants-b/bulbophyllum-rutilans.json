    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rutilans, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and dark green, often with a waxy texture. Bulbophyllum rutilans is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
