    "intro": "Barleria axillaris, commonly known as the creeping barleria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Barleria axillaris is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
