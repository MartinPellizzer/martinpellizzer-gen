    "intro": "Bursa occidentalis subsp. madeirae, commonly known as the Madeira burrs, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody fruits that resemble small burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or understorey habitats. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often producing a fragrant scent to attract pollinators."
