It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, often found in open areas with well-drained soil.

Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions."
