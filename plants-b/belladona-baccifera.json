    "intro": "Belladona baccifera, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, glossy berries that are highly poisonous, containing tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it thrives in shady, moist environments. Due to its potent toxins, it has a long history of use in both medicinal and nefarious contexts."
