    "intro": "Begonia divergens, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, often with a distinct reddish or purplish tint. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and container gardening. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense mats of foliage and blooms."
