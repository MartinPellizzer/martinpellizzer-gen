    "intro": "Brachypodium geniculatum, commonly known as the bent grass or zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzag or bent appearance, which gives it its common name. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Brachypodium geniculatum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
