    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rubrolineatum, commonly known as the red-lined orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with red or orange markings along the veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It is a lithophyte, meaning it typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, and requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
