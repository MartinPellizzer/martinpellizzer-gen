    "intro": "Bouteloua trifida var. burkii, commonly known as burkii bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green leaves and compact, tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This perennial grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and savanna habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to form dense stands make it an important component of native grasslands. The plant plays a crucial role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
