    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. distans, commonly known as the western maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to parts of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, pale underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
