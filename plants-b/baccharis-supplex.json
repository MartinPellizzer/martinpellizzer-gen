    "intro": "Baccharis supplex, commonly known as swamp baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Baccharis supplex is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to tolerate flooding."
