    "intro": "Bombax carolinum, commonly known as the cottonwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed pods. Its fibrous seeds are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplains."
