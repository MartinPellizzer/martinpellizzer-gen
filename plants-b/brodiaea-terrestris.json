    "intro": "Brodiaea terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial brodiaea, is a low-growing bulbous perennial native to California. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette near the ground. Its bulbs are adapted to survive dry periods, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens. Brodiaea terrestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in well-drained soils."
