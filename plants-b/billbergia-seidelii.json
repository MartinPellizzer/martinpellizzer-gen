    "intro": "Billbergia seidelii, commonly known as the Seidel's billbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts and yellow flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia seidelii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance."
