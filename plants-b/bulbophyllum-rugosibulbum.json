    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rugosibulbum, commonly known as the ridged bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical environments. Its leaves are typically leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns."
