    "intro": "Boronella francii, commonly known as the French boron plant, is a rare and unique species within the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are typically arranged in clusters. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly France and Italy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Boronella francii is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
