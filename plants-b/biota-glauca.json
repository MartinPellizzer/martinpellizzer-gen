    "intro": "Biota glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, fuzzy texture. Biota glauca is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
