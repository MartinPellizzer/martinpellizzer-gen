    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. floriferum, commonly known as the moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green, spore-bearing leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botrychium lunaria var. floriferum is a primitive vascular plant with a long evolutionary history, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
