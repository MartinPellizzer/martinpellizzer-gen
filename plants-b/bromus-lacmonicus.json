    "intro": "Bromus lacmonicus, commonly known as the lacmon grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that typically grow between 30 and 100 centimeters in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Bromus lacmonicus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
