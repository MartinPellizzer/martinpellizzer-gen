It features tall, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble lilies, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
