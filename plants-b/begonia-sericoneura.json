It is characterized by its attractive, velvety foliage and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
