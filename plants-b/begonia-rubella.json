    "intro": "Begonia rubella, commonly known as the crimson begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of about 1 to 2 feet. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native environment. Begonia rubella thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking colorful, low-maintenance plants."
