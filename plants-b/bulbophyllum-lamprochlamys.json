    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lamprochlamys, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it typically grows on rocks or tree trunks rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinctive, often fragrant structure. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in cultivation."
