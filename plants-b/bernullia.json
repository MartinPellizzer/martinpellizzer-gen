    "intro": "Bernullia, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plants are characterized by their evergreen foliage, with leathery, dark green leaves that often have a waxy coating. They produce showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically appearing in late spring. Bernullia species are generally low-growing, with a rhizomatous root system that allows them to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
