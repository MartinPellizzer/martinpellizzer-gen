    "intro": "Bignonia phaseoloides, commonly known as the evergreen crossvine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a woody vine characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bignonia phaseoloides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, flowering vine."
