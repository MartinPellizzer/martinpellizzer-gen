    "intro": "Brassica oleracea stirps botrytis, commonly known as cauliflower, is a cultivar of the cabbage family characterized by its compact, white curd formed by tightly packed flower buds. It is a biennial plant that typically completes its life cycle within two growing seasons, though it is often cultivated as an annual. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette around the central inflorescence. Its flowers are usually sterile, resulting in the distinctive head-like structure. Cauliflower is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and has been selectively bred for its unique appearance and culinary uses."
