    "intro": "Bromelia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Bromelia latifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
