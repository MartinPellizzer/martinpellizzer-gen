    "intro": "Bauhinia brachycarpa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The flowers are typically pale pink to white, clustered in racemes, and bloom during the rainy season. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
