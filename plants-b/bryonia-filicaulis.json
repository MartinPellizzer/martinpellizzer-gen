    "intro": "Bryonia filicaulis, commonly known as the common bryony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squash, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are lobed and can have a prickly texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Bryonia filicaulis is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
