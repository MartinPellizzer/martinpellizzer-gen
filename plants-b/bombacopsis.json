    "intro": "Bombacopsis, commonly known as the kapok tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers and fibrous, lightweight seed pods. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, buttressed trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. Its most notable feature is the production of silky, cotton-like fibers from its seeds, which have been historically used for insulation and textiles. The genus includes several species, such as Bombacopsis quinata and Bombacopsis rothmannii, which are valued for their ecological and economic importance."
