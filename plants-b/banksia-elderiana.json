    "intro": "Banksia elderiana, commonly known as the Elder's banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Banksia elderiana is adapted to fire-prone environments and often regenerates after bushfires. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native birds and insects."
