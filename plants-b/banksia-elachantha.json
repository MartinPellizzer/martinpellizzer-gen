    "intro": "Banksia elachantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. Banksia elachantha plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
