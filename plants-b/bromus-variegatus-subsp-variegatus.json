It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and presence of white or silver markings on the leaf blades. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear\u9896\u679c, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in some regions."
