It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
