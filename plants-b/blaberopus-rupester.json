    "intro": "Blaberopus rupester, commonly known as the rock beetlegourd, is a unique plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruit, which resembles a small gourd, is edible when ripe and has a mildly sweet, nutty flavor. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
