    "intro": "Brachystephanus roseus, commonly known as the rose-flowered stephanus, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compact growth habit and striking floral display. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, this plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers, which range from pink to lavender, are clustered in umbels and bloom during the cooler months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's foliage consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a subtle, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Brachystephanus roseus is a sought-after addition to rock gardens and native plant collections."
