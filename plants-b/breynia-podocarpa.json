    "intro": "Breynia podocarpa, commonly known as the red-breynia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy orange-red flowers. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, which is encased in a hard, woody shell. Breynia podocarpa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions for landscaping purposes."
