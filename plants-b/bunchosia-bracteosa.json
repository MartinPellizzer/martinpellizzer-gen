    "intro": "Bunchosia bracteosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its attractive, showy flowers that range from white to pink or red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Bunchosia bracteosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
