    "intro": "Brittonastrum betonicoides, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it produces a toxic sap that contains cardiac glycosides. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
