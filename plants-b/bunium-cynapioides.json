    "intro": "Bunium cynapioides, commonly known as poison hemlock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly cicutoxin, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and in fields. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a weed and requires caution during identification and handling."
