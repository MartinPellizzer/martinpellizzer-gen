    "intro": "Biscutella coronaria, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it has a sprawling growth habit. Biscutella coronaria is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
