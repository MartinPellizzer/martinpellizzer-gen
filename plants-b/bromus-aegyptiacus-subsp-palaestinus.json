It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological significance in local ecosystems."
