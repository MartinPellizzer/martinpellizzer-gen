    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. latisquama, commonly known as the downy birch with broad scales, is a variant of the downy birch characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are broad and have a serrated margin, with a pale green underside that contrasts with the darker upper surface. The plant is typically found in boreal and temperate regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This form is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
