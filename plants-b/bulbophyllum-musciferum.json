    "intro": "Bulbophyllum musciferum, commonly known as the mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique ability to form a dense mat of leaf-like structures that resemble moss, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. This species is often found in tropical rainforests and requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive."
