    "intro": "Bolbitis costulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces short, upright shoots, and its leaves are arranged in a rosette-like pattern. Bolbitis costulata is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
