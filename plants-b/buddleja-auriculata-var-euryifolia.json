    "intro": "Buddleja auriculata var. euryifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces panicles of fragrant, pale lavender to white flowers that bloom in summer. It is well-suited for garden use due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Buddleja auriculata var. euryifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil."
