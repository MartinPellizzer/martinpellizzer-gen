    "intro": "Begonia dispar, commonly known as the variable begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, pink, or white. The plant has heart-shaped to ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia dispar is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation indoors."
