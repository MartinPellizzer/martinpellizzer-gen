    "intro": "Berberis ilicina, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are dark green and oval-shaped, with a leathery texture. Berberis ilicina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
