It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
