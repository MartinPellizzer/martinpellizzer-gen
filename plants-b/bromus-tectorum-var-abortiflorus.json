    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. abortiflorus, commonly known as the Great Basin wild oat, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in certain regions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions."
