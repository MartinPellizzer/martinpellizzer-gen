    "intro": "Berberis haematocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and long-lasting berries."
