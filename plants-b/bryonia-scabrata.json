    "intro": "Bryonia scabrata, commonly known as the rough bryony, is a perennial climbing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and pumpkins, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to spiny, orange-red berries. Its roots and stems contain toxic compounds, including alkaloids, which have been used historically in traditional medicine. Bryonia scabrata thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils."
