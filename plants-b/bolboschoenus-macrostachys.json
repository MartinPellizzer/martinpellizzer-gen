    "intro": "Bolboschoenus macrostachys, commonly known as the broad-stalked bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often forming dense stands in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces large, showy panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Bolboschoenus macrostachys plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic wildlife."
