    "intro": "Baumia, commonly known as the \"scented orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Baumia species typically have sympodial growth patterns, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. They thrive in moist, well-drained soils and require partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
