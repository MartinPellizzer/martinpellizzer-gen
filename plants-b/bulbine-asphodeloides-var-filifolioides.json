It features rosettes of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
