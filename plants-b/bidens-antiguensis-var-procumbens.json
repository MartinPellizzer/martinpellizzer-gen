It features hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite or alternate along its stems. The plant produces small yellow flowers with prominent white markings, typically blooming from summer to fall. Its seeds are covered in fine hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks."
