    "intro": "Bombax brevicuspe, commonly known as the short-fruit cotton tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule. Its fibrous seeds are often used in traditional medicine, while the bark has been utilized for its tannins. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
