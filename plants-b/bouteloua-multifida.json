    "intro": "Bouteloua multifida, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and distinctive, feathery seed heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its slender, upright stems can reach heights of 2 to 4 feet, and it is well adapted to drought conditions. Silver bluestem plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
