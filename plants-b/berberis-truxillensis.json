    "intro": "Berberis truxillensis, commonly known as the Truxillensis barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
