    "intro": "Breynia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy breynia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Breynia hirsuta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
