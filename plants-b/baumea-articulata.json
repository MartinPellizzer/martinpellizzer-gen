    "intro": "Baumea articulata, commonly known as the silver grass or the glassworts, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. Baumea articulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. It is a valuable plant for ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
