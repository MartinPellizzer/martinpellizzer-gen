    "intro": "Bernardia peduncularis, commonly known as the red-flowered bernardia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
