    "intro": "Baeria aristata f. truncata, commonly known as the truncate baeria, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, truncate (cut-off) leaves that give it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
