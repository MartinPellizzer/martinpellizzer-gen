    "intro": "Biscutella apula f. ciliata, commonly known as the Ciliated Biscutella, is a rare and delicate plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cress plants, and is characterized by its small, white flowers and finely serrated leaves. The species is notable for its hairy, ciliate margins on the leaves, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
