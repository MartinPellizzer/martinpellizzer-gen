    "intro": "Bartonia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf bartonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Bartonia lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in wet garden settings."
