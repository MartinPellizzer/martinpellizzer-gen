    "intro": "Berlandiera pumila var. dealbata, commonly known as the white mistflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
