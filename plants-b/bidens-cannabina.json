    "intro": "Bidens cannabina, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it cling to vegetation. The plant produces numerous seeds with tufts of hair that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in many regions."
