It is native to South America, particularly the Andean regions, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce pods that contain seeds. Balizia species are often found in mountainous areas and are adapted to cooler, high-altitude climates. They play an important role in local ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
