    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. degeneri, commonly known as the downy brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often form dense colonies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough, hairy texture on the underside. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive weed in many regions."
