    "intro": "Bidens speciosa var. patula, commonly known as the showy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats like wetlands and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
