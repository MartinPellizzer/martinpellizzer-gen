    "intro": "Baumea johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's baumea, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream margins and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
