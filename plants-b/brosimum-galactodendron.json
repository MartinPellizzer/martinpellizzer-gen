    "intro": "Brosimum galactodendron, commonly known as the white mulberry, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish down. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, fleshy berries that turn red when ripe. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is valued for its fruit, which is used in traditional medicine and as a food source for both humans and animals."
