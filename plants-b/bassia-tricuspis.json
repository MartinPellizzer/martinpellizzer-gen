    "intro": "Bassia tricuspis, commonly known as three-lobed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically triangular or three-lobed in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Bassia tricuspis plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert environments and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
