    "intro": "Brachypodium kotschyi, commonly known as Kotschyi's goatgrass, is a flowering plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Brachypodium kotschyi is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open fields and along coastal areas."
