It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically at night. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
