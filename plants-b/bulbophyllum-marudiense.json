    "intro": "Bulbophyllum marudiense, commonly known as the Marudi orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Borneo. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland rainforests. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
