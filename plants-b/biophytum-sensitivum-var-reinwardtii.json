    "intro": "Biophytum sensitivum var. reinwardtii, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This species is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and rapid growth habit."
