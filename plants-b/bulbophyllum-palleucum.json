    "intro": "Bulbophyllum palleucum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white, leaf-like structures that resemble leaves but are actually modified stems. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle iridescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
