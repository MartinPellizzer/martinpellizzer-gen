    "intro": "Barringtonia dentata, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. The fruit is a rough, spiky capsule that splits open to release the edible, white, fleshy aril surrounding the seeds. The plant has a distinctive branching structure and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Its leaves are large, simple, and have a waxy texture, typical of many tropical species."
