    "intro": "Baptisia \u00d7 fulva, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and showy, spires of yellow or orange flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its deep root system makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for sandy or well-drained soils. Baptisia \u00d7 fulva is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
