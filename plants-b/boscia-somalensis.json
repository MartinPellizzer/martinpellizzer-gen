    "intro": "Boscia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali boscia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Boscia somalensis plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine by some communities."
