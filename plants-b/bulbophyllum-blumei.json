    "intro": "Bulbophyllum blumei, commonly known as the Blume's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often branched growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. It is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
