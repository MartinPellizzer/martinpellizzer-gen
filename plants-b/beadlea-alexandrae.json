    "intro": "Beadlea alexandrae, commonly known as the Alexandra's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that are adapted to its cold, arid environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Beadlea alexandrae is a perennial herb that thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a notable species in the study of Andean flora."
