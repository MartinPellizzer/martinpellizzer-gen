    "intro": "Bobua morrisonicola, commonly known as the Morrison's bobua, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a glossy surface, typical of many rainforest species. Bobua morrisonicola is often found growing in shaded, moist environments, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
