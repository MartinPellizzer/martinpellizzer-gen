    "intro": "Bouteloua williamsii, commonly known as Williams' bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southwestern United States. It typically grows in open prairies and dry, sandy soils, thriving in full sun. The plant has slender, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable in native grasslands. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to establish quickly."
