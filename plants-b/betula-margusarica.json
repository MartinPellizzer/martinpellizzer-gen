    "intro": "Betula margusarica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellow or cream-colored inner layer. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula margusarica is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in taiga and subarctic regions."
