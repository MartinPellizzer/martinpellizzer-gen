    "intro": "Balanopteris minor, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Balanopteris minor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
