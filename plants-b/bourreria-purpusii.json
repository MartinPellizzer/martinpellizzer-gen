    "intro": "Bourreria purpusii, commonly known as the Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair that helps reduce water loss."
