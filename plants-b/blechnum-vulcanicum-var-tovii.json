    "intro": "Blechnum vulcanicum var. tovii, commonly known as the Tovian harts-tongue fern, is a rare and unique variant of the harts-tongue fern genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, leathery fronds that resemble the shape of a harts-tongue, a historical heraldic symbol. The plant is native to specific regions in New Zealand, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage is typically dark green and exhibits a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
