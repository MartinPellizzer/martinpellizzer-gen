    "intro": "Blepharis fruticulosa, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the late afternoon and evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in sandy or rocky soils."
