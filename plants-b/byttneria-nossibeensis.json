It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and alternate, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to reveal edible seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, fibrous pulp and are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
