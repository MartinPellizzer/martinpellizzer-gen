    "intro": "Bryophyllum streptanthum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is native to South Africa. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Bryophyllum streptanthum is also noted for its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings, which is a common feature among many succulents."
