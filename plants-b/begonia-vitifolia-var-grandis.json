    "intro": "Begonia vitifolia var. grandis, commonly known as the giant leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The foliage is typically a deep green with a velvety texture, and the plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shaded garden areas or as a houseplant."
