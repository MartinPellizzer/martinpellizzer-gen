The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural applications."
