It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five petals and a pair of bracts that resemble ticks, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically oval or lance-shaped. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Bidens cognata is an annual herb that produces seeds with small tufts, aiding in its dispersal by wind."
