It is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red berries, which contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often with a distinctive marbled pattern, giving it its common name. Bryonia marmorata is typically found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
