It has small, oval leaves that are typically hairy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. Its bark is thin and peels in strips, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. This hardy species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions."
