    "intro": "Bletia digbyana, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a compact rosette of dark green, strap-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often clustered in a loose inflorescence. Bletia digbyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
