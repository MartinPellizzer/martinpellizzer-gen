    "intro": "Bulbophyllum ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which are often pale yellow or greenish-white, bloom during the wet season and attract various pollinators."
