    "intro": "Bulliarda decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bulliard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Bulliarda decumbens is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
