    "intro": "Brillantaisia oligantha, commonly known as the dwarf bristle grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tufted, fine leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a bristly appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or brown, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscaping."
