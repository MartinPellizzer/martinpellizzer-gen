    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the typical mouse-ear fern, is a small, delicate fern native to North America. It features a unique frond structure with a short, upright stipe and a broad, pinnate blade that is often divided into multiple segments. The fronds are typically gray-green in color and have a velvety texture. It produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, clustered pattern. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
