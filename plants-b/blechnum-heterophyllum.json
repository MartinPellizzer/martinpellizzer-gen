    "intro": "Blechnum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The plant's adaptability to various soil types makes it a resilient and widespread species in its native range."
