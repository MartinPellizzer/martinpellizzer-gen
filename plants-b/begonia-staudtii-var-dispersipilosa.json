    "intro": "Begonia staudtii var. dispersipilosa, commonly known as the spreading-leaved begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often a deep green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation."
