    "intro": "Banksia ciliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain numerous seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Banksia ciliata plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native animals."
