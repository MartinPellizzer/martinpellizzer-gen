    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sceliphron, commonly known as the sword-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom during the rainy season, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
