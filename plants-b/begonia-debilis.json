    "intro": "Begonia debilis, commonly known as the wax plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often emerging from the leaf axils. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia debilis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
