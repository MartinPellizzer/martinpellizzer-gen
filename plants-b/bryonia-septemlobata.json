    "intro": "Bryonia septemlobata, commonly known as the seven-lobed bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers with five lobes, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
