    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pallescens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly shapes. Its unique growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions."
