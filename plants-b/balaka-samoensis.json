    "intro": "Balaka samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan balaka, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savai\u2019i in Samoa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
