    "intro": "Begonia extranea, commonly known as the rare tropical begonia, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to bright orange. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by experienced growers."
