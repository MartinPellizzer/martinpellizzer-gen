    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 alpestris var. communis, commonly known as the silver birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver hue, and its slender, graceful branches. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, triangular leaves that turn gold in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The silver birch is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions."
