    "intro": "Buxus rivularis, commonly known as the river boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It typically reaches a height of about 1 meter and has dense, compact foliage composed of small, leathery, dark green leaves. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in stream banks and woodland edges. Its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. Buxus rivularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
