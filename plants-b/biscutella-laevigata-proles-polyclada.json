It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds.
