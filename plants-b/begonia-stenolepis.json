    "intro": "Begonia stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
