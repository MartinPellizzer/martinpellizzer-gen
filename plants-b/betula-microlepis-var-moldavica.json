    "intro": "Betula microlepis var. moldavica, commonly known as the Moldavian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
