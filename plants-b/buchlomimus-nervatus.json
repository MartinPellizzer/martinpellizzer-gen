    "intro": "Buchlomimus nervatus, commonly known as the slender-veined fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, parallel veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Buchlomimus nervatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
