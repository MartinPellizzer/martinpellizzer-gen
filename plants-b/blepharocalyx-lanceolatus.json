It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
