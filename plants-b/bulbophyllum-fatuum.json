    "intro": "Bulbophyllum fatuum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, featuring elongated, pale green pseudobulbs and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
