    "intro": "Bromus pubescens f. glabriflorus, commonly known as the glabrous-flowered brome, is a botanical variant of the common brome grass. It is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence and a more slender, less hairy inflorescence compared to the typical form. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowering stems are typically shorter and more compact, with reduced bracts. The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphological features."
