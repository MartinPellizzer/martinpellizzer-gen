    "intro": "Bolbitis sinuosa var. sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
