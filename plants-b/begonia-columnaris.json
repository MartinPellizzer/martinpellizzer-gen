    "intro": "Begonia columnaris, commonly known as the columnar begonia, is a tropical plant characterized by its upright, cane-like stems. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
