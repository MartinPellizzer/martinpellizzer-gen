    "intro": "Brachypodium divaricatum, commonly known as little barley, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing annual plant with slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology research."
