    "intro": "Buxus stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of other boxwood species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is valued for its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
