    "intro": "Bermudiana secundiflora, commonly known as the Bermuda buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Bermuda. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and is often found growing in sandy soils along the shorelines. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a symbol of Bermuda's natural heritage."
