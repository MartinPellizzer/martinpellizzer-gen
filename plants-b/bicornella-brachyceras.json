It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its name refers to the two horns on the fruit and the short, broad shape of the capsule.
