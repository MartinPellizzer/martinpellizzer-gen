    "intro": "Brunsvigia humilis, commonly known as the rainstorm lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of dormancy to bloom successfully. Brunsvigia humilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
