    "intro": "Bonnaya brachiata var. radicata, commonly known as the creeping bonnaya, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are elliptical, slightly hairy, and have a soft, velvety texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
