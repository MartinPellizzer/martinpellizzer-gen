    "intro": "Bromus racemosus var. pratorum, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with ascending or spreading leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets. The flowers are small and wind-pollinated, with pale green to brown glumes. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
