    "intro": "Betula pavlovii var. sagliana, commonly known as the Sichuan birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, weeping form and striking white to pale pink bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth margin, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
