    "intro": "Bupleurum kohistanicum, commonly known as Kohistan angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and northern India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
