It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its natural habitat. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators with their vibrant hues."
