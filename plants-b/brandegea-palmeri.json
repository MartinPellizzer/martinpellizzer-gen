    "intro": "Brandegea palmeri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Brandegea palmeri is often found in sandy or rocky soils in desert regions."
