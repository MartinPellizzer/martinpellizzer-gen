    "intro": "Begonia makrinii, commonly known as the Makrinii begonia, is a tropical plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink and white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
