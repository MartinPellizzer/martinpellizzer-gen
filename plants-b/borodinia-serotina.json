    "intro": "Borodinia serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering borodinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green to brownish flowers that bloom late in the growing season, usually from late summer to autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Borodinia serotina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique flowering display."
