    "intro": "Brunnera macrophylla var. glabrescens, commonly known as Siberian bugloss, is a perennial plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or lavender flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
