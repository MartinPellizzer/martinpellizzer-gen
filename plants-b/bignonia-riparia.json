It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers are rich in nectar and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia riparia is often found in moist, sunny habitats like streambanks and woodland edges."
