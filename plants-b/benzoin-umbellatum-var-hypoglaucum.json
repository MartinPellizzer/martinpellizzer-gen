    "intro": "Benzoin umbellatum var. hypoglaucum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved benzoin, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous bark and leaves that are typically narrow and glaucous. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Rubiaceae family. Its resin, known as benjamin, is harvested from the bark and used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The varietal name 'hypoglaucum' refers to its less waxy appearance compared to other varieties."
