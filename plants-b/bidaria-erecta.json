    "intro": "Bidaria erecta, commonly known as the upright bidaria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bidaria erecta is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is not widely cultivated but is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
