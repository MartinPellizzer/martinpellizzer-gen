    "intro": "Brachystemum virginicum, commonly known as the Virginia bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. Brachystemum virginicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
