    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, distinguishing it from other birch species. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in cone-like structures, which are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
