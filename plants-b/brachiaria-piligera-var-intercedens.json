    "intro": "Brachiaria piligera var. intercedens, commonly known as the narrowleaf signalgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions."
