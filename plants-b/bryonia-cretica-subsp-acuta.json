    "intro": "Bryonia cretica subsp. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-britched bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its tendrils and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are followed by orange, spiny fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for human consumption but is of interest in botanical and ecological studies."
