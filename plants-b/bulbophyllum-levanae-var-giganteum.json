    "intro": "Bulbophyllum levanae var. giganteum, commonly known as the Giant Levana's Bulbophyllum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and vibrant colors make it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in controlled environments for conservation efforts."
