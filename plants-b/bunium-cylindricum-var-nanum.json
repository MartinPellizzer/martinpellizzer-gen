    "intro": "Bunium cylindricum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf silphium, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom in early summer. Its fibrous root system is notable for its strong, aromatic odor, characteristic of the Apiaceae family. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
