    "intro": "Bromus velutinus var. nitidus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of hair. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three flowering glumes, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Bromus velutinus var. nitidus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock."
