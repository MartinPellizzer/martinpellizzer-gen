    "intro": "Besleria seitzii, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, zebra-like patterns on its leaves, which feature alternating light and dark green stripes. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange throat. It thrives in humid, well-drained environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
