    "intro": "Blepharis spinescens, commonly known as the spiny blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert environments. Blepharis spinescens is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
