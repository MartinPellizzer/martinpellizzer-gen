    "intro": "Bacopa acuminata var. peninsularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
