    "intro": "Bellevalia hermonis, commonly known as the Hermon bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate blue to violet flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes other bellflowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
