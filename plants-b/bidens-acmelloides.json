    "intro": "Bidens acmelloides, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers with five petals. The plant produces seeds with bristly structures that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
