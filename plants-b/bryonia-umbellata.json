    "intro": "Bryonia umbellata, commonly known as the common beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a fine, white powder. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption or medicinal use."
