    "intro": "Betula fusca, commonly known as the black birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that becomes more prominent with age. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Betula fusca typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
