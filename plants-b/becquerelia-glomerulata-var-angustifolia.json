It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, this plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture, and it often grows in rocky soils. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
