    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. cordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped moonwort, is a small fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
