    "intro": "Begonia microphylla var. major, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This variety is popular in tropical gardens and as a houseplant due to its dramatic foliage and long blooming period."
