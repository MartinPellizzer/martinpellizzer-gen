    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rosemarianum, commonly known as the rosemarian orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that resemble rose petals, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically green and strap-like, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. This orchid is popular among hobbyists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
