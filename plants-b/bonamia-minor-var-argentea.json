    "intro": "Bonamia minor var. argentea, commonly known as silver bonamia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and also covered in fine, silky white pubescence. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
