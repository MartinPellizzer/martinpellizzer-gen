    "intro": "Bicornella ampullacea, commonly known as the two-horned bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are often submerged, and it uses specialized bladder cells to capture tiny aquatic organisms. Bicornella ampullacea is notable for its unique morphology and its adaptation to nutrient-deficient habitats."
