    "intro": "Begonia lipingensis, commonly known as the Liping begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to China. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often bi-colored leaves. The plant features showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
