    "intro": "Bergia ammannioides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky coastal areas. It has small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in harsh, coastal conditions. Bergia ammannioides is often found in Mediterranean and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa."
