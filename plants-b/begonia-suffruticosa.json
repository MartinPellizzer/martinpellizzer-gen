    "intro": "Begonia suffruticosa, commonly known as the coral vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, bright red flowers that resemble coral. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia suffruticosa is popular in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and trailing habit."
