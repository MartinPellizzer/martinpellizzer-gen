    "intro": "Brachyglottis hectorii, commonly known as Hector's brachyglottis, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland shrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
