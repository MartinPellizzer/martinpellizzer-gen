    "intro": "Batrachium \u00d7 algidum, commonly known as the cold mountain fern, is a hybrid species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow under moonlight. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it forms dense, low-growing colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its unique adaptations, Batrachium \u00d7 algidum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
