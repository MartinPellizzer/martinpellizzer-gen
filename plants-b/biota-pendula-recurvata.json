    "intro": "Biota pendula recurvata, commonly known as the hanging biota or recurved biota, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in humid environments and requires support for its climbing habit. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
