    "intro": "Beaufortia macrostemon var. incana, commonly known as the woolly beaufortia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low water requirement, making it suitable for dryland gardens. The leaves are often leathery and arranged in pairs along the stems, contributing to its drought tolerance."
