    "intro": "Blepharis inermis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert environments. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
