    "intro": "Brachyramphus popovii, commonly known as the Steller's sea eagle, is a large sea eagle native to the coastal regions of the North Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive black and white plumage, with a pale yellow beak and yellow eyes. The plant is not a botanical species but a bird, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
