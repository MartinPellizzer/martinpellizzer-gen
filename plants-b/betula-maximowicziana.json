    "intro": "Betula maximowicziana, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and pink, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Betula maximowicziana is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures."
