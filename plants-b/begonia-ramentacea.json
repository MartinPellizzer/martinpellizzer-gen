    "intro": "Begonia ramentacea, commonly known as the woolly begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
