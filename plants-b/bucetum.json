    "intro": "Bucetum, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Bucetum is often found in peat bogs and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
