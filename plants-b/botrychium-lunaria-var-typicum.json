It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped sporangia that are clustered in a dense, club-like structure on the underside of its fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually divided into two parts, with the lower leaf being larger and more lobed. Botrychium lunaria var. typicum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and ancient species with a unique reproductive structure."
