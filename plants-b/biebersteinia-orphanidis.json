    "intro": "Biebersteinia orphanidis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stem and small, delicate flowers that often resemble the shape of a ghostly face. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Biebersteinia orphanidis is considered a critically endangered species."
