    "intro": "Banara tulasnei, commonly known as the Tulasne's banara, is a rare and woody shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, dry fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
