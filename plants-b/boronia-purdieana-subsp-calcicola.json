    "intro": "Boronia purdieana subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola boronia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South Australia. It thrives in sandy, calcareous soils and is adapted to the dry, saline conditions of its habitat. The plant features small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting native pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a compact growth habit. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally restricted species."
