It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for hedges and topiary. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, and it is relatively drought tolerant once established. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
