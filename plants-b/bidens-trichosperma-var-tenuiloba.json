    "intro": "Bidens trichosperma var. tenuiloba, commonly known as slenderleaf beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as roadsides and wetlands, and it has slender, branching stems with opposite, linear leaves. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
