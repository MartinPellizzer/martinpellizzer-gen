    "intro": "Barringtonia balansae, commonly known as the Balansae lantern tree, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, lantern-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant produces a distinctive fruit that splits open to release its seeds, often with a strong scent to attract seed dispersers. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Barringtonia balansae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
