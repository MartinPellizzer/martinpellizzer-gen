It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in racemes. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has become invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
