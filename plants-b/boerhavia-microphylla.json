    "intro": "Boerhavia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved bluestem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb with slender stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in poor, sandy soils. Boerhavia microphylla is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
