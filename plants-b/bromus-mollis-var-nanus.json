    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, forming dense, mat-like growth that thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its fine, grass-like leaves are often covered in a soft, fuzzy coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bromus mollis var. nanus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry, rocky environments."
