    "intro": "Berlinia craibiana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous, hairy coating. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils in dry to moist forest habitats. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, Berlinia craibiana is often threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
