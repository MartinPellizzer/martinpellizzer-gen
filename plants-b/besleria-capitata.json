    "intro": "Besleria capitata, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble flames. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often clustered in a spike at the top of the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
