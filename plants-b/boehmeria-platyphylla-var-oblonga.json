It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fibrous stems have been historically used for making textiles and paper."
