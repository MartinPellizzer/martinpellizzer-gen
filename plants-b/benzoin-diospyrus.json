    "intro": "Benzoin diospyrus, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or tamarind tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits resembling small tamarinds. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to exude a fragrant resin, which has been used traditionally in incense and medicine. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in tropical forests."
