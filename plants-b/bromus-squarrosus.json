    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and rough, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Bromus squarrosus is an important forage plant for livestock and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
