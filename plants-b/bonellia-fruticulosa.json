    "intro": "Bonellia fruticulosa, commonly known as the tropical flowering plant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family, known for its ornamental value. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots system is fibrous, which helps it anchor in nutrient-poor soils. Bonellia fruticulosa is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
