    "intro": "Baumea planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf baumea, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Baumea planifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in its native environment."
