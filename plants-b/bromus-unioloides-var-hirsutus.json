    "intro": "Bromus unioloides var. hirsutus, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its role in stabilizing soils in native plant communities."
