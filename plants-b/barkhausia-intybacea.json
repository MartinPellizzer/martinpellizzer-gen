It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to anchor firmly in its environment. The botanical features of Barkhausia intybacea make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological studies."
