    "intro": "Brayopsis alpaminae subsp. alpaminae, commonly known as the alpine brayopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species native to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme environments. Due to its fragility and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species."
