    "intro": "Bromopsis arctica var. alpina, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
