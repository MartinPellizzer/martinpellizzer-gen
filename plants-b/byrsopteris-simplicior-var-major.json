It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant is notable for its prehistoric appearance and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
