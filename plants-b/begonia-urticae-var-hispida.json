    "intro": "Begonia urticae var. hispida, commonly known as the stinging nettle begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact, similar to the stinging nettle. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and delicate blooms."
