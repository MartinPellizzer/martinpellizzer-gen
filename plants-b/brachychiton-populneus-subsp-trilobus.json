    "intro": "Brachychiton populneus subsp. trilobus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bottle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fluted trunk and pinnately compound leaves with three leaflets. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in spring. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. The subspecies is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established."
