    "intro": "Bombax barrigon, commonly known as the Barrigon cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture and a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
