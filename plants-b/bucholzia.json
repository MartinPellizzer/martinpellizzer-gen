It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Africa. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and showy, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Bucholzia species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They play a role in local ecosystems and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes."
