    "intro": "Bidens frondosa var. major, commonly known as the largeleaf beggarlice, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom from summer to fall. The plant produces numerous seeds enclosed in bracts, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an aggressive weed in various ecological settings."
