    "intro": "Begonia wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, heart-shaped leaves and showy, bright red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to produce numerous seedlings from the base, contributing to its ease of propagation."
