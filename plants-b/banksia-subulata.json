    "intro": "Banksia subulata, commonly known as the needle banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces large, cone-like inflorescences that are composed of numerous small, yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. Banksia subulata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
