    "intro": "Banisteria campestris var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous banisteria, is a tropical vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a distinctive whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange-red fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is sometimes grown in botanical gardens."
