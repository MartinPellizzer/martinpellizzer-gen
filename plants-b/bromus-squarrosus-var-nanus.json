    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf silky brome, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, silver-haired leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
