    "intro": "Bromus rigidus var. maximus, commonly known as the rigid brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus rigidus var. maximus is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
