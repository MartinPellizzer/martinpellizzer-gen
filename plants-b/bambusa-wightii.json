    "intro": "Bambusa wightii, commonly known as the bamboo of the Himalayas, is a tall, clumping bamboo species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with a smooth, light green to grayish-brown surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a fan-like pattern at the nodes. Its rhizomes are robust and help in the propagation of the plant through underground growth. Bambusa wightii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and traditional construction."
