    "intro": "Benthamiella azorelloides, commonly known as the Azorean benthamiella, is a rare and endemic flowering plant found exclusively in the Azores. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, thriving in the unique microclimates of the island's volcanic terrain. Its botanical features include simple leaves and a short, compact growth form, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
