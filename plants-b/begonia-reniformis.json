    "intro": "Begonia reniformis, commonly known as the kidney-shaped begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in the spring and summer. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
