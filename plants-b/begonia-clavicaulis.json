    "intro": "Begonia clavicaulis, commonly known as the club-stem begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, velvety leaves with a distinctive club-shaped stem, which is a key identifying feature. Its flowers are typically small and borne in clusters, often in shades of red, pink, or white. Begonia clavicaulis is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
