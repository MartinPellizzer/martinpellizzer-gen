It is characterized by its elongated, slender body and typically metallic green or blue coloration. This beetle is often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its larvae, known as water beetles, are aquatic and play a role in the food web by feeding on small invertebrates. The adult beetles are predatory, contributing to the control of insect populations in their ecosystems."
