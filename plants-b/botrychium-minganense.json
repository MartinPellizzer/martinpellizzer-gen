    "intro": "Botrychium minganense, commonly known as the Mingan moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, short, and often curved fertile frond that produces spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It is native to eastern North America, particularly in regions like Quebec and Labrador. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
