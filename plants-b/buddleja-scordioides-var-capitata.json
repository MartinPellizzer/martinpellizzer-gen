    "intro": "Buddleja scordioides var. capitata, commonly known as the clustered butterfly bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, round, greenish-yellow fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for gardens in warm climates. Its ornamental value comes from its showy inflorescences and its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
