It is characterized by its striking red-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a support for trellises."
