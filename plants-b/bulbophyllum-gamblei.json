    "intro": "Bulbophyllum gamblei, commonly known as the Gambles' orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded conditions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to yellow and orange."
