    "intro": "Bromus pentastachyos, commonly known as the six-awned brome, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces spikelets with six awns, giving it its common name, and its leaves are typically narrow and hairy. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bromus pentastachyos is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
