    "intro": "Besleria bicolor, commonly known as the red-tipped begonia, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are dark green with a distinctive red or purple margin. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the year under suitable conditions. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
