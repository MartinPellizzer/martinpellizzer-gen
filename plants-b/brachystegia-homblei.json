It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and forest habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
