It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
