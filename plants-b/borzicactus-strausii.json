    "intro": "Borzicactus strausii, commonly known as the Straus's cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered in dense, white spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at night to attract nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
