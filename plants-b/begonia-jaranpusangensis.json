    "intro": "Begonia jaranpusangensis, commonly known as the Jaranpusang begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Thailand. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that exhibit a deep green color with intricate vein patterns. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
