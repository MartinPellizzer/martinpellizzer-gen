    "intro": "Byrsonima coriacea var. spicata, commonly known as the spiny cacao or spiny ackee, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces fruits that are typically green, with a spiny exterior and a soft, sweet pulp inside. It is often found in dry to moist forests and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The botanical features of this species make it an important plant in both ecological and traditional contexts."
