    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. confertus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color that distinguishes it from other brome species. This grass is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
