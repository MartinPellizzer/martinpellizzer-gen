It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often accompanied by bracts that resemble small leaves.

This species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth."
