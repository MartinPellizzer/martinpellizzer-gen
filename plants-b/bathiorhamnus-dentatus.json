    "intro": "Bathiorhamnus dentatus, commonly known as the toothed hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Bathiorhamnus dentatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for birds and wildlife."
