    "intro": "Bactris hirta var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy palm, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized palm tree characterized by its short trunk and pinnate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling small coconuts. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in tropical gardens. Its growth habit and unique foliage make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
