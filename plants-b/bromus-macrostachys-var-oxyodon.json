    "intro": "Bromus macrostachys var. oxyodon, commonly known as the long-stalked brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence is a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is known for its adaptability to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
