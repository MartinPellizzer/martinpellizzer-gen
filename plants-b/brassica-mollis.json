    "intro": "Brassica mollis, commonly known as the woolly mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides or in dry meadows. The plant produces small, round pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
