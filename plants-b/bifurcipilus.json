    "intro": "Bifurcipilus, commonly known as the forked-leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its distinctive bifurcated fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, bipinnate leaves that often split into two branches near the base. Its botanical structure supports its role as an epiphytic species, growing on trees in humid environments. The fronds are typically green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
