    "intro": "Bilabrella sochensis, commonly known as the Sochensis bilabrella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique bilabiate (two-lipped) flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
