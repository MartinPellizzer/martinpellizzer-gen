    "intro": "Betula odorata var. tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted birch, is a variant of the sweet birch species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, twisted trunk and branches, which give it a unique, ornamental appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The bark of this variety is smooth and pale, with a subtle fragrance when shaved."
