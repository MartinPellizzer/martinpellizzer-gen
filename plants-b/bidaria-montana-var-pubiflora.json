    "intro": "Bidaria montana var. pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered bidaria, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, while the flowers are clustered in dense, panicle-like structures. This variety is distinguished by its hairy bracts, which give it its common name. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
