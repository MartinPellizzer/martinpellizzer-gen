    "intro": "Breynia saksenana, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage that gives it a striking appearance. The plant has small, pale green leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red berries. Breynia saksenana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
