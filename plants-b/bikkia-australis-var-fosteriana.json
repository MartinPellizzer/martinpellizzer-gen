    "intro": "Bikkia australis var. fosteriana, commonly known as the coastal bikkia, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are white or pale blue, with five petals and a distinctive yellow center, blooming in spring. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
