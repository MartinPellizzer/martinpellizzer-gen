    "intro": "Bidayuha, commonly known as the \"wild rice\" or *Oryza barbata*, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found along riverbanks and in flooded fields. Its seeds are edible and have been used traditionally by indigenous communities for food and medicinal purposes. Bidayuha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
