It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive silver veins that contrast beautifully with its deep green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
