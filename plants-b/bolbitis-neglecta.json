    "intro": "Bolbitis neglecta, commonly known as the neglected fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shaded rock crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Bolbitis neglecta is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in cool, humid climates."
