    "intro": "Bambusa arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem bamboo, is a tall, clumping bamboo species native to northern Australia. It features slender, green culms that can grow up to 6 meters in height, with a smooth, often slightly hairy surface. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and arranged in a fan-like pattern at the nodes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bambusa arnhemica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and as a source of sustainable materials."
