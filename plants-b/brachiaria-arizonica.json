It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Arizona grass is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
