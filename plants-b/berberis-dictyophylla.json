It features small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and its flowers are yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring. The plant produces red berries that are edible but often have a sharp, acidic flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
