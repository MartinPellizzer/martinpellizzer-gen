    "intro": "Baeothryon subcapitatum, commonly known as the small-headed bryophyte, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with closely spaced, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, waxy cells. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and produce spores for dispersal. Baeothryon subcapitatum is an important component of bryophyte communities and contributes to soil stabilization in its habitat."
