    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum var. typicum, commonly known as the dissected moonwort, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its leaves are finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance, and it often grows close to the ground. This variant is distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other forms of Botrychium."
