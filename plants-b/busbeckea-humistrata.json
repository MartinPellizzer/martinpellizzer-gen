    "intro": "Busbeckea humistrata, commonly known as the coastal lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth habit is usually low and spreading, forming dense mats that help stabilize dune environments. Busbeckea humistrata is an important part of the coastal flora, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
