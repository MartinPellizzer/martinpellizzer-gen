    "intro": "Bouteloua pendula, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is a perennial bunchgrass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant has narrow, bluish-gray leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like seed heads that are distinctive and often used in floral arrangements. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soils in arid environments. Blue grama is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
