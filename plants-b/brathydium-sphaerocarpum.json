    "intro": "Brathydium sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe-stemmed liverwort, is a small, perennial plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. The plant has a distinctive stem that is spherical or nearly spherical in cross-section, giving it its common name. Its leaves are closely arranged and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Brathydium sphaerocarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
