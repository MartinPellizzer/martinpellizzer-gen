    "intro": "Bactris grayumii, commonly known as the gray palm, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, sweet, and fibrous fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional crafts, and the fruit is valued for its nutritional content. Bactris grayumii thrives in moist, tropical environments and is adapted to coastal and lowland habitats."
