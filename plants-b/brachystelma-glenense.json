    "intro": "Brachystelma glenense, commonly known as the Glen's ghost flower, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, known for its unique adaptations to arid environments. It is a succulent plant with fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small scales, further minimizing water loss. Native to South Africa, it is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils."
