    "intro": "Bromelia palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. The leaves are typically green to blue-green in color and have a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments."
