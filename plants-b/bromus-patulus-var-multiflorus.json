    "intro": "Bromus patulus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multibloom brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. The flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer, making it a valuable component of native plant communities."
