    "intro": "Becquerelia glomerulata f. minuta, commonly known as the dwarf becquerelia, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It features small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its textured appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
