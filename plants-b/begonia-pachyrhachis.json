    "intro": "Begonia pachyrhachis, commonly known as the giant begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation and indoor gardening."
