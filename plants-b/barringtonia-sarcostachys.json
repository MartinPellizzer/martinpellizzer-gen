It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind or water. The plant has a smooth, greyish bark and can grow up to 15 meters tall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some regions."
