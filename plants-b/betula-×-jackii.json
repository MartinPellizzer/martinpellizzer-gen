    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 jackii, commonly known as the hybrid birch, is a cross between Betula pendula (silver birch) and Betula pubescens (downy birch). It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its white, peeling bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and forest edges. Betula \u00d7 jackii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
