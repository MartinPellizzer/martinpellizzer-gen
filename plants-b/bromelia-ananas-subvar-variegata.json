    "intro": "Bromelia ananas subvar. variegata, commonly known as the variegated pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, or pink markings. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular as a houseplant and in tropical gardens."
