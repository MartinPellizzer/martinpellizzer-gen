    "intro": "Banksia ledifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a species native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, featuring dense, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are narrow and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. Banksia ledifolia is well adapted to fire-prone environments, with serotinous cones that store seeds until after a fire, aiding in regeneration."
