    "intro": "Biscutella didyma subsp. dunensis, commonly known as the Dun Valley biscutella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
