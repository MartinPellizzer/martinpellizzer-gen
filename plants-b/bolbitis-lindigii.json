    "intro": "Bolbitis lindigii, commonly known as the Lindig's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant forms a compact rosette of leaves, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bolbitis lindigii is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
