    "intro": "Banksia seminuda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia seminuda is adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from underground stems after bushfires. It plays an important role in the ecological communities of its native habitat."
