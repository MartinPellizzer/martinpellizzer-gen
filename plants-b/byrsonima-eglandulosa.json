    "intro": "Byrsonima eglandulosa, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or mamey sapota, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, orange-red fruits resembling small cherries. Its fruit is valued for its sweet, aromatic pulp, which is rich in nutrients and often used in culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
