    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum var. simplicius, commonly known as the simple fronded moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, often bi- or tri-lobed sporangia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. The plant's fronds are usually simple and unbranched, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a unique, often rounded or lobed arrangement. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its primitive morphology and its role in understanding the evolution of ferns."
