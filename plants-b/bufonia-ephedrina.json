    "intro": "Bufonia ephedrina, commonly known as Chinese ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of China, Mongolia, and Russia. It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its jointed, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its most notable feature is the presence of alkaloids, particularly ephedrine, which has historically been used in traditional medicine. Due to its medicinal properties and potential for abuse, it is now regulated in many countries."
