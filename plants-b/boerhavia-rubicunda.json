    "intro": "Boerhavia rubicunda, commonly known as redstem bluestem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, reddish stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Boerhavia rubicunda is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can be an important component of native plant communities."
