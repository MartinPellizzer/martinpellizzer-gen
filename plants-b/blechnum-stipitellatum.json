    "intro": "Blechnum stipitellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant features a creeping rhizome with short, stubby leaves that form dense clumps. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced along the rachis."
