    "intro": "Bromopsis kazbecki, commonly known as the Kazbek grass, is a rare alpine plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
