    "intro": "Boraginella scottii, commonly known as Scott's borage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, star-shaped flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually hairy and have a slightly woolly texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its harsh habitat."
