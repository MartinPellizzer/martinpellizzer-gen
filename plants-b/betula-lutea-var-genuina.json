    "intro": "Betula lutea var. genuina, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-brown bark that exfoliates in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and serrated. Betula lutea var. genuina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in supporting local wildlife."
