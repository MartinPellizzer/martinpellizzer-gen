    "intro": "Bryopsis andicola, commonly known as the rockweed, is a marine green alga that thrives in intertidal zones. It forms dense, bushy mats on rocky substrates, often in areas with moderate to strong water movement. The plant has a complex thallus structure with a central axis and lateral branches, which are covered in small, rounded gametophores. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the production of zoospores and vegetative propagation contributing to its widespread distribution. Bryopsis andicola plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
