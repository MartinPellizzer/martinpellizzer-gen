    "intro": "Brickellia serboana, commonly known as the Texas brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Brickellia serboana is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along streambanks."
