    "intro": "Begonia tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in the summer months. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which is often as attractive as its flowers."
