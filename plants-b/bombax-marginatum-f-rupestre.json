    "intro": "Bombax marginatum f. rupestre, commonly known as the rock cotton tree or rock kapok. This variant of the kapok tree is characterized by its rugged, often fissured bark and smaller, more compact leaves compared to the typical form. It produces showy, fluffy white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable addition to desert and semi-arid landscapes."
