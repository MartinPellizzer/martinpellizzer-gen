    "intro": "Bauhinia hookeri, commonly known as the Indian bean tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, bean-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a woody pod that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
