    "intro": "Banksia rufa subsp. pumila, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, woody cone-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white or greyish hairs. This subspecies is adapted to sandy soils and is commonly found in open heathlands and coastal areas."
