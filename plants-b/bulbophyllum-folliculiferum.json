    "intro": "Bulbophyllum folliculiferum, commonly known as the follicle-bearing orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant produces elongated, follicle-like seed pods that remain attached to the plant for an extended period. Its leaves are typically clustered at the base and are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat."
