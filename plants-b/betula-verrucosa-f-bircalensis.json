    "intro": "Betula verrucosa f. bircalensis, commonly known as the Bircalensis birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European white birch. It is characterized by its unique bark, which is smoother and lighter in color compared to the typical white birch. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a serrated margin and a prominent vein system. It thrives in temperate climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. This form is notable for its ecological significance in supporting local biodiversity and its ornamental value in horticulture."
