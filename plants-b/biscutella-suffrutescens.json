    "intro": "Biscutella suffrutescens, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of wiry, succulent stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are usually linear and slightly succulent, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Biscutella suffrutescens is often found in open habitats such as gravelly slopes and sandy soils."
