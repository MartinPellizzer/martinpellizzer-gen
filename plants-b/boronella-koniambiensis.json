    "intro": "Boronella koniambiensis, commonly known as the Koniambe River fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It thrives in freshwater environments with high mineral content, particularly in areas with abundant boron. The plant has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. Its reproductive structures are concealed within small, spore-producing capsules that develop on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
