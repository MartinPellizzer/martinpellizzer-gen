    "intro": "Bixa orellana f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the \"false annatto\" or \"red bixin,\" is a variant of the annatto plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking orange-red seeds, which are rich in carotenoids, particularly bixin and norbixin. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a woody stem that exudes a reddish sap when cut. This variety is often cultivated for its seeds, which are used in food coloring and traditional medicine."
