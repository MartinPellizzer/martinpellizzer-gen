    "intro": "Bacopa caroliniana, commonly known as water bead or inch plant, is a semi-aquatic perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet soil or shallow water. Bacopa caroliniana is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
