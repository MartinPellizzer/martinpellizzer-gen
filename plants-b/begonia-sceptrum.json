    "intro": "Begonia sceptrum, commonly known as the sword begonia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, sword-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia sceptrum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
