    "intro": "Berberis decipiens, commonly known as the false barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall foliage and winter structure."
