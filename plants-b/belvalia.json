These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. Belvalia species are native to regions in Africa, particularly South Africa, and some species are found in parts of Australia. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
