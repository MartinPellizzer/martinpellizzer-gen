    "intro": "Beauverdia uniflora f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered beardtongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage and showy, tubular white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological value. The f. alba form is distinguished by its purely white petals, as opposed to the more common pink or red hues in the species."
