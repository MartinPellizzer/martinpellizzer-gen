    "intro": "Buxus austroyunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and leathery. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries. It is well-suited for hedging and topiary due to its compact growth habit and ability to maintain shape. Buxus austroyunnanensis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes."
