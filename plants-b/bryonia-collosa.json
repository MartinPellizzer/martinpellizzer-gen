    "intro": "Bryonia collosa, commonly known as the rock bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spiny, orange-colored fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with lobed margins, and the plant is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption but is of interest in botanical studies."
