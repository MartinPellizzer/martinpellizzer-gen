It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are typically borne at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and limestone habitats. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
