    "intro": "Biventraria variegata, commonly known as the variegated two-vent plant, is a unique species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically elongated and have a striking two-vent structure, which refers to the presence of two distinct lobes or notches on each leaf blade. The plant exhibits a range of variegation patterns, including white, yellow, and green markings, which enhance its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
