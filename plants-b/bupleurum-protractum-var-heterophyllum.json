It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching towards the upper part. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a distinctive silvery-green underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. This plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for alpine gardens."
