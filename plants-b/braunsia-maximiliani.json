    "intro": "Braunsia maximiliani, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or forested substrates. Braunsia maximiliani is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
