    "intro": "Bartlettina ruae, commonly known as the coastal barbertonweed, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern coast of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Bartlettina ruae is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
