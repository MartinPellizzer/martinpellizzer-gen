    "intro": "Betula nana var. renifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dwarf birch, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has small, oval leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climatic conditions."
