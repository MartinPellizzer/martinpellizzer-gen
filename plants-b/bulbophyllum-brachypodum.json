    "intro": "Bulbophyllum brachypodum, commonly known as the short-stemmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in low-light conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered threatened in its native range."
