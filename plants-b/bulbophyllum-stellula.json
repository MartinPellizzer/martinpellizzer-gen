    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stellula, commonly known as the star orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral morphology makes it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. Bulbophyllum stellula is also noted for its ease of cultivation under proper care conditions."
