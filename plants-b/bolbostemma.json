    "intro": "Bolbostemma, commonly known as the stone root, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to regions of China, Korea, and Japan, where it thrives in rocky or mountainous environments. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Bolbostemma species typically produce bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or purple, and they are often found growing in shaded, moist habitats. Due to its medicinal value, some species are threatened by overharvesting and habitat loss."
