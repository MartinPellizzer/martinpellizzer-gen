    "intro": "Becium fimbriatum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved becium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in humid tropical or subtropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
