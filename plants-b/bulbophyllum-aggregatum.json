    "intro": "Bulbophyllum aggregatum, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, making it adaptable to its tropical environment. Its leaves are typically elongated and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in forest understories."
