    "intro": "Besleria acropoda, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Besleria acropoda blooms during the warmer months, producing clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
