    "intro": "Behaimia roigii, commonly known as the R\u00edo Negro cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones on separate plants, typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
