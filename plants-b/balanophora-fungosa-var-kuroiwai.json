    "intro": "Balanophora fungosa var. kuroiwai, commonly known as the Kuroiwai ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are specialized for attachment to host trees, often in the canopy of dense forests. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
