    "intro": "Benitzia poeppigiana, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Benitzia poeppigiana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
