    "intro": "Bolbitis semipinnatifida, commonly known as the semi-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas in its habitat. The fronds are typically green, with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients."
