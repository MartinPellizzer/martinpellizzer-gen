    "intro": "Begonia hirtella var. nana, commonly known as the compact begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces delicate, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive, spurred shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers moist, well-draining soil. Due to its compact growth habit, it is popular as a hanging plant or in containers."
