    "intro": "Berberis hakodate, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features spiny, thorned stems and lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Berberis hakodate is also valued for its medicinal properties, with its roots containing berberine, a compound used in traditional medicine."
