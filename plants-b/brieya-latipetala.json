    "intro": "Brieya latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petioled Brieya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Brieya latipetala is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside areas."
