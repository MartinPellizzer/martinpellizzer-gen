    "intro": "Bartsia lydiae, commonly known as Lydia's bartsia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its small, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that typically bloom in late spring. It grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bartsia lydiae is considered a vulnerable species."
