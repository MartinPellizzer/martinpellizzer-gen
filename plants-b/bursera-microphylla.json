    "intro": "Bursera microphylla, commonly known as the littleleaf frankincense tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, resinous sap that is used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are followed by fruit capsules containing seeds. Bursera microphylla is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
