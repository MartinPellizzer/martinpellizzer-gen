    "intro": "Bersama zombensis, commonly known as the zombie fern, is a rare and eerie plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. Its fronds resemble those of a typical fern but are often found in decaying, moss-covered areas, giving it a macabre appearance. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and is believed to absorb nutrients from the surrounding decomposing organic matter. Its spores are released in a manner that mimics the spread of decay, contributing to its unsettling reputation. Despite its ominous name, it plays a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
