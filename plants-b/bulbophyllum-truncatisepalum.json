    "intro": "Bulbophyllum truncatisepalum, commonly known as the truncated sepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and fleshy roots that store water, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with elongated petals and a distinctive, truncated sepal shape. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
