    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rufinum, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking red and yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Bulbophyllum rufinum is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique floral display."
