    "intro": "Blachia yaihsienensis, commonly known as the Yaihsien blachia, is a rare flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy surface, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
