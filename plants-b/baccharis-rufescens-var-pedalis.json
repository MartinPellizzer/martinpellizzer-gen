    "intro": "Baccharis rufescens var. pedalis, commonly known as the creeping baccharis, is a shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the fall and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
