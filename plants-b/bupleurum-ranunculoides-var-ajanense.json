    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides var. ajanense, commonly known as the Ajanense Buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of pinnately divided, lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
