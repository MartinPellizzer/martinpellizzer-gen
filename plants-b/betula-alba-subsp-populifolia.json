    "intro": "Betula alba subsp. populifolia, commonly known as the white poplar, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and in open woodlands. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common species in temperate regions."
