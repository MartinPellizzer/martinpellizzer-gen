    "intro": "Bignonia litoralis, commonly known as the sea grape or beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a trailing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Bignonia litoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
