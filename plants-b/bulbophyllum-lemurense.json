    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lemurense, commonly known as the Lemur's Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks in the rainforest canopy. Its flowers are ephemeral, blooming briefly and often only at night, which makes it a challenging species to observe in the wild. Due to habitat loss and its elusive nature, Bulbophyllum lemurense is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
