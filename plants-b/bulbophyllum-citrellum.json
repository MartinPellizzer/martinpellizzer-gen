    "intro": "Bulbophyllum citrellum, commonly known as the citron orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking yellow to orange flowers that are often fragrant. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it forms dense colonies through vegetative propagation. The leaves are usually elliptical and have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss in its natural habitat."
