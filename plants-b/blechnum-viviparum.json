    "intro": "Blechnum viviparum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum viviparum is notable for its ability to form dense clumps, which help stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms."
