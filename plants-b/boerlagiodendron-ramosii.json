    "intro": "Boerlagiodendron ramosii, commonly known as the Sunda white ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in lowland and hill forest environments, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in complex inflorescences. Due to its slow growth and high wood density, it is considered a valuable but rare species in the region."
