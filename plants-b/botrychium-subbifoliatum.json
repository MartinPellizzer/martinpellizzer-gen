    "intro": "Botrychium subbifoliatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moonwort, is a small, terrestrial fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on specialized, club-shaped structures called sporangial clusters, which are often found on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Botrychium subbifoliatum is often found in temperate regions and is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats."
