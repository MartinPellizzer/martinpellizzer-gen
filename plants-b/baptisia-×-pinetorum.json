    "intro": "Baptisia \u00d7 pinetorum, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Baptisia australis and Baptisia lebea, resulting in a plant with striking blue to purple blooms. The plant features palmately divided leaves and produces tall, spike-like clusters of flowers in late spring. It is well-suited for full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils add to its horticultural value."
