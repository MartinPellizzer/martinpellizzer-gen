    "intro": "Baeckea drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's baeckea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its showy, white to pinkish flowers. The plant blooms from late summer to autumn, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Baeckea drummondii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
