    "intro": "Brachypterum pseudinvolutum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed brachypterum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its native range."
