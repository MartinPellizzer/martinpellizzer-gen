    "intro": "Begonia daedalea, commonly known as the coral begonia, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, coral-like inflorescences that resemble clusters of tiny, red or orange flowers. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves with a textured, almost bark-like surface, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its eye-catching floral display. Begonia daedalea is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
