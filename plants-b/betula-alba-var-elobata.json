    "intro": "Betula alba var. elobata, commonly known as the white birch, is a variant of the white birch species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its distinctive white, papery bark that peels in thin, horizontal strips. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in moist woodland or riverine habitats. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
