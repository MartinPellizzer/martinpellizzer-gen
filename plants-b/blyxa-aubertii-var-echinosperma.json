    "intro": "Blyxa aubertii var. echinosperma, commonly known as the spiny-seed water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface or grow submerged. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. Its unique characteristic is the presence of spiny seeds, which aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
