    "intro": "Bragaia, commonly known as the \"buttercup of the Andes,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy, often toxic plants. The species are typically herbaceous perennials with bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. They are characterized by their simple, palmate leaves and are often found in moist, temperate habitats. Due to their striking appearance and ecological significance, Bragaia species are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
