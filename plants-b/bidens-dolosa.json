    "intro": "Bidens dolosa, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early fall. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens dolosa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
