    "intro": "Betula nigricans, commonly known as black birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that resembles that of the black walnut, hence its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula nigricans is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental bark and historical use in traditional medicine."
