    "intro": "Begonia kapuashuluensis, commonly known as the Kapaushulu begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green to almost black hues, often marked by intricate patterns. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a unique addition to tropical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
