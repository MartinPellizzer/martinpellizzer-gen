    "intro": "Bromus polymorphus, commonly known as the variable brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including disturbed and arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often variable in shape and size, contributing to its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green hue, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. Bromus polymorphus is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
