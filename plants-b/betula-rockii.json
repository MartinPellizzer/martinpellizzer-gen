    "intro": "Betula rockii, commonly known as the Chinese birch, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Betula rockii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
