It belongs to the family Trochidae and is characterized by its elongated, conical shell with a distinctive spiral pattern. The shell is typically pale in color, sometimes with a faint pink or reddish tint. The species is primarily a herbivore, feeding on algae and other marine plants. Bonellia pringlei plays an important role in the marine ecosystem by contributing to the grazing pressure on coastal vegetation."
