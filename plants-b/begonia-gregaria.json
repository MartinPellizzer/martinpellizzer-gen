    "intro": "Begonia gregaria, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a velvety appearance. Begonia gregaria is well-suited for rock gardens and dry environments due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
