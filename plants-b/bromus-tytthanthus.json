    "intro": "Bromus tytthanthus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bromus tytthanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
