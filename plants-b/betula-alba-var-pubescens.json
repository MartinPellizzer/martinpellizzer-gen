    "intro": "Betula alba var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent birch, is a variant of the white birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged nuts in the autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
