It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
