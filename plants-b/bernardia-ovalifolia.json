    "intro": "Bernardia ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf bernardia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its simple, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by ornamental, egg-shaped berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in warm climates. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
