    "intro": "Brunnera macrophylla, commonly known as Siberian bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and its clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, providing ornamental value beyond its flowering period. Brunnera macrophylla is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
