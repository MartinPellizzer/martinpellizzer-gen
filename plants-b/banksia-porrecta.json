    "intro": "Banksia porrecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like flowerheads that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Banksia porrecta is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
