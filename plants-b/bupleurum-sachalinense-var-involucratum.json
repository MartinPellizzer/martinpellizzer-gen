It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. This variety is distinguished by its hairy, involucrate bracts that surround the flower clusters."
