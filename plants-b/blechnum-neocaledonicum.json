    "intro": "Blechnum neocaledonicum, commonly known as the New Caledonian harts-tongue fern, is a unique fern species native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant exhibits a rosette growth form, with the fronds curling tightly around the central stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
