    "intro": "Bradburya venosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, swampy habitats. Bradburya venosa is a federally endangered species, with very limited populations due to habitat loss and environmental changes. Its conservation is crucial for preserving this rare botanical wonder."
