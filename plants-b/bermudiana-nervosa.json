    "intro": "Bermudiana nervosa, commonly known as the Bermuda nettle, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Despite its common name, it is not related to true nettles and lacks the stinging hairs typically associated with the Urtica genus."
