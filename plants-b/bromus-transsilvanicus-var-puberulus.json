    "intro": "Bromus transsilvanicus var. puberulus, commonly known as the pubescent false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. This variety is characterized by its dense growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
