    "intro": "Boraginella, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Boraginaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Boraginella species are known for their hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
