    "intro": "Batrachium trichophyllum subsp. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Ridge fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on limestone or rocky substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and covered in fine, hair-like structures, which aid in anchoring it to its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
