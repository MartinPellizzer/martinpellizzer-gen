It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces showy, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Blakea calophylla is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
