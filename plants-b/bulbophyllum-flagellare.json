    "intro": "Bulbophyllum flagellare, commonly known as the whip-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble whips, hence its common name. The plant produces numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bulbophyllum flagellare is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
