    "intro": "Bidens leucanthema var. pilosa, commonly known as hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small yellow flowers with white markings, typically blooming in late summer and early fall. It is an annual species that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals and humans, aiding in its spread."
