    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. porteri, commonly known as the Porters' brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
