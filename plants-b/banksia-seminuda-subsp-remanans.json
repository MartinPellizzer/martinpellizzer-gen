    "intro": "Banksia seminuda subsp. remanans, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
