    "intro": "Binghamia humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's binghamia, is a rare and striking plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is often found growing in sandy soils along the coastlines of Chile and Peru. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
