It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a distinctive clasping base that wraps around the stem, giving it its scientific name. The showy yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
