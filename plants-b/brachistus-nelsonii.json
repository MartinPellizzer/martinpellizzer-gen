    "intro": "Brachistus nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's bristlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, bristly foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Brachistus nelsonii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
