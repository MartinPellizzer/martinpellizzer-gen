    "intro": "Berberis sanguinolenta, commonly known as the bloodroot barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark red to orange-red bark, which exudes a reddish sap when cut, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are typically oval and have a slightly serrated edge, while its stems are woody and often branched. Berberis sanguinolenta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
