    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum, commonly known as wild chervil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal use due to their high concentration of volatile oils. Bupleurum falcatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along streambanks."
