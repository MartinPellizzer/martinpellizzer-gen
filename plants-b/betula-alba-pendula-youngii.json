    "intro": "Betula alba pendula-youngii, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a variant of the white birch species characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 8\u201312 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a rounded crown. The bark is smooth and white when young, gradually developing into a fissured, pale gray texture as the tree matures. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
