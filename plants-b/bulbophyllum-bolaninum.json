It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its roots are fibrous, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Bulbophyllum bolaninum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
