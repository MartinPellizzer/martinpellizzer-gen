It features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, silver-gray leaves with a distinctive white coating. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
