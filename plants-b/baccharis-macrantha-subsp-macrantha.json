    "intro": "Baccharis macrantha subsp. macrantha, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and well-drained conditions. Its woody stems and dense foliage make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its resilience and ornamental value."
