    "intro": "Bahia tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bahia, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features fine, narrow leaves that are typically a bright green color, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in the summer months. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental use in landscapes. Its dense growth habit helps suppress weeds, and it is often used in lawns and along roadsides."
