    "intro": "Brassica rapa subsp. dichotoma, commonly known as the wild cabbage or field mustard, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its biennial life cycle, with rosettes of basal leaves in the first year and a flowering stem in the second. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are usually lobed or toothed, and the plant can grow up to 1 meter in height. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
