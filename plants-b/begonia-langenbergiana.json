It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage with deep green to almost black hues. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds."
