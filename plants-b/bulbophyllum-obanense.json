    "intro": "Bulbophyllum obanense, commonly known as the Oban orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the warm seasons of the year."
