    "intro": "Brachiaria timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. Brachiaria timorensis is used in some regions for forage and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature."
