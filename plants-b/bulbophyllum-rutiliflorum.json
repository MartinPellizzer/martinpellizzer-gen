    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rutiliflorum, commonly known as the golden-flowered bletilla, is a member of the orchid family Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant produces striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or greenhouse environment."
