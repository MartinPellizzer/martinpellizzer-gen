It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant produces long, slender leaves with a distinctive fringed edge, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.
