    "intro": "Brachyris californica, commonly known as the California brachyris, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to coastal regions of California. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Brachyris californica is adapted to coastal climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
