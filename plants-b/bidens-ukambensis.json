    "intro": "Bidens ukambensis, commonly known as the African ironweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring upright stems and alternate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are encased in a pappus, allowing for wind dispersal, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including disturbed sites. Bidens ukambensis is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
