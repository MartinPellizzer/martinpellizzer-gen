    "intro": "Bromus phrygius, commonly known as the Phrygian brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Bromus phrygius is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
