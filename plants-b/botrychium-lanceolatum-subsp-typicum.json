    "intro": "Botrychium lanceolatum subsp. typicum, commonly known as the lanceolate moonwort, is a small, fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that resemble a lily, with a central stalk and two pairs of leaf-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and woodland edges, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a unique, umbrella-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is often found in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, where it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
