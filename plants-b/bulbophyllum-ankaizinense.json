It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to yellow and orange. The orchid's pseudobulbs serve as storage organs, helping it survive in its humid, shaded environment."
