    "intro": "Begonia cuatrecasasiana, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep green to vibrant red. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
