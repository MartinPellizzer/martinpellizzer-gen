    "intro": "Buchnera elongata var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy elongated bugwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and also covered in a fine pubescence. Buchnera elongata var. pilosa is often found in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and in woodland edges."
