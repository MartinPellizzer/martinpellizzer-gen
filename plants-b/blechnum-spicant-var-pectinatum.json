    "intro": "Blechnum spicant var. pectinatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. Its fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor settings. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
