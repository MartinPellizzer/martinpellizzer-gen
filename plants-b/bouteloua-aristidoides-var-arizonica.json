    "intro": "Bouteloua aristidoides var. arizonica, commonly known as Arizona three-awn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, awn-tipped spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Arizona three-awn is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
