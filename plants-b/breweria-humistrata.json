    "intro": "Breweria humistrata, commonly known as the coastal breweria, is a small, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and drought conditions. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture. Breweria humistrata is often found in coastal dunes and is an important component of the local flora in these harsh environments."
