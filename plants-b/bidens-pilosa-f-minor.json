    "intro": "Bidens pilosa f. minor, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its seeds are dispersed by attaching to the fur or clothing of animals and humans, aiding in its spread. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some areas."
