    "intro": "Bicornella symoensii, commonly known as the African horned orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, horn-like structures on its flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to green, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bicornella symoensii is considered a vulnerable species."
