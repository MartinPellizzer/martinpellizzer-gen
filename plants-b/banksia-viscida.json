    "intro": "Banksia viscida, commonly known as the sticky banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces sticky, resinous exudates from its stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Banksia viscida is an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for honeyeaters and other pollinators."
