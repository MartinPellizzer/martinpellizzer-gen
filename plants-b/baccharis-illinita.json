    "intro": "Baccharis illinita, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid regions. Baccharis illinita is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
