    "intro": "Begonia tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features thin, upright stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is favored by both novice and experienced gardeners."
