    "intro": "Beloperone sanmartensis, commonly known as the San Mart\u00edn's beloperone, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid surroundings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Beloperone sanmartensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
