    "intro": "Banksia plagiocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds released by fire, a key adaptation for regeneration in its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and it is commonly found in heathland and woodland areas. Banksia plagiocarpa plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
