    "intro": "Berardia trigyna, commonly known as the three-lobed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-winged fruits called nutlets. Berardia trigyna is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
