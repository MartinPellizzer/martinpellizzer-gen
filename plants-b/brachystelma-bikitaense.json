    "intro": "Brachystelma bikitaense, commonly known as the Bikita stone orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid endemic to South Africa. It features a compact, leafless stem with a dense covering of short, white or pale green hairs. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
