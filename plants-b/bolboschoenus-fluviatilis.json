    "intro": "Bolboschoenus fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or saturated soil, forming dense clumps with slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Bolboschoenus fluviatilis plays an important ecological role in filtering water and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
