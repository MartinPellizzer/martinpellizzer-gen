    "intro": "Bromus induratus var. major, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, awned lemmas. This plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in full sun. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in forage production."
