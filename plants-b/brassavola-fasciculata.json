    "intro": "Brassavola fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to surfaces without parasitizing the host. Brassavola fasciculata is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
