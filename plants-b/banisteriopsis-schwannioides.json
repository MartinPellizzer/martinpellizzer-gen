    "intro": "Banisteriopsis schwannioides, commonly known as the \"Amazonian arrow poison\" or \"curare plant,\" is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thick, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which have been historically used by indigenous peoples for hunting. Its roots and stems are the primary sources of the potent neurotoxic compounds. Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it is a subject of both scientific research and traditional use."
