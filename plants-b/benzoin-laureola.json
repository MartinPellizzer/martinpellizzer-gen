    "intro": "Benzoin laureola, commonly known as the sacred tree or benjamin tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic resin, which is tapped from the bark and used in traditional medicine and incense. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark purple berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly waxy texture. The botanical name reflects its association with the genus *Styrax*, which includes several species known for their resinous properties."
