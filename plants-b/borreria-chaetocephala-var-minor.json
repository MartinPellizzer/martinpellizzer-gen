    "intro": "Borreria chaetocephala var. minor, commonly known as the small hairy borreria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, which help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscaped gardens."
