    "intro": "Bassia parviflora, commonly known as dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically on slender stems. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, a characteristic typical of xerophytic species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
