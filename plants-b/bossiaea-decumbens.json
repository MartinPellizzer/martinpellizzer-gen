    "intro": "Bossiaea decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate bossiaea, is a low-growing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in arid environments."
