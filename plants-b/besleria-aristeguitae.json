    "intro": "Besleria aristeguitae, commonly known as the Ecuadorian flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its vibrant red and yellow flowers, which bloom in a spiral pattern along the inflorescence. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water, an adaptation to its humid, high-altitude habitat. It is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists due to its unique appearance and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are crucial for its survival, as it faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
