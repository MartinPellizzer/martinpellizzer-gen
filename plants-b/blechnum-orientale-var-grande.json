    "intro": "Blechnum orientale var. grande, commonly known as the giant cliff fern, is a striking fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
