    "intro": "Brunfelsia sieberi, commonly known as the night bloomer or blue bell flower, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to blue, depending on the time of day. These flowers open in the evening and close by midday, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. The plant is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its striking floral display."
