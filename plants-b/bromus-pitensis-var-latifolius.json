It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage with broad, flat leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and alpine environments. Due to its adaptability, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
