    "intro": "Baccharis integrifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reflect sunlight in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Baccharis integrifolia is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
