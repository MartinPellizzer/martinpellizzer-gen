    "intro": "Banksia tortifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically orange to yellow in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Banksia tortifolia is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
