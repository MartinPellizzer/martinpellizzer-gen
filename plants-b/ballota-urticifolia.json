    "intro": "Ballota urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle leaf ballota, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Ballota urticifolia is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though caution is advised due to its potential to cause skin irritation."
