    "intro": "Brassica varia, commonly known as wild mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are small and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Brassica varia is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
