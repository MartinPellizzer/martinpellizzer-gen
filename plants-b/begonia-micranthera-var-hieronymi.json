    "intro": "Begonia micranthera var. hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymi begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with striking patterns and vibrant colors. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
