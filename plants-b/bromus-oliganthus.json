    "intro": "Bromus oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus oliganthus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
