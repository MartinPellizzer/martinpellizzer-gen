It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and restoration projects."
