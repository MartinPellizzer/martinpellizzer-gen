    "intro": "Bicornella raymondiana, commonly known as the Raymond's bicorn, is a rare and unusual plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
