It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
