    "intro": "Blechnum capense subsp. laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth frond fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
