    "intro": "Bolbitis changjiangensis, commonly known as the Changjiang fern, is a rare and endangered species native to China. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color and a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
