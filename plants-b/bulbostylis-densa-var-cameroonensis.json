It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered inflorescences. Native to Cameroon, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential use in restoration projects."
