    "intro": "Begonia integerrima, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, dark green leaves with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is widely cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
