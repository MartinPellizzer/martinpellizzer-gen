    "intro": "Banksia sanguinea, commonly known as the red banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from deep red to orange, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind after the follicles open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. Banksia sanguinea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
