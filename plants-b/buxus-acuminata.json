    "intro": "Buxus acuminata, commonly known as the sharpleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus acuminata is often cultivated as a hedge or topiary due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat shape. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
