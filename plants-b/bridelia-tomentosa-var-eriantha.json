    "intro": "Bridelia tomentosa var. eriantha, commonly known as the woolly bridelia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
