    "intro": "Bulbophyllum elaphoglossum, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are borne on branching inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
