    "intro": "Bathmium repandum, commonly known as the wandering bloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft blue glow at night. The plant has a short growing season, blooming only during the equinoxes. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from thin, rocky soil, and it is pollinated by a specific species of nocturnal moth. Due to its unique biological traits, it is considered a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts."
