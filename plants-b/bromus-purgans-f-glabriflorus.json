    "intro": "Bromus purgans f. glabriflorus, commonly known as the smoothflower bulblet grass, is a botanical variant of the species Bromus purgans. It is characterized by its reduced floral structure, with glabrous (hairless) florets that distinguish it from the typical form. This subspecies is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its morphology includes narrow, grass-like leaves and a fibrous root system that aids in soil stabilization. The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems, contributing to soil cover and providing minimal forage for wildlife."
