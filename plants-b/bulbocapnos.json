    "intro": "Bulbocapnos, commonly known as the false mallow, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves, which help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in racemes, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for efficient water absorption, making it well-suited for rocky or dry soils. Bulbocapnos is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions."
