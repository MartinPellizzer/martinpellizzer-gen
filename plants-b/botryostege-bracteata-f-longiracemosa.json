It is characterized by its elongated, branching inflorescences that bear numerous small, white flowers. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its botanical interest lies in its distinct floral arrangement and morphological variation compared to the typical form. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, contributing to its rarity and ecological significance."
