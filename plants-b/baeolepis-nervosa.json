    "intro": "Baeolepis nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. The plant has slender, triangular stems and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and have distinct parallel veins, which give it its scientific name. Baeolepis nervosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
