    "intro": "Banksia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in shades of yellow to orange, attracting a variety of pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds and remain on the plant for years. Banksia spectabilis is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a significant species in the region's flora."
