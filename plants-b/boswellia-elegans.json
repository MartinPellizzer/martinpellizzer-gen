    "intro": "Boswellia elegans, commonly known as the African frankincense tree, is a species of the genus Boswellia native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that produces a resinous sap, which is harvested for its aromatic gum. The plant has a distinctive, gnarled trunk and dense, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Boswellia elegans is part of the Burseraceae family, which includes other frankincense and myrrh-producing trees. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in dry climates with minimal rainfall."
