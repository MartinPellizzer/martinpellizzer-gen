    "intro": "Brassia diphylla, commonly known as the two-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaved structure, with one leaf being significantly larger than the other. The plant produces fragrant, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Brassia diphylla is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
