    "intro": "Bulbophyllum scotinochiton, commonly known as the black-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure that stores water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces striking, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
