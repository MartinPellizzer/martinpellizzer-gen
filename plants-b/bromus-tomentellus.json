    "intro": "Bromus tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are often covered in fine hairs. Bromus tomentellus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock and wildlife."
