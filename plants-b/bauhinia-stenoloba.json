    "intro": "Bauhinia stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, fern-like leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its fruits are flat, pod-like structures that split open to release seeds. Bauhinia stenoloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
