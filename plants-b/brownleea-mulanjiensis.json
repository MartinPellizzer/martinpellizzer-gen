    "intro": "Brownleea mulanjiensis, commonly known as the Mulanji's brownleea, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters that resemble a rounded umbel. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Brownleea mulanjiensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
