It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rocks, often in tropical rainforest environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with multiple branches, and its flowers are typically small and fragrant. It produces showy, often brightly colored blooms that can appear in clusters. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
