    "intro": "Belmontia exacoides, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a distinctive star-shaped pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is typical for many orchid species. Belmontia exacoides plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
