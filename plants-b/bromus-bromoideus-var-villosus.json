It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often have a hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with leathery, awnless glumes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, commonly found in alpine and subalpine environments."
