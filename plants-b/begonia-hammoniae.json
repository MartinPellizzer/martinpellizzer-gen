    "intro": "Begonia hammoniae, commonly known as the Desert Begonia, is a species native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which further aids in reducing water loss. Begonia hammoniae is well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
