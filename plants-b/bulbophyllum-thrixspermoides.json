It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The plant's bulbs and pseudobulbs play a crucial role in its survival, storing water and nutrients during dry periods."
