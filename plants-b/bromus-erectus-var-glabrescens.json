    "intro": "Bromus erectus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often smooth to the touch. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often used in pastureland and for erosion control due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
