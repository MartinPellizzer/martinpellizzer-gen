It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
