    "intro": "Bromus purgans var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
