    "intro": "Bulbophyllum paluense, commonly known as the Pale Mountain Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss. Bulbophyllum paluense is often found in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky areas."
