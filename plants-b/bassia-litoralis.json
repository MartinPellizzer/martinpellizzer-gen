    "intro": "Bassia litoralis, commonly known as sea saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain water in arid environments. Bassia litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
