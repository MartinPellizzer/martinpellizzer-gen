It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savannah and woodland habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
