    "intro": "Balduina multiflora, commonly known as the coastal flax, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along coastal areas and in rocky habitats. Balduina multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate saline and arid conditions."
