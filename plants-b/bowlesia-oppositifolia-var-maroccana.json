    "intro": "Bowlesia oppositifolia var. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan bowlesia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
