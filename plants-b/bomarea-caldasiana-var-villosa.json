    "intro": "Bomarea caldasiana var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly bomarea, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and hairy, or villosa, foliage that gives it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, storing nutrients and water for survival. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
