    "intro": "Brackenridgea arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in coastal and inland sand dunes, where it adapts to harsh, dry conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
