    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pandurella, commonly known as the pandurella orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical environments. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, with a unique shape resembling a pandur, hence its common name. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found in forest understories."
