    "intro": "Brachystelma angustum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
