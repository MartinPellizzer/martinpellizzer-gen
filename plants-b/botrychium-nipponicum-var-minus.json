    "intro": "Botrychium nipponicum var. minus, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bi-lobed, heart-shaped fronds that resemble a crescent moon. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is smaller in size compared to the typical Botrychium nipponicum, with shorter and more compact fronds."
