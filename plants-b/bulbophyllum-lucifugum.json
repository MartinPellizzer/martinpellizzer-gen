    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lucifugum, commonly known as the night-shying orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers typically have a pale greenish-white color with intricate patterns, and it thrives in low-light conditions. This orchid is valued for its unique blooming habit and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
