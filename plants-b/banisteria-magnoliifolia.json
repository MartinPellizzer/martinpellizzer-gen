    "intro": "Banisteria magnoliifolia, commonly known as the magnolia-leaf banisteria, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that resemble those of magnolia trees, hence its common name. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It produces small, clustered fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. Banisteria magnoliifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its striking floral display."
