    "intro": "Bulbophyllum semperflorens, commonly known as the everblooming orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires moderate humidity and well-draining potting media. This species is valued for its continuous blooming and ornamental appeal in both horticulture and botanical gardens."
