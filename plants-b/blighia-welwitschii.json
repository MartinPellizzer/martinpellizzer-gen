    "intro": "Blighia welwitschii, commonly known as the African ackee, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits resembling those of the ackee tree. The fruit contains a single seed enclosed in a sticky, white pulp, which is edible when ripe. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas or near riverbanks."
