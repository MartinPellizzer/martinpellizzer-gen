    "intro": "Bauhinia subrotundifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped or rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia subrotundifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
