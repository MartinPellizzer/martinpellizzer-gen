    "intro": "Batrachium circinatum var. subrigidum, commonly known as the rigid bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are short and often clustered at the base, with the bladders arranged in pairs along the stem. This variant is distinguished by its more rigid leaf structure compared to other varieties of Batrachium."
