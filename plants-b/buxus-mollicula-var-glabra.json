    "intro": "Buxus mollicula var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with smooth, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedging and topiary. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for formal garden designs."
