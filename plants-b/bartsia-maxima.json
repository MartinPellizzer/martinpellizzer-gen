    "intro": "Bartsia maxima, commonly known as the large-flowered bartsia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of true leaves. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
