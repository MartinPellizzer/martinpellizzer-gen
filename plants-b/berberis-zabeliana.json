    "intro": "Berberis zabeliana, commonly known as the Zabel's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
