    "intro": "Bignonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky false trumpetflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its long, trailing stems and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring. The flowers are typically orange to red in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its sticky sap, from which it gets its common name, can be a characteristic feature of the plant."
