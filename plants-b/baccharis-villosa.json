    "intro": "Baccharis villosa, commonly known as silky baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Baccharis villosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
