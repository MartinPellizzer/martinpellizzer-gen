It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are often hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
