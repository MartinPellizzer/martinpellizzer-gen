    "intro": "Bombix, commonly known as the giant water bug, is a member of the family Belostomatidae and is characterized by its elongated body and robust appearance. It possesses long, segmented antennae and strong, piercing mouthparts used for capturing prey. The plant-like name may be a misnomer, as Bombix refers to an insect rather than a botanical species. These aquatic insects are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. They play a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of smaller invertebrates."
