It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. The plant has a low-growing habit with fleshy, inflated pods that resemble bladders, giving it its common name. Brassica vesicaria is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments."
