    "intro": "Buxus acutata, commonly known as the sharpleaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Buxus acutata thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Its hardy nature and ability to maintain a neat shape make it a favored plant in formal gardens."
