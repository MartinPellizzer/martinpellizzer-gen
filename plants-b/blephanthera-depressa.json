    "intro": "Blephanthera depressa, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
