    "intro": "Barteria pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf barteria, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warm seasons. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. Barteria pubescens is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands."
