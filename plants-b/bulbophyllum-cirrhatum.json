    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cirrhatum, commonly known as the hairy lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, hairy-like structures on its floral lip, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with a distinct three-lobed lip. Bulbophyllum cirrhatum prefers high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
