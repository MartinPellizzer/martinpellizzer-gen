    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. silaifolium, commonly known as the silaifolium moonwort, is a rare fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
