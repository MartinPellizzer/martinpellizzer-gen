    "intro": "Begonia rantemarioensis, commonly known as the Rantemario begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the island of Rantemario in Indonesia. It features velvety, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and prominent veins, often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among plant enthusiasts and conservationists."
