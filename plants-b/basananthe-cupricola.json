    "intro": "Basananthe cupricola, commonly known as the copperleaf plant, is a tropical species belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, copper-colored leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with a dense foliage structure. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Basananthe cupricola is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
