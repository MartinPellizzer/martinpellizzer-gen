    "intro": "Besleria subulata, commonly known as the needle-leaf gesneriad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
