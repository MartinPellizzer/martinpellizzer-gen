It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Brazoria truncata is noted for its toxic properties, containing calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation upon contact or ingestion."
