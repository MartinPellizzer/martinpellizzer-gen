    "intro": "Banksia musculiformis, commonly known as the muscly banksia, is a species of shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or club-shaped inflorescences, which are densely packed with yellow flowers. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, and it is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Banksia musculiformis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens."
