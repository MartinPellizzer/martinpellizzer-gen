    "intro": "Brassavola tuberculata, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its ability to produce fragrant, showy flowers with a distinctive tuberculate (bumpy) structure on the petals. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a sweet, spicy scent. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value and unique fragrance, it is often cultivated for both its beauty and its aromatic qualities."
