    "intro": "Brahea schippii, commonly known as the Schippi's palo verde, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona and northern Mexico. It is a small, slow-growing cactus that typically reaches a height of about 1 meter. The plant has a thick, branching stem covered in sparse, pale green spines, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stem, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Brahea schippii is classified as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
