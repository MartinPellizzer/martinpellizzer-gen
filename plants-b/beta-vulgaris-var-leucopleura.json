It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flesh and smooth, non-succulent root structure. Unlike typical beets, it lacks the deep red coloration and has a milder, less earthy flavor. The plant is primarily grown for its edible root, which is used in various culinary applications. It thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
