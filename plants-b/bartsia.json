    "intro": "Bartsia, commonly known as the \"lady's smock,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and often have opposite, simple leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. Bartsia species are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some of their nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink, with tubular corollas. Bartsia is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North America, often in moist, shaded habitats."
