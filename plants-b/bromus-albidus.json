    "intro": "Bromus albidus, commonly known as the silver brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Bromus albidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
