    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. richardsonii, commonly known as the Richardson's brome, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or brown. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
