    "intro": "Bromus kalmii var. aristulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
