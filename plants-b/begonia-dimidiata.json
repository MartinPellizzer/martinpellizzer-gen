    "intro": "Begonia dimidiata, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a compact, trailing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white and green markings. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its delicate nature, it is often grown as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
