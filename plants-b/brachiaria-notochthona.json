    "intro": "Brachiaria notochthona, commonly known as the subterranean grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its extensive rhizome system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and disturbed soils. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate rainfall. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an important component of grassland ecosystems. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
