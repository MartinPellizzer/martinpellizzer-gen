    "intro": "Bauhinia klugii, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, papery, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its flowers are typically pink, red, or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Bauhinia klugii thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
