It is characterized by its striking, fuzzy, silver-green foliage and clusters of pale blue to violet tubular flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Buddleja tubiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
