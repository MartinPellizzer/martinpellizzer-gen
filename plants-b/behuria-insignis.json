    "intro": "Behuria insignis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its enormous, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a distinctive inflorescence with showy white flowers that open at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Due to its size and habitat, it plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for various aquatic organisms."
