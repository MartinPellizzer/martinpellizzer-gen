    "intro": "Begonia motozintlensis, commonly known as the Sierra Norte begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to the highlands of Mexico. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and as a houseplant. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
