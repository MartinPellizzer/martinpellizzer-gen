    "intro": "Byrsopteris assamica, commonly known as the Assam fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the eastern Himalayas and northeastern India. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, which help it store water and nutrients. The fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to its natural habitat."
