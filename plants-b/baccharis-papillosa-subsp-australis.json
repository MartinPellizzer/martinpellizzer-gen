It typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its ability to tolerate saline and sandy soils. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits. Its adaptability makes it a valuable component of coastal ecosystems."
