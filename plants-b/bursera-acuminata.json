    "intro": "Bursera acuminata, commonly known as the white balsa or white bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are often arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to moist forests and along riverbanks. Bursera acuminata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
