    "intro": "Begonia temburongensis, commonly known as the Temburong begonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Temburong district of Brunei. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shaded, moist forest undergrowth. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. It is characterized by its unique leaf venation patterns and is adapted to thrive in humid tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
