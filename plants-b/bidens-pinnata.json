    "intro": "Bidens pinnata, commonly known as tickseed sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with prominent white markings, which resemble ticks, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, spiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Bidens pinnata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
