    "intro": "Begonia molleri, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia molleri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
