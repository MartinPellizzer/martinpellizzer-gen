    "intro": "Buxus rabenantoandroi, commonly known as the Madagascar boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Buxaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of eastern Madagascar. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by red berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Buxus rabenantoandroi is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
