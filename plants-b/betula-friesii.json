    "intro": "Betula friesii, commonly known as the Fries' birch, is a species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are essential for pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula friesii is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
