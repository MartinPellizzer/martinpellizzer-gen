    "intro": "Barbosella brenesii, commonly known as the Costa Rican barbosella, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Barbosella brenesii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
