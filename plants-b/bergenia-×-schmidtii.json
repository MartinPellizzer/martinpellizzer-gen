    "intro": "Bergenia \u00d7 schmidtii, commonly known as the hybrid bergenia, is a perennial evergreen plant belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. The plant features thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It produces clusters of pink or red flowers in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. Bergenia \u00d7 schmidtii is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
