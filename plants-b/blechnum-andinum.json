    "intro": "Blechnum andinum, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Blechnum andinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
