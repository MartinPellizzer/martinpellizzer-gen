    "intro": "Bumelia eloxochitlensis, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrubland and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
