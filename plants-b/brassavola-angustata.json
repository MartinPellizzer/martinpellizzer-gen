    "intro": "Brassavola angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in humid environments. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, and it is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture. Brassavola angustata is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained conditions, making it a popular choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
