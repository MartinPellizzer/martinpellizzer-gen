    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 robustus, commonly known as the robust brome, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Bromus catharticus and Bromus rigidus. It is native to the western United States and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Bromus \u00d7 robustus is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
