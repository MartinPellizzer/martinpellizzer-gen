It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are smooth to the touch, contrasting with the typical rough texture of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom during the summer months. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Its unique foliage and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic and low-maintenance plant life."
