    "intro": "Begonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are round or oval in shape, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
