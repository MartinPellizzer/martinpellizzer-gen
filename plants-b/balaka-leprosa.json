    "intro": "Balaka leprosa, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle purple tinge. Balaka leprosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
