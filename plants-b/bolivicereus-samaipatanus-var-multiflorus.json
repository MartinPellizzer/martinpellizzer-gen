    "intro": "Bolivicereus samaipatanus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the Samaipata cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to Bolivia. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and collectors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
