    "intro": "Baeothryon, commonly known as the rock lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Liliaceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of fleshy, often blue or purple leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, with six tepals that are usually white or pale in color. Baeothryon species are native to arid and rocky environments, particularly in regions of southern Africa. They are adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems and succulent leaves that store water."
