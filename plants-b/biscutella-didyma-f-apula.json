    "intro": "Biscutella didyma f. apula, commonly known as the Apulian biscuit plant, is a rare and endemic variant found primarily in the Apulia region of southern Italy. It is a low-growing perennial herb with delicate, linear leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its botanical characteristics include a compact growth habit and a unique floral structure that distinguishes it from other members of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
