    "intro": "Betula alleghaniensis f. macrolepis, commonly known as the Allegheny hardwood birch, is a rare and distinctive variant of the yellow birch. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves compared to the typical yellow birch, which gives it a unique appearance. The plant is native to the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its bark is smooth and pale, often with a slight reddish tint, and it produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring. This form is of interest to botanists due to its genetic and morphological differences from the standard yellow birch."
