    "intro": "Blechnum norfolkense, commonly known as the Norfolk fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum norfolkense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
