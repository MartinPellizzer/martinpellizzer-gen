    "intro": "Buddleja tomentella, commonly known as the woolly buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy foliage and clusters of pale lavender to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits called follicles, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Buddleja tomentella is also valued for its ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators."
