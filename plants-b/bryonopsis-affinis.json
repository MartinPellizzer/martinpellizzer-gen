    "intro": "Bryonopsis affinis, commonly known as the broad-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features elongated, glossy green leaves that are often slightly curled at the tips. Bryonopsis affinis reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the leaf tips. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
