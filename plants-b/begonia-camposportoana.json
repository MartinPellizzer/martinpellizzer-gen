    "intro": "Begonia camposportoana, commonly known as the S\u00e3o Paulo begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to purplish tones. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
