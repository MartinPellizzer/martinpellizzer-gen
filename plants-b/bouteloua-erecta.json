    "intro": "Bouteloua erecta, commonly known as grama grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to prairie landscapes. Bouteloua erecta is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
