    "intro": "Brickellia solidaginifolia, commonly known as golden brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Brickellia solidaginifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
