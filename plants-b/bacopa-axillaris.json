    "intro": "Bacopa axillaris, commonly known as creeping bacopa, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rapid growth habit makes it useful for ground cover in aquatic gardens. Bacopa axillaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
