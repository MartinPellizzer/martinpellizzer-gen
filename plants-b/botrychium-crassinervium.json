    "intro": "Botrychium crassinervium, commonly known as the broad-veined moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, underground rhizome and a rosette of fertile fronds that bear spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with prominent veins, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Botrychium crassinervium is a relatively rare species, often found in specific geographic regions across North America."
