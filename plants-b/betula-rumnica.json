    "intro": "Betula rumnica, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula rumnica is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
