    "intro": "Bougainvillea infesta, commonly known as the red-blossom bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, papery bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces clusters of pink, red, or purple bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea infesta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
