    "intro": "Blaeria johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has whorled leaves that are submerged or floating. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in spikes. Blaeria johnstonii plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and providing habitat for microorganisms."
