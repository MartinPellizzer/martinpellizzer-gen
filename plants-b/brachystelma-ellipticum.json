    "intro": "Brachystelma ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
