    "intro": "Biscutella fontqueri subsp. cardonica, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada biscutella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract various pollinators. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountain environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
