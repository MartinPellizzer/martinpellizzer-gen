    "intro": "Bicornella henrici, commonly known as the Henry's two-horned plant, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its distinctive two-horned calyx at the base of its flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bicornella henrici is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
