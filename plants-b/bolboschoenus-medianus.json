    "intro": "Bolboschoenus medianus, commonly known as the intermediate bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often found in marshes and shallow water bodies. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollination and habitat for aquatic insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in wetland environments. Bolboschoenus medianus plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing shelter for various wildlife species."
