    "intro": "Brathys connata, commonly known as the Brazilian star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
