    "intro": "Bunias erucago var. echinata, commonly known as curly dock, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of large, wavy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in a tall, branched inflorescence, which later develop into elongated, beak-like seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Curly dock is known for its strong, somewhat peppery taste and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
