    "intro": "Bergenia siphilitica, commonly known as the lesser bergenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. Bergenia siphilitica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
