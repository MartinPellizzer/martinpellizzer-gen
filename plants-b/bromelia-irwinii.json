    "intro": "Bromelia irwinii, commonly known as the pink bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescence that can range from red to pink, often resembling a flower cluster. The plant features a rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a central water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Bromelia irwinii thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
