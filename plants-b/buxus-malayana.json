    "intro": "Buxus malayana, commonly known as the Malayan boxwood, is a dense evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for hedges and ornamental gardens. Buxus malayana is valued for its hardiness and ability to maintain a neat, formal appearance with minimal pruning."
