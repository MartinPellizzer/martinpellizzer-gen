    "intro": "Brenesia aspasicensis, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-orange inflorescences that resemble a misty haze, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Despite its beauty, Brenesia aspasicensis is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
