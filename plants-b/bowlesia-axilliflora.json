    "intro": "Bowlesia axilliflora, commonly known as the mountain rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a unique structure that includes showy, lip-like petals. It has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Bowlesia axilliflora is of interest to botanists due to its specialized adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat."
