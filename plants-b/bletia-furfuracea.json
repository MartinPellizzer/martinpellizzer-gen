    "intro": "Bletia furfuracea, commonly known as the woolly bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name, and it typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. Bletia furfuracea is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
