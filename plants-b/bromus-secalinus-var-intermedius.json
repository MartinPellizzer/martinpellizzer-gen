    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. intermedius, commonly known as intermediate ryegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged along the stem, with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This variety is often used in forage and turfgrass applications due to its hardiness and adaptability."
