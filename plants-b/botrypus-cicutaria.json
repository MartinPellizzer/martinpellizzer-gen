    "intro": "Botrypus cicutaria, commonly known as water starwort, is a member of the water fern family (Ceratopteris). It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Botrypus cicutaria is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality."
