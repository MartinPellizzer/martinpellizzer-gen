    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum subsp. gracile, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. This subspecies is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant genetics."
