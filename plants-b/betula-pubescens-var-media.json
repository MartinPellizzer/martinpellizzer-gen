    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. media, commonly known as the downy birch, is a medium-sized deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and peatlands. Betula pubescens var. media is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
