It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit. The plant features small, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive, pale green coloration. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on soil in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
