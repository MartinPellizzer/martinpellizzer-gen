It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators. The plant has smooth, greyish bark and long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds enclosed in a fibrous covering. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
