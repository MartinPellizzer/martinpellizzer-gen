    "intro": "Bulbophyllum injoloense, commonly known as the Injolo orchid, is a species of orchid native to Cameroon. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often displaying a striking coloration that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
