    "intro": "Bletia formosana, commonly known as the Formosan bletia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the bletia genus. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
