    "intro": "Begonia mbangaensis, commonly known as the Ngwenya begonia, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow markings. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
