    "intro": "Banksia verticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical inflorescences that produce abundant yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Its flowers provide nectar for a variety of pollinators, including honeyeaters and bees. The species is also valued for its ecological role and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental features."
