    "intro": "Bletia kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a raceme, blooming in late summer. Bletia kotoensis thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
