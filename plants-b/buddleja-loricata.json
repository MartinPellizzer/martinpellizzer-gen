    "intro": "Buddleja loricata, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja loricata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
