    "intro": "Banara tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly banara, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woolly white or grayish pubescence covering its young leaves and stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, round, yellow or orange fruits. Its leaves are large, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. Banara tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
