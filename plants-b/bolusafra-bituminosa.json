It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, simple, and elliptical leaves that are usually leathery in texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Bolusafra bituminosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its durable wood."
