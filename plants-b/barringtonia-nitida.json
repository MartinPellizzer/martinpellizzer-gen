    "intro": "Barringtonia nitida, commonly known as the slender white mahoe, is a tropical tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, showy white flowers that bloom at night. The flowers have a distinctive three-lobed shape and emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The fruit is a spiny, pendulous capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
