    "intro": "Blechnum wagnerianum, commonly known as the Wagner's shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
