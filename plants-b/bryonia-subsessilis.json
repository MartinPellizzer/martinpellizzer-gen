    "intro": "Bryonia subsessilis, commonly known as the smooth bryony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that give way to orange, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive waxy coating, and it is often found in dry, disturbed soils along roadsides and in scrublands. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided as a food plant but is of interest in botanical studies for its ecological and chemical characteristics."
