It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage, which often features intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
