It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
