    "intro": "Bromus imperialis, commonly known as the imperial brome, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Bromus imperialis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
