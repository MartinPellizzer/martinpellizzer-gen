    "intro": "Baccharis ilinissae, commonly known as white baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are often dispersed by wind. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soils. Baccharis ilinissae is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
