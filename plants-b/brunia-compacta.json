    "intro": "Brunia compacta, commonly known as the dwarf brunia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense, rounded form. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal. Brunia compacta prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to many garden settings."
