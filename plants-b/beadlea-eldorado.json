    "intro": "Beadlea eldorado, commonly known as the golden beadlea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Beadlea eldorado thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
