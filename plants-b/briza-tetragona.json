    "intro": "Briza tetragona, commonly known as the four-cornered grass or narrowleaf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Briza tetragona is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
