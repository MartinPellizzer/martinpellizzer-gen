    "intro": "Bonnaya bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or bracteated bonnaya, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne on short pedicels. Bonnaya bracteata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
