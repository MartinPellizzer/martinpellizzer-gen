    "intro": "Brathys japonica var. mucronisepala, commonly known as the Japanese brathys, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
