    "intro": "Bobea sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian bobea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-like flowers. This species is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky areas. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Bobea sandwicensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
