    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. silvestris, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, triangular, and serrated, turning golden yellow in autumn. It produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is a common pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
