It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed flowers. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
