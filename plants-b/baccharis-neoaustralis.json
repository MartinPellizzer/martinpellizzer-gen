    "intro": "Baccharis neoaustralis, commonly known as the narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its slender, often aromatic leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its woody stems and persistent leaves contribute to its resilience in arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
