These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which can range in color from blue to purple. Biarum species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in woodland or shaded areas. They have lance-shaped leaves and produce showy blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.
