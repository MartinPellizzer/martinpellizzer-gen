    "intro": "Banksia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that bear yellow to orange flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has rough, fissured bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its common name. Banksia pubescens is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
