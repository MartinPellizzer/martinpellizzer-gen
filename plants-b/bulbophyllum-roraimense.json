    "intro": "Bulbophyllum roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima torch orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. It thrives in the humid, shaded environments of high-altitude rainforests, often growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant's pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its nutrient-poor habitat. Its unique morphology and coloration make it a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
