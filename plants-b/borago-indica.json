It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer, and its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and wastelands. Borago indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine. Its seeds are also used in the production of linseed oil."
