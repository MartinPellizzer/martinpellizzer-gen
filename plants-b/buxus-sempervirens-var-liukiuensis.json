    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Liukiu boxwood, is a rare variant of the common boxwood native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it a popular choice for topiary and ornamental gardening. The leaves are typically small, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking visual contrast against its woody stems. This variety is well adapted to humid, subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
