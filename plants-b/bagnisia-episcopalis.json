    "intro": "Bagnisia episcopalis, commonly known as the sacred orchid of the highlands, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the late spring and early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often covered in a fine, silvery down that helps reflect excess sunlight. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, Bagnisia episcopalis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
