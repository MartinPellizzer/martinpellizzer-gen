    "intro": "Berula repanda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in loose clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Berula repanda is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
