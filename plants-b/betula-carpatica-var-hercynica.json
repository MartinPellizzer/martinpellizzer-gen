    "intro": "Betula carpatica var. hercynica, commonly known as the European birch or mountain birch, is a deciduous tree native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and its small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions, where it forms dense stands. This variety is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
