    "intro": "Baccharis serrulata var. linearis, commonly known as slender baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers in the fall, which are visited by various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its structure and foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
