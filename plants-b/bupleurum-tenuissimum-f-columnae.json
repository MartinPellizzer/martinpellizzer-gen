    "intro": "Bupleurum tenuissimum f. columnae, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the Bupleurum genus. It is characterized by its elongated, columnar growth habit, which sets it apart from the more typical bushy forms of its species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, often clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
