    "intro": "Bacopa sessiliflora, commonly known as narrow-leaved water hyssop, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spikes, typically from June to September. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic conditions. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in shallow water habitats. Bacopa sessiliflora is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
