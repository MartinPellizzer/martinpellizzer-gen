    "intro": "Begonia fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and fleshy, fibrous roots that help it store water. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with contrasting yellow or white markings. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Begonia fibrosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
