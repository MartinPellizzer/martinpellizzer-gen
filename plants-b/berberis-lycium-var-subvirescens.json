    "intro": "Berberis lycium var. subvirescens, commonly known as the red-flowered barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces vibrant orange to red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers, which appear in early spring."
