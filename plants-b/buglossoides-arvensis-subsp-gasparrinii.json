    "intro": "Buglossoides arvensis subsp. gasparrinii, commonly known as the Gasparrini's field bugloss, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, characterized by its hairy stems and blue or purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact growth compared to the typical form of B. arvensis. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a mechanical mechanism."
