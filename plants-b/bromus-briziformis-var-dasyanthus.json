    "intro": "Bromus briziformis var. dasyanthus, commonly known as the tufted brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming a component of native plant communities. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in arid environments."
