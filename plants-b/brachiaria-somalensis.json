    "intro": "Brachiaria somalensis, commonly known as Somalian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and can be used for forage in some regions. However, it is not widely cultivated due to its limited agronomic value compared to other grass species."
