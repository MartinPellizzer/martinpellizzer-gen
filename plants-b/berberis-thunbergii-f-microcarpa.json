    "intro": "Berberis thunbergii f. microcarpa, commonly known as Japanese barberry, is a compact, deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage. It features small, oval leaves that are typically a vibrant green in summer and turn red or orange in autumn. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist into winter. It is native to East Asia but has been widely cultivated in temperate regions for ornamental purposes. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
