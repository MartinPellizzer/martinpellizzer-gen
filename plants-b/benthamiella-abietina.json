    "intro": "Benthamiella abietina, commonly known as the mountain pine moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats, often on tree trunks or soil surfaces in mountainous regions. The plant has a dense, cushion-like growth form with closely spaced, elongated leaves that are often covered in a layer of small, translucent cells. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature. This moss is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones."
