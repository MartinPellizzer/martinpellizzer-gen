    "intro": "Begonia megaphylla, commonly known as the giant leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
