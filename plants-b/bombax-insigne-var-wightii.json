    "intro": "Bombax insigne var. wightii, commonly known as the Wight's cotton tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like birds and insects. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks."
