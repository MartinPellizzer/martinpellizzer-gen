    "intro": "Balanophora pierrei var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Vietnam. It is a mycoheterotrophic plant, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It grows in dense, shaded forest understories, often on decaying tree roots or in leaf litter. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
