    "intro": "Buda marina, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-white leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and salt marshes. Buda marina has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its visual appeal. Its botanical name reflects its marine habitat, though it is not actually a true holly."
