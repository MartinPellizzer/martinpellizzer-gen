    "intro": "Baccaurea glabriflora, commonly known as the smooth-flowered baccaurea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
