    "intro": "Boronia gravicocca, commonly known as the gravel cushion boronia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically in spring. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Boronia gravicocca is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
