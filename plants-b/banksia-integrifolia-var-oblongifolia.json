    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are usually yellow or orange in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry forests. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
