    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. rupestris, commonly known as rock cabbage, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other familiar vegetables like broccoli and cabbage. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
