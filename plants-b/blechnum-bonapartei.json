    "intro": "Blechnum bonapartei, commonly known as the Bonaparte's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
