It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
