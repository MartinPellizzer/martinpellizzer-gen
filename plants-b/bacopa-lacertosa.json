    "intro": "Bacopa lacertosa, commonly known as the rock dodder, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its succulent, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Bacopa lacertosa is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and it is often found in rocky crevices or sandy soils."
