    "intro": "Biasolettia pelia, commonly known as the African cycad, is a unique plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is a slow-growing species that can live for centuries, making it an important component of its native ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable in some regions."
