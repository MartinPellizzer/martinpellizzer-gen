    "intro": "Blepharis capensis var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate blepharis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
