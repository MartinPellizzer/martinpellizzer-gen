It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. Bolbitis dentata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
