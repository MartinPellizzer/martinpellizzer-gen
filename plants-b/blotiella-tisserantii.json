    "intro": "Blotiella tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant found in specific freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its leaves are often submerged, while its reproductive structures emerge from the water's surface. Due to its limited distribution and specialized requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
