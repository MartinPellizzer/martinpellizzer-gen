    "intro": "Baccharis truncata, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. It is drought-tolerant and has a deep root system, making it well adapted to arid environments. Baccharis truncata is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for its purported healing properties."
