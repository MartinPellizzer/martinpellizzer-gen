    "intro": "Buchnera scabridula, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a saxicolous lichen that thrives on rocky substrates. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its pale to dark green thallus with a distinctive, rough, scabrous surface. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, which contribute to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Its morphology includes a leathery cortex and a loosely structured medulla, typical of foliose lichens. Buchnera scabridula is often found in temperate regions and is used as an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
