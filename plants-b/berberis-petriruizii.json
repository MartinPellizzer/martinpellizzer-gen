It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
