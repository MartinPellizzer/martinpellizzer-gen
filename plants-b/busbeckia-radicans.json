    "intro": "Busbeckia radicans, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, oval leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid spread, it can become invasive in certain regions."
