    "intro": "Brownanthus lignescens, commonly known as the hardy brownanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its woody stems that become more fibrous with age, giving it a lignified appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Brownanthus lignescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
