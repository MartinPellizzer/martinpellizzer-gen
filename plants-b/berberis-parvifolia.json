    "intro": "Berberis parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
