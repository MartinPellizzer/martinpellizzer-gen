    "intro": "Breynia pulchella, commonly known as the coral tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red or pink bracts that resemble coral, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has a woody stem with a smooth, pale bark and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Breynia pulchella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its vibrant foliage and unique appearance."
