    "intro": "Banksia mitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow to orange flowers. The plant is part of the Proteaceae family and is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Banksia mitis plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for a variety of pollinators. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal and garden landscapes."
