    "intro": "Behen alpinus, commonly known as alpine thistle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, woolly leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Behen alpinus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
