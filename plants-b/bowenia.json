    "intro": "Bowenia, commonly known as the cycad, is a genus of ancient seed plants that belong to the family Cycadaceae. These plants are characterized by their stout trunks, feather-like leaves, and a generally slow growth rate. Native to Australia, Bowenia species are often found in coastal and subtropical regions. They thrive in well-drained soils and require a warm, humid climate. Due to their unique appearance and historical significance, they are popular in horticulture and considered living fossils."
