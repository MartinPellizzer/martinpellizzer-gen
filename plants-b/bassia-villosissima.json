    "intro": "Bassia villosissima, commonly known as sandmat or sandburs, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, which help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to conserve water in dry environments. Bassia villosissima is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
