    "intro": "Bignonia salicifolia, commonly known as the weeping willow vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, willow-like leaves that are slender and pendulous, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in woodland edges. Bignonia salicifolia is a deciduous vine that can grow quite long, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
