    "intro": "Baccharis capitata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. These flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Baccharis capitata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
