    "intro": "Banksia densa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces woody follicles that contain the seeds. Banksia densa is adapted to fire-prone environments and has a long lifespan, with some individuals living over 100 years. It plays an important role in the ecological communities of its native habitat."
