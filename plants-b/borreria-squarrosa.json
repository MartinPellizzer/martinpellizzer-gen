    "intro": "Borreria squarrosa, commonly known as the rough borreria, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its wiry, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Borreria squarrosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
