    "intro": "Bulbophyllum desmanthum, commonly known as the Yellow Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding survival in its natural habitat. The flowers are often clustered and emit a faint fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
