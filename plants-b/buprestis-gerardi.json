    "intro": "Buprestis gerardi, commonly known as the black jewel beetle, is a species of metallic wood-boring beetle native to North America. It is characterized by its striking iridescent blue or green coloration, which is often more pronounced in males. The larvae of Buprestis gerardi feed on the wood of living trees, typically in the genus *Populus* (aspen and cottonwood). The adult beetles are usually found in the spring and early summer, emerging to mate and lay eggs in the bark of host trees. Due to its ecological role in forest ecosystems, it is considered an important indicator species for healthy woodlands."
