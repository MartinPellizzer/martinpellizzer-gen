    "intro": "Baccharis wrightii, commonly known as greasewood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Baccharis wrightii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
