It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Boerhavia simonyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
