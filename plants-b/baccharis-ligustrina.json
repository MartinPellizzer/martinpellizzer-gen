    "intro": "Baccharis ligustrina, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy blue-gray flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish-brown. Baccharis ligustrina is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
