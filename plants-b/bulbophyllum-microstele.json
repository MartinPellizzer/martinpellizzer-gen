    "intro": "Bulbophyllum microstele, commonly known as the small-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features a compact growth habit with small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is appreciated for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
