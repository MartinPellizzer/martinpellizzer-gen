    "intro": "Berberis fiebrigii, commonly known as the Japanese barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features thorny stems and small, glossy green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, it has become an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
