    "intro": "Bulbophyllum toppingii, commonly known as the Topping's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its flowers are usually borne on lateral spikes and can vary in color from white to yellow and red. Bulbophyllum toppingii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
