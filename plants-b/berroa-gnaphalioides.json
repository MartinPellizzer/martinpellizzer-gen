    "intro": "Berroa gnaphalioides, commonly known as silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable plant for xeriscaping and native garden landscapes."
