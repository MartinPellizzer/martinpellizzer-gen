It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Bignonia brachypoda thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks.
