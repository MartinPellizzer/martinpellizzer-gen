    "intro": "Bouteloua griffithsii, commonly known as Griffiths' bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as limestone soils and desert margins. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
