It features upright, spiny stems and small, glossy green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping."
