    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, elongated fertile leaf that bears spore-producing structures called sorangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually divided into two unequal parts, with the upper portion being broader than the lower. This variant is distinguished from the typical Botrychium obliquum by subtle differences in leaf shape and spore morphology."
