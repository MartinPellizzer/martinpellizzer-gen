    "intro": "Brachypodium ramosum subvar. glabriflorum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered false brome, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control."
