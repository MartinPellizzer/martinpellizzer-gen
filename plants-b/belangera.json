It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent characteristics and ability to thrive in arid environments. The plant features fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it conserve water, and it produces small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. Belangera is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its striking appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
