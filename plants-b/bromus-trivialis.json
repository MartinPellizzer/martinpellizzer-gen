    "intro": "Bromus trivialis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often rolled in the wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often considered an invasive species in some regions. Bromus trivialis is valued for forage in agriculture but can outcompete native vegetation if left unchecked."
