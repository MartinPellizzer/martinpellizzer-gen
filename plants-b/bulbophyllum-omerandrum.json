    "intro": "Bulbophyllum omerandrum, commonly known as the Omerandrum orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces strikingly colored flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, making it an epiphytic species. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or orange, are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
