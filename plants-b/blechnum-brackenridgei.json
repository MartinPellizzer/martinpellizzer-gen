    "intro": "Blechnum brackenridgei, commonly known as the Brackenridge\u2019s holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
