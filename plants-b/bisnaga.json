It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange capsule that splits open when mature. Bisnaga is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
