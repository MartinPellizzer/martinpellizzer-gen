    "intro": "Bajacalia tridentata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its spiny, evergreen foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Bajacalia tridentata plays an important role in providing habitat and food for desert wildlife."
