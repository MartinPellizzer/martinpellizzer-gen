    "intro": "Bargemontia salsoloides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Bargemontia salsoloides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils in erosion-prone areas."
