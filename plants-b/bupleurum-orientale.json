    "intro": "Bupleurum orientale, commonly known as the eastern skullcap, is a perennial herb native to regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Bupleurum orientale is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties, though its botanical characteristics remain largely understudied."
