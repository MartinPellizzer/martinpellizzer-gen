It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, showy flowers with a distinctive rosy lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or branches in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators.
