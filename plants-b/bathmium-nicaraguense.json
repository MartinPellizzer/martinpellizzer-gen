    "intro": "Bathmium nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan bathmium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Nicaragua. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid climate. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, Bathmium nicaraguense is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
