    "intro": "Brachiaria bomaensis, commonly known as Boma grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soil environments. Brachiaria bomaensis is often used for forage in livestock farming due to its high nutritional value and hardiness."
