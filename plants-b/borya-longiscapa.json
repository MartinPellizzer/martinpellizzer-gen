It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Borya longiscapa plays a vital role in the ecosystems of its native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
