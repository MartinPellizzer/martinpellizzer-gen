    "intro": "Begonia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for container gardening and rockeries."
