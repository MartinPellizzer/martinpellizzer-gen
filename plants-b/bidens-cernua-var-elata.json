    "intro": "Bidens cernua var. elata, commonly known as the tall ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy beneath, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Bidens cernua var. elata is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting pollinators."
