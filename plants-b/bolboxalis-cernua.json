    "intro": "Bolboxalis cernua, commonly known as the drooping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often droop under the weight of its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals that curve outward, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Bolboxalis cernua thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
