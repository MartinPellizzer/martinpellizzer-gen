    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus subsp. affinis, commonly known as the saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal marshes and estuaries, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. Its rhizomes form dense mats, contributing to the structure of saltwater wetlands. It is an important component of the vegetation in tidal zones along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America."
