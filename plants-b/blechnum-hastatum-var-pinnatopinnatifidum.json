    "intro": "Blechnum hastatum var. pinnatopinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harts-tongue fern, is a variant of the harts-tongue fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, dark green fronds that are often described as having a lacy appearance. Its leaves are bipinnate, with secondary pinnae that are further divided into narrow, linear segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, tropical gardens."
