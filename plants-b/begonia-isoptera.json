    "intro": "Begonia isoptera, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver or white variegated leaves that provide a dramatic contrast to its deep green foliage. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental displays."
