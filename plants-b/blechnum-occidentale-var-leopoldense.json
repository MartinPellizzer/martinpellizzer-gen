    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. leopoldense, commonly known as the Leopold's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Blechnaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
