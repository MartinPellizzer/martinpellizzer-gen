    "intro": "Bromus uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapting to cold and arid environments. Bromus uralensis is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
