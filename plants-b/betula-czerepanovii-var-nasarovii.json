    "intro": "Betula czerepanovii var. nasarovii, commonly known as the Tien Shan birch, is a rare and cold-hardy shrub or small tree native to the Tien Shan mountain range in Central Asia. It is characterized by its white to pale yellow bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its small, triangular leaves that are usually pubescent beneath. The plant produces catkins and small, cone-like fruiting structures, typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high elevations with well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
