    "intro": "Brosimum rotundatum, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Moraceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex sap has historically been used for rubber production, though it is less commercially significant than Hevea brasiliensis. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and thrives in tropical climates with high humidity."
