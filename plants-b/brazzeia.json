    "intro": "Brazzeia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Brazzeia grandiflora, which is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Brazzeia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and the rarity of some species, Brazzeia is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
