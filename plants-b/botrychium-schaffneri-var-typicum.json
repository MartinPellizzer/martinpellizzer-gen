    "intro": "Botrychium schaffneri var. typicum, commonly known as the Schaffner's moonwort, is a rare fern species belonging to the Botrychium genus. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing sorus that is covered by a fleshy, cup-like structure called a peristome. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky habitats. It has a short, creeping rhizome with pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
