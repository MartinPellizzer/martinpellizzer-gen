    "intro": "Baccharis pingraea var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the fall. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it a common component of coastal vegetation and a useful plant for erosion control."
