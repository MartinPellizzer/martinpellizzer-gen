    "intro": "Breynia subangustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf breynia, is a succulent shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its stems are woody and can branch out, forming a compact, bushy structure. Breynia subangustifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
