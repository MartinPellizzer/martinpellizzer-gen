    "intro": "Bouteloua foenea, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout the central and southern United States. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has fine, blue-green leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. Blue grama plays an important role in maintaining grassland ecosystems and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
