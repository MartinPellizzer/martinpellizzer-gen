    "intro": "Banisteriopsis nigrescens, commonly known as the black-bark bignay, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon basin, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
