    "intro": "Blephariglottis longicornu, commonly known as the longhorned mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Cordia*, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and have a leathery texture. Blephariglottis longicornu is native to regions of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Ecuador."
