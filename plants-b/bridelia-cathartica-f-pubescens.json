    "intro": "Bridelia cathartica f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bridelia, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage, which gives it its specific epithet \"pubescens.\" The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly rough texture and a distinctive, aromatic scent. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as food for certain wildlife. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
