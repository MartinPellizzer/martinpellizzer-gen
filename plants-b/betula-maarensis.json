    "intro": "Betula maarensis, commonly known as the Maaren birch, is a species of birch native to the subarctic regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are oval to ovate, with serrated margins, and turn yellow in the autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forests and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
