    "intro": "Baccharis ulicina, commonly known as coastal baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils along the coast and is often found in dune ecosystems. It has a woody stem with numerous branches and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
