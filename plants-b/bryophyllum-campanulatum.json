    "intro": "Bryophyllum campanulatum, commonly known as the \"Lipstick Plant,\" is a succulent species native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its ability to propagate through leaf cuttings makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Bryophyllum campanulatum thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish."
