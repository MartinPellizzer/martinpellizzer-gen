    "intro": "Balanophora dioica, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Balanophoraceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, fleshy, reddish stems. It produces separate male and female flowers, which are often hidden within its dense, leafless structure. Balanophora dioica is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments."
