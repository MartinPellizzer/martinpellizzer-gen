    "intro": "Brachystele oxyanthos, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its leaves are small and strap-like, while its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brachystele oxyanthos is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
