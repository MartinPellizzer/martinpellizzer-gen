    "intro": "Bursera littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bursera, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to coastal regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish flowers followed by small, spiky fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Bursera littoralis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
