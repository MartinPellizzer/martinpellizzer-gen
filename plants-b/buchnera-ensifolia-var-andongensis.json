    "intro": "Buchnera ensifolia var. andongensis, commonly known as the Andong Buchnera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Korea. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
