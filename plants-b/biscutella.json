These plants are typically small, herbaceous perennials with simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, characteristic of the mustard family. Biscutella species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing in rocky or arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
