    "intro": "Bilabrella thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's bilabrella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive bilabiate (two-lipped) flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are simple and opposite, with a rough texture, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological adaptations."
