    "intro": "Berberis candidula, commonly known as the white barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. The berries are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
