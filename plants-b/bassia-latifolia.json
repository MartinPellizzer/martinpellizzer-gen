    "intro": "Bassia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense heads, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds. Bassia latifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
