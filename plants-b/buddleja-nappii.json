    "intro": "Buddleja nappii, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The flowers, which are typically pink or purple, attract a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Buddleja nappii is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
