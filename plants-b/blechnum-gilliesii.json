    "intro": "Blechnum gilliesii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, brownish layer of old spores. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique botanical feature."
