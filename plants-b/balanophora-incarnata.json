    "intro": "Balanophora incarnata, commonly known as the Indian ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of India and Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its specialized roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is therefore unable to perform photosynthesis, relying instead on its host for sustenance. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in a spike, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Balanophora incarnata is considered a conservation concern."
