It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that resemble those of true ferns, though it is not a true fern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Biophytum adiantoides thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
