It is characterized by its grayish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in temperate regions along the Pacific coast. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
