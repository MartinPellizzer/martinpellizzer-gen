    "intro": "Brachypodium japonicum var. minus, commonly known as Japanese false brome, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
