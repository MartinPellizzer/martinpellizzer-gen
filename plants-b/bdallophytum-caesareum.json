    "intro": "Bdallophytum caesareum, commonly known as the blue-flowered rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are blue or purple and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bdallophytum caesareum is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
