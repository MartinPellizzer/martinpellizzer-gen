    "intro": "Bombax vargasii, commonly known as the Vargas's silk cotton tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and smooth, pale bark. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, often with a slightly wavy margin. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fibrous seed pods."
