    "intro": "Bouteloua eriopoda var. eriostachya, commonly known as black grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and tufted inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock. Its ecological significance is further enhanced by its ability to persist under grazing pressure."
