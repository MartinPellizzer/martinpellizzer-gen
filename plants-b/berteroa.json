    "intro": "Berteroa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and the southwestern United States. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. They typically have hairy, ribbed stems and heart-shaped leaves. Berteroa species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
