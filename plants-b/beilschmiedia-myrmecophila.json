    "intro": "Beilschmiedia myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique botanical feature of producing specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and competing plants by aggressively defending it. The plant also produces small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and a faint aromatic scent. It flowers with inconspicuous greenish-white blooms and produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds."
