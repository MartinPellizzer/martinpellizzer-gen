    "intro": "Begonia zygia, commonly known as the zigzag begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, zigzag-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Begonia zygia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
