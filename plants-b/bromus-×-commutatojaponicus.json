    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 commutatojaponicus, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a perennial grass species resulting from the cross between Bromus commutatus and Bromus japonicus. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-gray sheen. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on environmental conditions and genetic background."
