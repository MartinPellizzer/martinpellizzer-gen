    "intro": "Bactris cohune, commonly known as the cohune palm, is a member of the Arecaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is a tall, slender palm that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, with long, pinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to coconuts. Its trunk is fibrous and often used for thatching or as a source of fibers in traditional crafts. The cohune palm is well adapted to coastal and lowland environments, making it an important species in its native ecosystems."
