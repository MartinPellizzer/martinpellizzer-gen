    "intro": "Bastardia viscosa var. sanctae-crucis, commonly known as the Jerusalem carnation, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its resilience and ornamental value have made it a popular choice in horticulture."
