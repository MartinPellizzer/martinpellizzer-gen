It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, cup-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that die back after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
