    "intro": "Bossiaea obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaved bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained sandy or loamy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate, often with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is adapted to withstand dry conditions. Bossiaea obovata is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators."
