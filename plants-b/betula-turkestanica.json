    "intro": "Betula turkestanica, commonly known as the Turkestan birch, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular and serrated, turning yellow in the fall. Betula turkestanica is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and is often found in alpine regions."
