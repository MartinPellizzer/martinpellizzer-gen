    "intro": "Bertya polymorpha var. mitchelliana, commonly known as Mitchell's bertya, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is generally compact, with multiple stems arising from the base, making it suitable for rockeries or coastal gardens. The species is notable for its adaptability to saline and sandy soils, reflecting its natural habitat along the shoreline."
