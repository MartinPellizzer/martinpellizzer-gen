    "intro": "Betula nigra, commonly known as river birch, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery strips. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a serrated edge and turn yellow in the fall. Betula nigra is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist soils."
