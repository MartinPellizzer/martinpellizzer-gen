    "intro": "Blechnum glandulosum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale fern, is a variant of the genus Blechnum, which belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing sorus clusters located on the undersides of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
