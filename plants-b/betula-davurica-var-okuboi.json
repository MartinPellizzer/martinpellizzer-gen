    "intro": "Betula davurica var. okuboi, commonly known as the Okuboi birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white to pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are triangular to oval, with serrated margins and a pale green underside, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardiness."
