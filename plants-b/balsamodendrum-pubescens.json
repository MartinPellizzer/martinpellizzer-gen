    "intro": "Balsamodendrum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy balsam tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in inflorescences. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Balsamodendrum pubescens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
