    "intro": "Buxus excisa, commonly known as the silver leaf boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its narrow, elongated leaves. The plant typically reaches a height of 1 to 2 meters and is often cultivated as a hedging plant or topiary due to its ability to maintain a neat shape. Its leaves are glossy and dark green on the upper surface, contrasting with the lighter underside. Buxus excisa prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments."
