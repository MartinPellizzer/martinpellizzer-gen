    "intro": "Babiana striata var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved rain lily, is a striking bulbous perennial native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched stems with showy, salmon-pink to orange flowers. The plant blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its bulbs are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The variety 'planifolia' is distinguished by its flat, broad leaves compared to the typical narrow leaves of the species."
