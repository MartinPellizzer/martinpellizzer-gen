    "intro": "Bulbophyllum macranthoides, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces strikingly large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
