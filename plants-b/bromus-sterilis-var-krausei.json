It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
