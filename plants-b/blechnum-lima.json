    "intro": "Blechnum lima, commonly known as the lima fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil while also storing nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is more pronounced in related genera."
