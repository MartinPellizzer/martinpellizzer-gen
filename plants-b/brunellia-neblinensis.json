    "intro": "Brunellia neblinensis, commonly known as the misty forest tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the humid, lowland tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in the moist, shaded environments it inhabits. The tree plays a vital ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
