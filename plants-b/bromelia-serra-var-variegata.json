    "intro": "Bromelia serra var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated mountain bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It features tall, narrow leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, creating a visually appealing contrast. The plant produces tall, spathaceous inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
