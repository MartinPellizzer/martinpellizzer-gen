    "intro": "Brachypodium caespitosum, commonly known as spike grass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed but is also used in ecological restoration projects."
