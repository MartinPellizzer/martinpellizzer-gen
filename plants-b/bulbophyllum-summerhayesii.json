    "intro": "Bulbophyllum summerhayesii, commonly known as the Summerhayes' orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
