It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. Its vibrant flowers, often in red or orange hues, bloom briefly before withering. Bromelia amazonica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
