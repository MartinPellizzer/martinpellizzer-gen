    "intro": "Botryodendrum, commonly known as the \"starfruit tree,\" is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are highly valued for their flavor and nutritional content. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit. Botryodendrum species typically grow as small trees or shrubs, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The fruit, which is harvested when mature, contains a sweet, tangy pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer."
