    "intro": "Benzoin aestivale f. xanthocarpum, commonly known as the yellow-seeded benzoin, is a variant of the benzoin plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic resinous exudate, which is often harvested for its fragrant properties. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in humid, well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often yellow in color, giving the variety its name."
