It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and drought-prone environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
