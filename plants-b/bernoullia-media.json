    "intro": "Bernoullia media, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
