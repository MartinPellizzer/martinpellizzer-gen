    "intro": "Begonia verecunda, commonly known as the pink begonia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting green or white center. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and slightly serrated. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia verecunda is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and ease of care in the right conditions."
