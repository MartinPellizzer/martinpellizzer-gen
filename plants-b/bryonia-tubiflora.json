    "intro": "Bryonia tubiflora, commonly known as the tuberous bryony, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its poisonous nature, it is often avoided in gardens and requires careful handling."
