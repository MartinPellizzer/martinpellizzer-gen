    "intro": "Begonia sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in low-light conditions, making it ideal for shaded garden areas or indoor environments. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. Its flowers are typically small, clustered in inflorescences, and can range in color from white to pink or red. Due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
