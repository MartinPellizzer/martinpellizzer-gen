    "intro": "Bromelia alta, commonly known as the tall bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and stiff, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Bromelia alta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments."
