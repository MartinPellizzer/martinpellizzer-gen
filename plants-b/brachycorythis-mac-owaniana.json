    "intro": "Brachycorythis mac-owaniana, commonly known as the Macowan's brachycoryth, is a unique member of the family Meliaceae, native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive yellowish or greenish hue. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
