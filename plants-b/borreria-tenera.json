It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Borreria tenera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
