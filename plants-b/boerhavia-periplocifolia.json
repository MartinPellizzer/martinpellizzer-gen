It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its stems are branched and can spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Boerhavia periplocifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry conditions."
