    "intro": "Bromus alopecuros var. calvus, commonly known as the silky brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silky texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its adaptability and spread. This variety is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
