    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum subsp. tenuissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf boldo, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, giving it a distinct appearance compared to other species in the genus. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
