It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive on tree trunks or branches. Its leaves are usually leathery and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers, which bloom in clusters, feature intricate patterns and are often pollinated by specific insect species."
