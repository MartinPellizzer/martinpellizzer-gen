It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that often display intricate patterns of green, red, and silver. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
