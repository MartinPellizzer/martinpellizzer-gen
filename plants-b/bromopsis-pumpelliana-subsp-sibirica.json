    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower spikes in the summer, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental grass in colder regions."
