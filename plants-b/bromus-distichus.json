    "intro": "Bromus distichus, commonly known as the two-row brome, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing two rows of small, awned florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Bromus distichus is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
