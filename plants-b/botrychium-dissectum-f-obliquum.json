    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum f. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, divided fronds that resemble a moon's surface, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a single, terminal structure called a sorus, which is a unique feature of the genus Botrychium. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is noted for its delicate, ephemeral appearance."
