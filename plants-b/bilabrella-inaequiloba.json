It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its distinctive bilabiate (two-lipped) flowers, which are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Bilabrella inaequiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral structure."
