    "intro": "Balanophora indica var. globosa, commonly known as the Indian ghost flower, is a rare and highly specialized parasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, often yellowish or reddish stems and its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom underground. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
