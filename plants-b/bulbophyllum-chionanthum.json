It features a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike. The plant is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. This species is prized for its ornamental value and unique floral appearance."
