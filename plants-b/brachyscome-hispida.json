    "intro": "Brachyscome hispida, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or stinkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fluffy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that give it a rough texture and contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Despite its ornamental appeal, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
