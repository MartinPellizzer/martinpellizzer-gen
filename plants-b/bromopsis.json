    "intro": "Bromopsis, commonly known as the rock grass or rock sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. These plants are characterized by their grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Bromopsis species are generally hardy and adapted to harsh climates, making them resilient to cold and poor soil conditions. They play a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
