    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cyclophyllum, commonly known as the cyclophyll orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its bulbs are an essential part of its growth cycle, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
