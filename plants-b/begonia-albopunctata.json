    "intro": "Begonia albopunctata, commonly known as the white-spotted begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and distinctive white spots. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture for indoor and outdoor gardens."
