    "intro": "Bromelia ananas subvar. pyramidalis-variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, strap-like leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces an inflorescence with red bracts and yellow flowers, adding dramatic visual interest. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
