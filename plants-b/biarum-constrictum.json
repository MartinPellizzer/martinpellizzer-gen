    "intro": "Biarum constrictum, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces striking, tubular, violet-colored flowers. The plant has a unique structure with a single, long, winding stem that supports its foliage and floral displays. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly bees and wasps. Biarum constrictum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
