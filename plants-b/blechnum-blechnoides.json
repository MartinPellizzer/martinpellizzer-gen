    "intro": "Blechnum blechnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It is native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil and Paraguay, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
