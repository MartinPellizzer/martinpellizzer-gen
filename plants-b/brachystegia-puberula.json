    "intro": "Brachystegia puberula, commonly known as the African brachystegia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits. It is often found in miombo woodlands and plays a significant role in local ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in reforestation efforts in degraded areas."
