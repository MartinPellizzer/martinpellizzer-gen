    "intro": "Bromus digitatus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bromus digitatus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
