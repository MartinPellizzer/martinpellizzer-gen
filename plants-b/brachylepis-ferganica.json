    "intro": "Brachylepis ferganica, commonly known as the Fergana bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in steppes and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Brachylepis ferganica is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
