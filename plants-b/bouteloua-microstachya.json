    "intro": "Bouteloua microstachya, commonly known as blue grama, is a native North American grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. It is a warm-season perennial that thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. Its roots form dense networks that help prevent soil erosion and support soil health. Blue grama is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in native plant landscaping."
