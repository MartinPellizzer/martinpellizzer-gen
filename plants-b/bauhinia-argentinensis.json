    "intro": "Bauhinia argentinensis, commonly known as the Argentine burrbean tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of a hand. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Bauhinia argentinensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
