    "intro": "Benthamidia florida f. xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow-fruited benthamidia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its striking yellow berries. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant features small, simple leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit, which is typically fleshy and yellow, is an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
