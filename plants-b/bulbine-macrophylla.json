It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
