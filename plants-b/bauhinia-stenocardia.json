    "intro": "Bauhinia stenocardia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. Bauhinia stenocardia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
