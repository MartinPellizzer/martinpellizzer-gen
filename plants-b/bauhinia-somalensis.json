    "intro": "Bauhinia somalensis, commonly known as the Somali flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Somalia and parts of East Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Bauhinia somalensis is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
