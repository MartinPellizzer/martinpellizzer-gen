    "intro": "Brenesia balaeniceps, commonly known as the whalehead orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure that resembles the head of a whale, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant features a single, showy flower with a prominent, spurred lip that is often brightly colored. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Brenesia balaeniceps is considered a rare and endangered species."
