It is a perennial shrub native to Brazil, characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. Barrosoa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it both a notable ornamental plant and a species of ecological interest."
