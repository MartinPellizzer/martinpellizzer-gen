    "intro": "Bromus secalinus subsp. infestus, commonly known as the Italian ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct ligule. The plant produces dense spikes of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
