    "intro": "Balanophora ceracea, commonly known as the silky orchid, is a holoparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, leaf-like structures called phylloclades. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing on the roots of other plants. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
