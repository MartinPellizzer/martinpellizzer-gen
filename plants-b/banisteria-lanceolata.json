    "intro": "Banisteria lanceolata, commonly known as the arrowroot vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in warm climates."
