    "intro": "Begonia pilosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia pilosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
