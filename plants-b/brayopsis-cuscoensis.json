    "intro": "Brayopsis cuscoensis, commonly known as the Cusco spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with closely packed leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can retain adequate humidity. Brayopsis cuscoensis is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Ecuador. Its simple morphology and specialized adaptations make it an important component of its ecological niche."
