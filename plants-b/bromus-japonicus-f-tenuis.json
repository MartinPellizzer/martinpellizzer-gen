    "intro": "Bromus japonicus f. tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces small, pale green or brown spikelets. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a rough texture, which helps distinguish it from other brome species. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
