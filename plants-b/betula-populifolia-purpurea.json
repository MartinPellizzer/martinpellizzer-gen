    "intro": "Betula populifolia purpurea, commonly known as the purple poplar, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn a striking purple hue in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and its bark is smooth and often peels in thin layers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. This species is valued for its rapid growth and historical use in timber production."
