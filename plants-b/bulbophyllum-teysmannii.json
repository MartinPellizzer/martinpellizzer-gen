    "intro": "Bulbophyllum teysmannii, commonly known as the Teyssmann's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often displaying vivid colors such as yellow, orange, or red. It thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
