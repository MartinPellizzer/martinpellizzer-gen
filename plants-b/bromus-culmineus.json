    "intro": "Bromus culmineus, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open, disturbed habitats. Bromus culmineus is adapted to cold climates and is often an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
