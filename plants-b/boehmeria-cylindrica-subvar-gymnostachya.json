    "intro": "Boehmeria cylindrica subvar. gymnostachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horse-hair grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for making textiles and paper due to their strong, flexible fibers."
