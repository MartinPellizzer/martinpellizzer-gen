    "intro": "Baphia kirkii subsp. ovata, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by flat, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
