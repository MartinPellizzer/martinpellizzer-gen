    "intro": "Bupleurum semicompositum f. platyphyllum, commonly known as the flat-leafed bupleurum, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to specific regions of China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, flat, and broad leaves that are often arranged in a rosette formation. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
