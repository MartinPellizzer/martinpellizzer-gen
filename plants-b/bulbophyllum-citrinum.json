    "intro": "Bulbophyllum citrinum, commonly known as the Yellow Bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
