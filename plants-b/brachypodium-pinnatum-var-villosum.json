    "intro": "Brachypodium pinnatum var. villosum, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
