It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with small flowers that are typically submerged. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species for aquatic biodiversity."
