    "intro": "Begonia minutitepala, commonly known as the miniature tepal begonia, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically measure less than 1 centimeter in diameter. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with petals that are nearly fused, giving the appearance of a single, intricate bloom. Begonia minutitepala is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
