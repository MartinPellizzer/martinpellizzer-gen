    "intro": "Bromus mutabilis var. secalinus, commonly known as the yellow brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that mature to a yellowish-brown color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in appearance, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. Due to its adaptability, it can be both a weed and a forage crop depending on the context."
