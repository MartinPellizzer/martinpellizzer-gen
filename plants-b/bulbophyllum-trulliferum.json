    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trulliferum, commonly known as the coral spike orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of long, slender spikes bearing numerous small, coral-like flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its bulbs are an essential part of its growth cycle, storing nutrients for periods of dormancy. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
