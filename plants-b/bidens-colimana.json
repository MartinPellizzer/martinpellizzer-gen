    "intro": "Bidens colimana, commonly known as the Mexican ironweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Bidens colimana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
