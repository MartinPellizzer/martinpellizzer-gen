    "intro": "Bellevalia parva, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, featuring basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
