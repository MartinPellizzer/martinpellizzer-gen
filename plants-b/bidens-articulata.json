    "intro": "Bidens articulata, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers with five petals. The plant produces numerous seeds that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs, aiding in their dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in roadsides, fields, and wetlands. Bidens articulata is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
