    "intro": "Begonia koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's begonia, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep red or purple, with a contrasting green underside. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique foliage and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among collectors and botanists."
