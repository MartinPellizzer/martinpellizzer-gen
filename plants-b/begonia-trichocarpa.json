    "intro": "Begonia trichocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its stems are often hairy and can grow trailing or upright depending on the environment. Begonia trichocarpa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
