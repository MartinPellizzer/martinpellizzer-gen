    "intro": "Bassia junghuhniana, commonly known as the Tibetan sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Bassia junghuhniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
