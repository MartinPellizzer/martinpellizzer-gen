    "intro": "Botrychium subcarnosum, commonly known as the false moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called sorangia, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Botrychium subcarnosum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its distinctive, almost succulent appearance."
