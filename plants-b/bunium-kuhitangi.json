    "intro": "Bunium kuhitangi, commonly known as the Kuhitanga fennel, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, often pungent scent when crushed. The seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
