    "intro": "Bromus pumpellianus var. villosissimus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often have a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
