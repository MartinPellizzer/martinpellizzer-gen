    "intro": "Brunella, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or limestone soils. Brunella species typically produce showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and the plants tend to be perennial, thriving in well-drained environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom in full sun."
