It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound umbels of small, white or greenish flowers. The leaves are typically pinnately divided, with a fern-like appearance, and are often aromatic. Bobrovia species are native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, and they thrive in moist, well-drained soils. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental garden plants due to their delicate foliage and fragrance."
