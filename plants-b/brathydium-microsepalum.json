    "intro": "Brathydium microsepalum, commonly known as the small-sepal brathydium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in compact umbels. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, which splits into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Brathydium microsepalum is notable for its subtle botanical features and is often overlooked due to its modest appearance."
