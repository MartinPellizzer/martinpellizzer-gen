    "intro": "Bromheadia alticola, commonly known as the alpine bromheadia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water in its natural habitat. The flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, adapted to attract pollinators. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
