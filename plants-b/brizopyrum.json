It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The flowers are typically small, clustered in umbels, and often have a pink or white color. Brizopyrum species are found in temperate regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
