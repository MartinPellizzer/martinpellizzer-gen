    "intro": "Begonia anserina, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from both its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
