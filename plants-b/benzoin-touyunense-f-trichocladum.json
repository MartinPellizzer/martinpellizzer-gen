    "intro": "Benzoin touyunense f. trichocladum, commonly known as the hairy-leaf benzoin, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, characterized by its aromatic resins and tropical to subtropical habitat preferences. The plant is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and contributes to its ecological niche. Its leaves are typically alternate and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential medicinal properties."
