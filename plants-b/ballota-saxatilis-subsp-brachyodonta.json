    "intro": "Ballota saxatilis subsp. brachyodonta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ballota, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes and cliffs. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
