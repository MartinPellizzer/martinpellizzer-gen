    "intro": "Betula medwediewii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its slender, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula medwediewii is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures."
