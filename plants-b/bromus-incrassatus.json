    "intro": "Bromus incrassatus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Bromus incrassatus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides."
