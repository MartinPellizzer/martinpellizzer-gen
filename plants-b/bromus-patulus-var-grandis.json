It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in open habitats such as meadows and along roadsides. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, which can impact native plant communities. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and habitat restoration efforts."
