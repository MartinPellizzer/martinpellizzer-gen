    "intro": "Buda glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf plant, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps to reduce water loss in its dry environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. Buda glandulosa is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
