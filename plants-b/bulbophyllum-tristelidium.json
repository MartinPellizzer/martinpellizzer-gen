    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tristelidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its striking white flowers resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique structure with a single, elongated stem and a single flower that blooms in the evening. It is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a symbol of the delicate balance of tropical ecosystems."
