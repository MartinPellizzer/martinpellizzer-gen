    "intro": "Bilabrella weberiana, commonly known as the Weber's bilabrella, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
