    "intro": "Betula alba var. globosa, commonly known as the weeping birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its distinctive cascading branches. This tree is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are oval and serrated, turning yellow in autumn, while its bark is smooth and white with a pale greenish tint. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often planted in gardens and parks for its visual appeal."
