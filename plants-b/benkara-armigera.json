    "intro": "Benkara armigera, commonly known as the Indian meal moth, is a species of insect rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. However, it is often associated with stored grains and can cause significant damage to agricultural products. The larvae of this species feed on a variety of dried foods, including cereals, nuts, and dried fruits. Its life cycle includes four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The adult moths are small, with a wingspan of about 12-15 mm, and are typically gray or brown in color."
