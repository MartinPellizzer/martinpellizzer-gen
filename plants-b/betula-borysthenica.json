    "intro": "Betula borysthenica, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a lighter inner layer, a feature that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the autumn before falling. Betula borysthenica is well adapted to grow in poor, sandy soils and is often found in taiga and tundra ecosystems."
