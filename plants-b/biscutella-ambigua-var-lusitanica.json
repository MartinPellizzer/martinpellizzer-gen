    "intro": "Biscutella ambigua var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian biscuit plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
