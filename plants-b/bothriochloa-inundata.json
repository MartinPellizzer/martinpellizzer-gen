    "intro": "Bothriochloa inundata, commonly known as water grass or swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Bothriochloa inundata plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
