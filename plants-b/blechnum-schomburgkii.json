    "intro": "Blechnum schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, harts-tongue-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are leathery and have a rough, textured surface, which helps it retain moisture. Blechnum schomburgkii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
