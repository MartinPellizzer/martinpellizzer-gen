    "intro": "Braya eschscholtziana, commonly known as Eschscholtz's bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its scientific name reflects its discovery by the botanist Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz, and it is known for its distinctive seed pods that resemble bladders."
