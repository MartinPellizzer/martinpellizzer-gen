    "intro": "Baccharoides lasiopus, commonly known as the rough baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and thrives in coastal and inland dune environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
