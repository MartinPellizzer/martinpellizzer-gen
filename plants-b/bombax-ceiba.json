    "intro": "Bombax ceiba, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in the rainy season. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its trunk is often buttressed, and it can grow up to 30 meters tall. The bark and fibers of the tree have been used traditionally for various purposes, including making cloth and paper."
