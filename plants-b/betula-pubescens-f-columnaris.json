    "intro": "Betula pubescens f. columnaris, commonly known as the silver birch columnaris, is a unique form of the silver birch characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. It is a deciduous tree with smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
