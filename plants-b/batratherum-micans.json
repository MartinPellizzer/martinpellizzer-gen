    "intro": "Batratherum micans, commonly known as the sensitive plant or Mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous annual plant native to South America. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by velvety, spherical seed pods. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its unique defensive mechanism and rapid leaf movement make it a popular subject in botanical studies."
