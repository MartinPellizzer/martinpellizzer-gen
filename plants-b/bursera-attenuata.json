    "intro": "Bursera attenuata, commonly known as desert hackberry, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Bursera attenuata is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in desert ecosystems."
