    "intro": "Begonia melanobullata, commonly known as the black-bullate begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia melanobullata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and elegant floral display."
