    "intro": "Begonia fagopyrofolia, commonly known as the silver-leaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety silver-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and often have a subtle sheen. It produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in the spring. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
