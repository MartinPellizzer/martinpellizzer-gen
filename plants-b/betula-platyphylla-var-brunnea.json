    "intro": "Betula platyphylla var. brunnea, commonly known as the black birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age, and its alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The species is valued for its ornamental bark and historical use in traditional medicine."
