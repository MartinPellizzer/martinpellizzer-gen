    "intro": "Brachyglottis buchananii, commonly known as the small-leaved flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads. It is typically found in rocky or coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
