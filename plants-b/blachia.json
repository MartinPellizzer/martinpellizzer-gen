These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Blachia species are typically evergreen and thrive in humid, well-drained soil. They are popular houseplants due to their compact size and ability to bloom year-round under proper care. The genus includes several species, with Blachia coerulea being one of the most commonly cultivated varieties."
