    "intro": "Beilschmiedia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu beilschmiedia, is a rare evergreen tree native to the high-altitude rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
