    "intro": "Brassiopsis rolandoi, commonly known as the Roland's brassia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
