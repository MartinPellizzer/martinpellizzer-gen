    "intro": "Balanophora alutacea, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a mycoheterotrophic plant native to Southeast Asia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrition. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces delicate, white or greenish flowers. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest understories. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is rarely seen and has limited distribution."
