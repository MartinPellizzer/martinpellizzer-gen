It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
