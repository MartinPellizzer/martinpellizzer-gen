    "intro": "Buxus obcordata variegata, commonly known as the variegated boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage, which features a striking combination of dark green and white or yellow variegation. The leaves are small, leathery, and arranged in compact clusters, giving the plant a neat, formal appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and is relatively disease-resistant."
