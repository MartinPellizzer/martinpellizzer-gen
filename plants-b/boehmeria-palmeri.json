    "intro": "Boehmeria palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's hemp, is a flowering plant in the nettle family, Urticaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its fibrous stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fibrous stalks have been historically used for making textiles and paper. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
