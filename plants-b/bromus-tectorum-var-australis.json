    "intro": "Bromus tectorum var. australis, commonly known as the Australian downy brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. This variety is adapted to low-nutrient environments and can spread aggressively through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
