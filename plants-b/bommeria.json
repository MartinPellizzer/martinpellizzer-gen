    "intro": "Bommeria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that often have a silvery or grayish appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Bommeria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
