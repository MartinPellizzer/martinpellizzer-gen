    "intro": "Brassia chloroleuca, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking white petals with green veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Brassia chloroleuca is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
