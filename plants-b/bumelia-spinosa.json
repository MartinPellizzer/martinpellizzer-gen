    "intro": "Bumelia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive spiny stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Bumelia spinosa typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
