    "intro": "Badula arborea, commonly known as the tree fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, fibrous layer. The plant has a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help anchor the plant and absorb nutrients from the soil. Badula arborea is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
