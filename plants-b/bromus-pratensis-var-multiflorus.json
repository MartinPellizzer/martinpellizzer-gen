    "intro": "Bromus pratensis var. multiflorus, commonly known as the meadow brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, each bearing several small, two-lobed flowers. The seeds are small and three-angled, adapted for wind dispersal, contributing to its widespread distribution."
