    "intro": "Brachypodium phoenicoides var. villosum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
