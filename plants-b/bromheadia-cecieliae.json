    "intro": "Bromheadia cecieliae, commonly known as the Celestial Bromhead, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central America. This plant is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of red and orange. The leaves are narrow, strap-like, and form a rosette that collects moisture, typical of bromeliads adapted to humid environments. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and conservatories."
