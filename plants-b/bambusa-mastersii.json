    "intro": "Bambusa mastersii, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a clump-forming grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast beautifully with its dark green leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 meters, with slender, hollow stems that are often used in traditional crafts. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bambusa mastersii is well-suited for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth rate."
