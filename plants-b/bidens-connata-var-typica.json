    "intro": "Bidens connata var. typica, commonly known as the narrowleaf beggarweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. The leaves are typically narrow and have a serrated edge, often appearing in pairs along the stem. This plant is an annual weed that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. It plays a role in ecological succession but can be considered invasive in some regions."
