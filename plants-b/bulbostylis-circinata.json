    "intro": "Bulbostylis circinata, commonly known as the spiral sedge, is a small perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its unique feature is the tightly coiled, spiral arrangement of its flowering spikes, which gives it its common name. Bulbostylis circinata typically grows in wet or marshy habitats and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks."
