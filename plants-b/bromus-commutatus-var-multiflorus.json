    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multiflorous brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green coloration, and it flowers from late spring to early summer. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
