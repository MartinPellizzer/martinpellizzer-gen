    "intro": "Briza nigra, commonly known as black false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces dark purple to black flowers, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Briza nigra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
