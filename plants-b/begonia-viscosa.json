    "intro": "Begonia viscosa, commonly known as the sticky begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and deterring herbivores. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and a spurred calyx, adding to its ornamental value. Begonia viscosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its unique foliage and attractive blooms."
