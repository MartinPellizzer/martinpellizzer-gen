    "intro": "Bactris sphaerocarpa var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm heart, is a small, slow-growing palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact stature, with a short trunk and a crown of narrow, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that develop into edible, round fruits resembling small pineapples. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its ornamental value and limited size, it is popular in horticulture as a container plant."
