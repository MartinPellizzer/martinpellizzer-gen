    "intro": "Bucculina aspera, commonly known as the rough-edged sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a rough, textured skin. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied for its ecological role in marine ecosystems. It feeds primarily on algae and is known for its ability to secrete a defensive mucus. Its reproductive system includes both male and female reproductive organs, allowing for hermaphroditism."
