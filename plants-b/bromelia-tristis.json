    "intro": "Bromelia tristis, commonly known as the weeping bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces vibrant red flowers that emerge from the center of the leaf rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
