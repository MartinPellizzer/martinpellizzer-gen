    "intro": "Begonia oregana, commonly known as the Oregon begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological balance. Begonia oregana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
