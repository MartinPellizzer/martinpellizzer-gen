    "intro": "Bromelia dilatata, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding structure. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that can last for several months, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
