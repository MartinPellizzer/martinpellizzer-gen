    "intro": "Bauhinia cornifolia, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The leaves are bipinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. The tree produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous membrane. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
