    "intro": "Beilschmiedia morobensis, commonly known as the Morobe beilschmiedia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits containing dark purple seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
