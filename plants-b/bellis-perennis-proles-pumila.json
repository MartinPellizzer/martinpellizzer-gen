It features a rosette of basal leaves and produces daisy-like flowers with white petals surrounding a yellow central disk. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides.
