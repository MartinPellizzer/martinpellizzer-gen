    "intro": "Bouteloua oligostachya, commonly known as blue grama, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that are typically pale blue to silver in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, often forming dense stands in prairies and grasslands. Blue grama is an important forage plant for livestock and also plays a key role in stabilizing soil in native ecosystems."
