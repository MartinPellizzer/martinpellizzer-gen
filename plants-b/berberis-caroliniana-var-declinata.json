    "intro": "Berberis caroliniana var. declinata, commonly known as the Carolina barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically dark green and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
