    "intro": "Begonia barkeri, commonly known as the Barker's begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It features striking, velvety foliage with deep green leaves that have a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting veining. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
