It is characterized by its striking, fiery red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a contrasting yellow or orange throat. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-like, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant blooms. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
