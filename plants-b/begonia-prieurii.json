    "intro": "Begonia prieurii, commonly known as the Prieur's begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with red, purple, or green hues. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
