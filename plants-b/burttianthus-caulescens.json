It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by insects. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
