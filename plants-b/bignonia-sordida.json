    "intro": "Bignonia sordida, commonly known as the stinking bignonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. Its most distinctive feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in the evening. Bignonia sordida is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
