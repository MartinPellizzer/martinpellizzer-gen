    "intro": "Byrsonima intermedia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy soursop, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, pubescent stems and broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces large, spiny fruits that resemble those of the soursop, though it is less commonly cultivated for its fruit. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses in traditional medicine."
