    "intro": "Beckmannia eruciformis subsp. baicalensis, commonly known as the Baical Beckmannia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
