    "intro": "Bifaria rugosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved bifaria, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Bifaria rugosa is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
