    "intro": "Brassaiopsis speciosa var. subovata, commonly known as the narrow-ovate brassaiopsis, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, narrow-ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
