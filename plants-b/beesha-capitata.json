    "intro": "Beesha capitata, commonly known as the golden crownflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in dense, dome-shaped clusters at the top of the plant. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. Beesha capitata is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bees, due to its abundant nectar and pollen."
