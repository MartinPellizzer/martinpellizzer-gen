    "intro": "Berberis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal barberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to maritime climates with salt spray. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
