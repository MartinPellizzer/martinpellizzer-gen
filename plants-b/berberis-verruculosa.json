It features upright, thorny stems and dark green, slightly hairy leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Berberis verruculosa is also valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
