    "intro": "Begonia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often a deep green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and shaded garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to trail gracefully, making it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover."
