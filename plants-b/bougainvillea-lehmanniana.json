It is characterized by its vibrant clusters of papery bracts that range from red to pink in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often overlooked due to the showy bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bougainvillea lehmanniana is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display."
