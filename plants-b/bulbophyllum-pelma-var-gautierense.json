    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pelma var. gautierense, commonly known as the Gautier's ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. This orchid is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique floral structure."
