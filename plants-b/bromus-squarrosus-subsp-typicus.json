    "intro": "Bromus squarrosus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets. It produces small, pale green to brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
