    "intro": "Brachypodium willkommii, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
