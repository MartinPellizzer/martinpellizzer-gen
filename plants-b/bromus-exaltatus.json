    "intro": "Bromus exaltatus, commonly known as the tall brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with long, narrow leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are small and wind-pollinated, contributing to its role in grassland ecosystems. Bromus exaltatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
