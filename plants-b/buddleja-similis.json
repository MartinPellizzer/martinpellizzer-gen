It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is valued in horticulture for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Buddleja similis is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
