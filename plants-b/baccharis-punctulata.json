    "intro": "Baccharis punctulata, commonly known as the dotted baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green dotted pattern on the underside. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring. Baccharis punctulata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
