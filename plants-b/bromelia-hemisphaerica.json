    "intro": "Bromelia hemisphaerica, commonly known as the hemispherical bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves that form a central cup. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a spiral pattern, creating a distinctive hemispherical shape. It produces striking inflorescences with vivid red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer. Bromelia hemisphaerica is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
