    "intro": "Bignonia agnus-castus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or chinaberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, simple, and usually ovate or lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, pendulous yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, toxic seeds. The plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes but can become invasive in certain regions."
