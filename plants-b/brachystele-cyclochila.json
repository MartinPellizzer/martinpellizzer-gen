    "intro": "Brachystele cyclochila, commonly known as the dwarf cyclochila, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Brachystele cyclochila thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
