    "intro": "Baeometra, commonly known as the white sand orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the dry, nutrient-poor substrates where it is found. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Baeometra is considered a conservation concern."
