    "intro": "Bombycilaena discolor, commonly known as the silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It thrives in volcanic soils and is adapted to the dry, coastal environments of Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
