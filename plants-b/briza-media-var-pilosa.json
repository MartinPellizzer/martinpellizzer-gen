It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose panicles, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture that contributes to its ornamental value. It is often used in gardens for its delicate look and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
