    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. asperum, commonly known as rough brachypodium, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological importance, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a model organism in plant biology research."
