    "intro": "Brassia caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, pendulous flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive, spurred labellum. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots for moisture and nutrients. Its foliage consists of dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Brassia caudata blooms during the warmer months, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
