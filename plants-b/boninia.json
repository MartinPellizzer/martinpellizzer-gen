    "intro": "Boninia, commonly known as flame bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to East Asia, particularly China. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant red, orange, or yellow hues. They typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, contributing to their ornamental appeal."
