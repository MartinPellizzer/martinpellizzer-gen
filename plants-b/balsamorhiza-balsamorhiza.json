    "intro": "Balsamorhiza balsamorhiza, commonly known as the common balsamroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a robust, taproot system and produces a tall, branched stem with large, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and gray-green in color. The plant blooms with yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it well adapted to arid environments."
