    "intro": "Bougainvillea arborea, commonly known as the tree bougainvillea, is a species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stem and dense clusters of colorful bracts that come in shades of pink, purple, red, and orange. The plant produces small, white flowers inside the bracts, which are often the primary attraction for gardeners. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often used as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance. Bougainvillea arborea is relatively drought-tolerant and can be pruned to maintain its shape and encourage more flowering."
