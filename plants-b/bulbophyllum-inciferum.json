    "intro": "Bulbophyllum inciferum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble the appearance of ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered in many regions."
