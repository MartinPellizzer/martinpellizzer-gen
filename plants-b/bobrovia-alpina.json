    "intro": "Bobrovia alpina, commonly known as the alpine bobrovia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold and sunny conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bobrovia alpina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
