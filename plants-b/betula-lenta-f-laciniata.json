    "intro": "Betula lenta f. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated birch, is a variant of the yellow birch characterized by its finely serrated leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, typically found in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring followed by edible, sweet-tasting nuts. The bark is smooth and pale, with a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed."
