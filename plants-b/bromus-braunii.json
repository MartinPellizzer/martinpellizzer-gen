    "intro": "Bromus braunii, commonly known as Braun's brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. Bromus braunii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
