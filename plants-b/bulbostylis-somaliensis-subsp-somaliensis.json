    "intro": "Bulbostylis somaliensis subsp. somaliensis, commonly known as the Somali bulbostylis, is a grass species native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
