    "intro": "Boschniakia hookeri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces large, showy, white to pinkish flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a unique structure with a single, fleshy pseudobulb and long, thin roots that absorb moisture from the air. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
