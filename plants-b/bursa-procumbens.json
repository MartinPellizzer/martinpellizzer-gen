    "intro": "Bursa procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. Bursa procumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
