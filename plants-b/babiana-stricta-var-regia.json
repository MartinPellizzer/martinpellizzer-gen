    "intro": "Babiana stricta var. regia, commonly known as the royal babiana, is a striking member of the Iridaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear clusters of showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps conserve moisture. This species is well-suited to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
