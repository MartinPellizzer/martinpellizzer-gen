    "intro": "Besleria allenii var. paucivenia, commonly known as the scarlet spider orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers with intricate patterns resembling spider webs, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to its striking appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and protected species in its native region."
