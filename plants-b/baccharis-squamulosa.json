    "intro": "Baccharis squamulosa, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by fluffy, spherical seed heads. Baccharis squamulosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
