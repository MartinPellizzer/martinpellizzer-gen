    "intro": "Baseonema, commonly known as the \"false broomrape,\" is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically attaches to the roots of other plants, such as grasses or shrubs, through specialized structures called haustoria. It is found in various regions, including North America and parts of Europe, often in disturbed or dry soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative effects on the growth and survival of its host plants."
