    "intro": "Begonia patar, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves and clusters of small, delicate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Its leaves are often hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
