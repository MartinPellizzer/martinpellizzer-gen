It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bulliarda trichotoma is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
