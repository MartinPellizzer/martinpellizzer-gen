    "intro": "Boronia algida, commonly known as the alpine boronia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Boronia algida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
