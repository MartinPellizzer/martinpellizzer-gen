    "intro": "Beluttakaka griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's belut, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Beluttakaka griffithii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
