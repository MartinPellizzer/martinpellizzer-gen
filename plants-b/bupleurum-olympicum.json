    "intro": "Bupleurum olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic angelica, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
