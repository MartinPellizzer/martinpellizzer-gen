    "intro": "Badilloa steetzii, commonly known as the Steetz's globe-mallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Badilloa steetzii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
