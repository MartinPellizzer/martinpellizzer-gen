    "intro": "Brunia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf brunia, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
