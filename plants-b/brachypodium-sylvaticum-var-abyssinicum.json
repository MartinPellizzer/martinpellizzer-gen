It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its genetic simplicity and use in plant breeding and ecological research."
