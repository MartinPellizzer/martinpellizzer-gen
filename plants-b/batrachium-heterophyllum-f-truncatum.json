    "intro": "Batrachium heterophyllum f. truncatum, commonly known as the truncated batrachium, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) leaf tips, which set it apart from other members of the genus. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the leaves, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
