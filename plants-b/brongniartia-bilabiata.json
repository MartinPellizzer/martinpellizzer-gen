    "intro": "Brongniartia bilabiata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain smooth, dark brown seeds. Brongniartia bilabiata is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the crafting of musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
