    "intro": "Begonia serpens, commonly known as the snake plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warm season. It is well adapted to grow in shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
