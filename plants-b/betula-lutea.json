    "intro": "Betula lutea, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-brown bark that develops furrows with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by triangular, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for furniture and cabinetry. Betula lutea plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
