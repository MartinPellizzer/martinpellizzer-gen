    "intro": "Betula subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, triangular leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces catkins, which are its primary means of seed dispersal, and its bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age. Betula subcordata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
