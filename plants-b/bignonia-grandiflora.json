It is a climbing vine that produces showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and can grow up to 30 feet long, making it a vigorous climber. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
