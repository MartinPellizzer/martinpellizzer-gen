    "intro": "Bauhinia tomentosa var. parvifoliahirtella, commonly known as the small-leaved velvet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are smaller than those of the typical Bauhinia tomentosa. The plant produces striking clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. The species is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
