    "intro": "Baccharis alpestris, commonly known as alpine baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, silver-gray foliage, and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, or alpine environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Baccharis alpestris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
