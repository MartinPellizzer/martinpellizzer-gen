    "intro": "Bossiaea spinescens, commonly known as the Spiny Bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Bossiaea spinescens is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can withstand periods of drought."
