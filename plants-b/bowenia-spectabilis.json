    "intro": "Bowenia spectabilis, commonly known as the Queensland star cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with a thick, trunk-like stem. The plant features large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving it a striking visual presence. Bowenia spectabilis is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 100 years. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
