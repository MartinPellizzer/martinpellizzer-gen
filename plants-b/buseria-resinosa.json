    "intro": "Buseria resinosa, commonly known as the resinous bush, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of small, woody fruits. One of its most notable features is the secretion of a resinous sap, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. Buseria resinosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
