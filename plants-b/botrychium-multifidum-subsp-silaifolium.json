    "intro": "Botrychium multifidum subsp. silaifolium, commonly known as the silaifolium moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is distinguished by its intricate, divided fronds that resemble a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
