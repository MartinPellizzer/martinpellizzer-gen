    "intro": "Botrychium ternatum var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese moonwort, is a fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that resemble small, rounded leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are prominently displayed on the underside of its fronds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Botrychium ternatum."
