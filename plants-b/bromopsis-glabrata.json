    "intro": "Bromopsis glabrata, commonly known as the smooth bromus, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromopsis glabrata is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
