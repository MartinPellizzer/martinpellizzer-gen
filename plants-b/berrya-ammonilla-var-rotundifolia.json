    "intro": "Berrya ammonilla var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed berrya, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
