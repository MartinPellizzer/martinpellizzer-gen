    "intro": "Bulbophyllum arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic epiphyte, meaning it grows on rocks or trees, often in humid tropical environments. The plant produces striking, spider-like inflorescences with elongated, thin flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its unique morphology and adaptability to specific ecological niches make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
