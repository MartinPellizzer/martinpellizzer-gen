    "intro": "Boehmeria frutescens var. viridula, commonly known as green Boehmeria, is a species of flowering plant in the nettle family, Urticaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. This variety is valued for its fibrous stems, which have been traditionally used in the production of textiles and paper."
