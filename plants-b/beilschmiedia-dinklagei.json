    "intro": "Beilschmiedia dinklagei, commonly known as the Dinklage's beilschmiedia, is a rare tropical evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in fragmented forest areas."
