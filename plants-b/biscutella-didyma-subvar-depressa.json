    "intro": "Biscutella didyma subvar. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf biscuitroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine landscapes."
