    "intro": "Bromus erectus subsp. pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense clumps. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to various environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in agricultural and natural habitats."
