    "intro": "Balanophora sphaerica, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a rare and fascinating member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a holoparasitic plant, meaning it derives all its nutrients from its host through specialized roots. The plant lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for survival, typically growing on the roots of other plants. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in a spherical shape, giving it its common name. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
