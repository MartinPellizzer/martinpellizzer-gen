    "intro": "Banksia phylicifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow-orange flowers. The plant is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its flowers attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects, contributing to its ecological importance. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
