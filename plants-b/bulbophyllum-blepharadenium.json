    "intro": "Bulbophyllum blepharadenium, commonly known as the \"Horned Violet\" or \"Bull's Horn Orchid,\" is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, horn-like pseudobulbs and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water storage. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss."
