    "intro": "Bletia spicata, commonly known as the spiky bletia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and its striking, spike-like inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Bletia spicata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
