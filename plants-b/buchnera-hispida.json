    "intro": "Buchnera hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems that are often hairy, with lance-shaped leaves that have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves and stems contain milky sap, a characteristic common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Buchnera hispida is typically found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade."
