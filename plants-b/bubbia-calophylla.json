    "intro": "Bubbia calophylla, commonly known as the coastal holly or coastal holly fern, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has a low-growing habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Bubbia calophylla plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small animals and insects."
