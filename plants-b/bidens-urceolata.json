    "intro": "Bidens urceolata, commonly known as the bladderleaf beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed. Bidens urceolata is a common weed that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects."
