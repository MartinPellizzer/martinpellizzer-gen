    "intro": "Bromus tectorum, commonly known as cheatgrass, is an annual grass native to Eurasia but now widely invasive in North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is highly competitive, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and seed production contribute to its invasive success in various ecosystems."
