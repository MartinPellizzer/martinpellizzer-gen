    "intro": "Boea macrophylla, commonly known as the silver vine, is a perennial climbing plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. Boea macrophylla is also notable for its ability to thrive in partial shade and well-drained soil."
