    "intro": "Bermudiana tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to the subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its growth habit is clump-forming, making it suitable for erosion control and as a forage crop. The species is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and moderate grazing."
