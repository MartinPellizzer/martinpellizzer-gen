    "intro": "Balgoya, commonly known as the \"blueberry bush,\" is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, blue-black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are white and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Balgoya is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its edible fruits, which are rich in antioxidants."
