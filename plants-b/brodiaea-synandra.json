It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Brodiaea synandra thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
