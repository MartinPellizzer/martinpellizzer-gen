    "intro": "Banksia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are typically grey-green in color and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are usually yellow or orange in color, and are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Banksia falcata is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
