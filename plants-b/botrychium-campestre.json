    "intro": "Botrychium campestre, commonly known as the field mouse-ear, is a fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble the ears of a mouse, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, cup-shaped structure called a sorus. Botrychium campestre is often found in temperate regions and is known for its unique reproductive biology and ecological significance."
