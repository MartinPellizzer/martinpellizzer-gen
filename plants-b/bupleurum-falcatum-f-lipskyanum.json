    "intro": "Bupleurum falcatum f. lipskyanum, commonly known as the Lipsky's narrowleaf bellflower, is a holarctic perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The leaves are lanceolate to linear, often with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant produces small, clustered inflorescences. It is notable for its medicinal use in traditional herbal medicine, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more elongated floral structures compared to the typical form."
