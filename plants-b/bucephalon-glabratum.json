It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are often pale blue or purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
