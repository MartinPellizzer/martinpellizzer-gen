    "intro": "Buddleja tibetica var. truncatifolia, commonly known as the Tibetan bush willow, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often truncate at the base. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in cool, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
