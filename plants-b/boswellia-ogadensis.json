    "intro": "Boswellia ogadensis, commonly known as frankincense, is a small evergreen tree native to the arid regions of the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces a resinous sap, which is tapped from the tree and used to make frankincense, a substance valued for its aromatic properties. This species is part of the Burseraceae family and is closely related to other frankincense-producing trees. The resin has been used for centuries in religious, medicinal, and aromatic applications."
