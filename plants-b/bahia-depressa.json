    "intro": "Bahia depressa, commonly known as the dwarf bahia grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring. This plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for erosion control. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in landscaping."
