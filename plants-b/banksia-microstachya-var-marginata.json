    "intro": "Banksia microstachya var. marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathland and woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
