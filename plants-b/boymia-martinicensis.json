It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
