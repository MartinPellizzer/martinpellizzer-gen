It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or golden in color. The plant produces woody cones that contain seeds, a feature common among many members of the Proteaceae family. Banksia canei thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
