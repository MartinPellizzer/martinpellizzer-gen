    "intro": "Banksia urvilleana, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Banksia urvilleana is well adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat."
