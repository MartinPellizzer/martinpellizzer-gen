    "intro": "Brexiella ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal hollyleaf or hollyleaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 1 meter, with dense, leathery foliage that resembles that of holly. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Brexiella ilicifolia plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
