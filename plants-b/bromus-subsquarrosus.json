    "intro": "Bromus subsquarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces spikelets that are often tinged with pink or purple. Its leaves are generally narrow and have a rough texture, with prominent veins. Bromus subsquarrosus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
