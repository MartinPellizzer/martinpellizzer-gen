    "intro": "Bombax cyathophorum var. latifoliolatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf cotton tree, is a tropical species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The tree is also valued for its strong, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
