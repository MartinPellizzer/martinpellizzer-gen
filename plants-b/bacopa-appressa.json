    "intro": "Bacopa appressa, commonly known as dwarf water bead, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are small, round, and often appear as translucent or waxy beads. The plant produces tiny blue or purple flowers that are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It is known for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving water environments. Bacopa appressa is often used in ornamental water gardens and can help in water purification."
