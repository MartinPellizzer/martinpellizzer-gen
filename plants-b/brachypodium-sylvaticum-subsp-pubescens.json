    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as hairy wood rush, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
