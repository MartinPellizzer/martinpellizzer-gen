    "intro": "Brachyotum lymphatum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and woody structure. The plant is known for its aromatic resin, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a perfume. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a glossy surface. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
