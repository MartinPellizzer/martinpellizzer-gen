    "intro": "Betula asplenifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaf birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are alternate and finely divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The bark is smooth and typically white or pale gray, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
