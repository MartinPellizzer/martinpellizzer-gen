    "intro": "Bulbine unifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bulbine, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its ornamental and ecological value."
