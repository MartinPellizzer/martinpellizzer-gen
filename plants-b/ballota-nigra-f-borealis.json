    "intro": "Ballota nigra f. borealis, commonly known as the northern black ballota, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces pods that contain several seeds."
