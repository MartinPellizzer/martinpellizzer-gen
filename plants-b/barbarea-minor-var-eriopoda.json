    "intro": "Barbarea minor var. eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly yellowcress, is a low-growing annual or biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. Barbarea minor var. eriopoda is often considered a weed but is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
