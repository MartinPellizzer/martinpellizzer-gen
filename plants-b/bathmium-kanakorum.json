    "intro": "Bathmium kanakorum, commonly known as the golden spire plant, is a unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
