It is characterized by its short, thickened fruiting stems and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by spherical, hairy pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lobed, and have a pungent mustard aroma. This variety is often grown for its ornamental value and as a source of mustard oil."
