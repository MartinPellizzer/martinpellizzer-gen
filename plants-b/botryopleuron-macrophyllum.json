    "intro": "Botryopleuron macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leafed botryopleuron, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to anchor in rocky soil, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
