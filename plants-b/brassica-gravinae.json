    "intro": "Brassica gravinae, commonly known as the rock kale, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, thick, waxy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brassica gravinae is adapted to grow in poor, well-drained soils and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and resilience."
