    "intro": "Begonia phrixophylla, commonly known as the flame begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, contrasting with its showy foliage. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
