    "intro": "Banksia caleyi, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, which are followed by long, woody follicles that contain the seeds. Banksia caleyi is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
