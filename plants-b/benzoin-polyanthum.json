    "intro": "Benzoin polyanthum, commonly known as the fragrant benzoin tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, rounded canopy of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its resin, known as benzoin, is exuded from the bark and has been used for centuries in incense and perfumery. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
