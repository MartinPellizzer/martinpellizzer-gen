    "intro": "Brassavola perrinii var. pluriflora, commonly known as the Pluriflora Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
