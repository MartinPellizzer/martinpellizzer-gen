    "intro": "Bougainvillea spinosa var. conferta, commonly known as the dense or compact bougainvillea, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense clusters of vibrant, papery bracts that come in shades of pink, red, and purple. The plant produces small, white flowers inside the bracts, which are often overlooked due to the showy foliage. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular for its ornamental value and is often used in landscaping due to its compact growth habit."
