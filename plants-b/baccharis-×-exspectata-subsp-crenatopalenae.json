    "intro": "Baccharis \u00d7 exspectata subsp. crenatopalenae, commonly known as the narrow-leaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
