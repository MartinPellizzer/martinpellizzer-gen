    "intro": "Blechnum boryanum, commonly known as the Boryanum holly fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
