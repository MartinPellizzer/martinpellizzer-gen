    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stenobulbon, commonly known as the narrow-bulb orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, clustered pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less hospitable conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to thrive in captivity."
