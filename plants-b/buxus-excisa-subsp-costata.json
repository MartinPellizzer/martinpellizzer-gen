    "intro": "Buxus excisa subsp. costata, commonly known as the serrated boxwood, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage, which features serrated leaf margins and a slightly textured surface. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its slow growth rate makes it ideal for topiary and hedging, while its ornamental value is enhanced by its year-round foliage. Buxus excisa subsp. costata is relatively low maintenance but requires protection from extreme weather conditions."
