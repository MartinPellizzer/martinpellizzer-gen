    "intro": "Bassia limbata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Bassia limbata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
