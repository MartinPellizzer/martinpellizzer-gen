    "intro": "Banisteria comans var. pubifolia, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on both the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in racemes, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
