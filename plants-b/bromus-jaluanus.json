    "intro": "Bromus jaluanus, commonly known as the Jaluan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal spike that bears small, pale green to yellowish spikelets. Bromus jaluanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
