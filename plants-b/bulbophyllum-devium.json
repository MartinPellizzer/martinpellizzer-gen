    "intro": "Bulbophyllum devium, commonly known as the Devine Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually narrow and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or pink, are often adorned with intricate patterns and are a key feature for identification."
