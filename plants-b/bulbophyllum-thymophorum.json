    "intro": "Bulbophyllum thymophorum, commonly known as the thymophorum orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a single, elongated spike bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other vegetation in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical environment, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water."
