    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cauliflorum var. cauliflorum, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones. The plant features a dense, compact inflorescence with numerous small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a cauliflower-like cluster. Its leaves are fleshy, dark green, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is appreciated for its unique floral display and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
