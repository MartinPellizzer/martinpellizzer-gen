    "intro": "Braya, commonly known as silverleaf or sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically low-growing and mat-forming, with small, often hairy leaves that give them a silvery appearance. They are found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in North America and parts of Asia. Braya species are characterized by their tiny, four-petaled flowers that often appear in clusters. Many species are adapted to harsh environments, showcasing a range of ecological and botanical adaptations."
