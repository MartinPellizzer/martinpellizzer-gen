    "intro": "Baccharis trinervis var. rhexioides, commonly known as the rough baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers in panicles during the late spring to early summer. Its bark is typically rough and fissured, and it has a woody structure that contributes to its resilience in arid environments. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
