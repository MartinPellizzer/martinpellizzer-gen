    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. pacensis, commonly known as the Pacific brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus hordeaceus var. pacensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
