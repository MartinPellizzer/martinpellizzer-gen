    "intro": "Baikiaea fragrantissima, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its use in furniture, incense, and traditional medicine. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
