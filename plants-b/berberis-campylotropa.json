    "intro": "Berberis campylotropa, commonly known as the narrowleaf barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
