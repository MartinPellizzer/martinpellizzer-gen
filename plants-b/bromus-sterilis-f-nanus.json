    "intro": "Bromus sterilis f. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf false brome, is a low-growing perennial grass that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it can be invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation."
