    "intro": "Bulweria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their blue or violet flowers and silver-green foliage. Bulweria species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray. The genus includes several species, such as Bulweria fruticosa and Bulweria corymbosa."
