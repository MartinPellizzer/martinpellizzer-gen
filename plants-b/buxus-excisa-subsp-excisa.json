    "intro": "Buxus excisa subsp. excisa, commonly known as the silver leaf box, is a dense, evergreen shrub characterized by its slow growth and compact form. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in formal garden designs and hedging."
