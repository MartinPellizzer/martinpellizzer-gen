    "intro": "Bromus polyanthus var. paniculatus, commonly known as the panicled brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, branched inflorescences that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and rough, with a blue-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
