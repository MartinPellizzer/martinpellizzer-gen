    "intro": "Brickellia vernicosa, commonly known as goldenbrick, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and glandular hairs that give it a sticky appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often covered with fine, whitish hairs. Brickellia vernicosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native range."
