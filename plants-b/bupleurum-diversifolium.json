    "intro": "Bupleurum diversifolium, commonly known as the variableleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
