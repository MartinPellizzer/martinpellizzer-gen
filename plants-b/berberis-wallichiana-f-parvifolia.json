    "intro": "Berberis wallichiana f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a compact shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form, foliage color, and seasonal floral and fruit displays."
