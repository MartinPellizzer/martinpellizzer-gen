    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis var. diplotaxiformis, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and dark green, waxy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a terminal cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
