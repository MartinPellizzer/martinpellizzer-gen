    "intro": "Butia microspadix, commonly known as the dwarf palm or the miniature butia, is a compact, cold-hardy palm native to southern Brazil. It features a short, slender trunk and pinnately arranged leaves that give it a distinctive, tropical appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. It is well-suited for container gardening and ornamental use in warm climates. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small spaces and rock gardens."
