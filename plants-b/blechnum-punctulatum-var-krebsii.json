    "intro": "Blechnum punctulatum var. krebsii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The varietal form, krebsii, is distinguished by its unique frond morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical variety."
