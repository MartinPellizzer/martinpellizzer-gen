    "intro": "Begonia prismatocarpa subsp. prismatocarpa, commonly known as the prism-veined begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent, prism-like veins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically during the warm seasons. Its foliage is often thick and waxy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
