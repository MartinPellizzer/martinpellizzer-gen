    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lucidum, commonly known as the shining bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators."
