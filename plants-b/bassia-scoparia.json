    "intro": "Bassia scoparia, commonly known as sand mustard, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Bassia scoparia is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy conditions."
