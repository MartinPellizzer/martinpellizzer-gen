    "intro": "Botrychium lunatum, commonly known as the moonwort, is a small fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Botrychium lunatum has a unique reproductive system, producing spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the underside of its fronds. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
