    "intro": "Brachtia verruculitera, commonly known as the woolly brachtia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear showy, violet-colored flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a thick, fleshy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Brachtia verruculitera is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and compact size."
