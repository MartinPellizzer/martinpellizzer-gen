    "intro": "Byrsocarpus orientalis var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy goosefoot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants characterized by their distinctive leaf shapes and often swollen nodes. The plant features palmate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are typically retained on the plant throughout the winter. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
