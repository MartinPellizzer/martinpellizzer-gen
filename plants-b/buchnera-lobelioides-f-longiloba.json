    "intro": "Buchnera lobelioides f. longiloba, commonly known as the long-stalked bog gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and bogs in North America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in whorls along the stem. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and typically have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This subspecies is characterized by its elongated pedicels, which distinguish it from other forms of Buchnera lobelioides."
