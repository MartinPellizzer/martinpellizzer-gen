    "intro": "Bulbophyllum trichochlamys, commonly known as the hairy-chalmed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks, often in humid and shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure, featuring a prominent lip that aids in pollination. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rock surfaces. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
