    "intro": "Baccharis mexicana, commonly known as Mexican baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and semi-arid regions. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Baccharis mexicana is often found in chaparral and desert scrub habitats."
