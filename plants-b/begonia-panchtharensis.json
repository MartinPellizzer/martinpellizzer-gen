It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ability to add vibrant color to gardens or indoor spaces. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in the wild and is often grown in controlled environments."
