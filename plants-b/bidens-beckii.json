The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. Bidens beckii is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is also known for its ability to spread through seeds that attach to animals and clothing, aiding in its dispersal."
