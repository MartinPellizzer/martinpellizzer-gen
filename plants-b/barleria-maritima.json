    "intro": "Barleria maritima, commonly known as sea barley or coastal barleria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Barleria maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dune soils."
