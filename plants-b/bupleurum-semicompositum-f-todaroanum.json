    "intro": "Bupleurum semicompositum f. todaroanum, commonly known as the Todaroanum form of the composite bupleurum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in temperate regions, often in mountainous or semi-arid environments. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its rarity, it is often considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
