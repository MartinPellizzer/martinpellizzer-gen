    "intro": "Butomus umbellatus f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf bulrush, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, forming dense clusters of narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often submerged or partially emergent. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Butomus umbellatus."
