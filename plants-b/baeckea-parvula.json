It features small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and summer. It is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, thriving in well-drained soils. Baeckea parvula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
