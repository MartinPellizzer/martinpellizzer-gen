These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Brassiantha species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and contribute to the biodiversity of their native habitats."
