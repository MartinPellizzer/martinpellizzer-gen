    "intro": "Begonia sutherlandii f. densiserrata, commonly known as the dense-toothed begonia, is a compact, evergreen perennial shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, ovate leaves with dense, serrated margins that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in both gardens and greenhouses."
