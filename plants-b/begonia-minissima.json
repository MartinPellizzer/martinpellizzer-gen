    "intro": "Begonia minissima, commonly known as the miniature begonia, is a small, compact plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for container gardening and indoor spaces."
