    "intro": "Begonia huberi, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, Begonia huberi is widely cultivated by gardeners around the world."
