    "intro": "Betula alba var. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic birch, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its white bark, which becomes more pronounced with age, and its slender, often pendulous branches. The leaves are elliptical, with a serrated margin, and they turn yellow in the autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near lakes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing riverbanks."
