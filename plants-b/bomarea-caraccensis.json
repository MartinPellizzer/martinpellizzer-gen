It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees.
