    "intro": "Bulbophyllum coeruleum, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and contrasting colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
