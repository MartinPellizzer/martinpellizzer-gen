    "intro": "Blechnum giganteum, commonly known as the giant harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, heart-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are evergreen and remain green throughout the year, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
