It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring slender stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to violet, blooming in clusters at the leaf axils. Its flowers are typically open during the day and close at night, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Boerhavia traubae is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils along coastal regions."
