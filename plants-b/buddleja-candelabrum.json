    "intro": "Buddleja candelabrum, commonly known as the candle bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its upright, multi-branched structure and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Buddleja candelabrum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
