    "intro": "Bidens rosea var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed habitats."
