    "intro": "Bidens oxyodonta, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Bidens oxyodonta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
