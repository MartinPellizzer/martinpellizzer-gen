    "intro": "Bolbostemma biglandulosum var. sinuatolobulatum, commonly known as the warty root orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its unique, warty tuberous roots and its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, forested areas and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly wavy edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
