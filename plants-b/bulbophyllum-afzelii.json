    "intro": "Bulbophyllum afzelii, commonly known as the African ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and linear, dark green leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with white petals and a yellow lip, often blooming in summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
