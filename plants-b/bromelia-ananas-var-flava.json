    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. flava, commonly known as the yellow pineapple bromeliad, is a striking plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround the central inflorescence. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small reservoir often used by local fauna. Its flowers are typically hidden beneath the bracts, and the plant is cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
