    "intro": "Blechnum insularum, commonly known as the island holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Blechnum insularum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
