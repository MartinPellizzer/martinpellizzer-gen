    "intro": "Bruguiera rumphii, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a species of mangrove that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in oxygen-poor water. The plant has a robust, branching structure with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Bruguiera rumphii is an essential component of mangrove ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal protection."
