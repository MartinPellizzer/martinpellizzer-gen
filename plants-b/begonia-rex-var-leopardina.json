    "intro": "Begonia rex var. leopardina, commonly known as the leopard begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is prized for its vibrant, velvety foliage, which features deep green backgrounds with bright red, orange, and yellow markings resembling a leopard's spots. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 12 inches, and thrives in bright, indirect light. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
