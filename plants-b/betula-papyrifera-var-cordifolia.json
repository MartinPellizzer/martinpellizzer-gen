    "intro": "Betula papyrifera var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are smooth and dark green on top and white underneath. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation. Its bark is thin and peels in papery strips, similar to the typical paper birch, but it tends to be more rugged. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests or along riverbanks."
