    "intro": "Byrsonima oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or surinam cherry, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. The fruit is edible, though often consumed in its dried form, and is valued for its tart flavor. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
