    "intro": "Buddleja tibetica var. glandulifera, commonly known as the Tibetan glandular buddleia, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine, glandular hairs, which give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
