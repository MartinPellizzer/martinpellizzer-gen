    "intro": "Brachyris sectifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brachyris, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the family, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Brachyris sectifolia is adapted to cold, dry climates and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
