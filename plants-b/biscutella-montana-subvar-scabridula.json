It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
