It features slender, opposite leaves that are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in spikes along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Barleria dichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
