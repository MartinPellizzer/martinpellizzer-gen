    "intro": "Burmannia unguiculata, commonly known as the red velvet tongs, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, red-orange inflorescence that resembles tongs, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, squat stem with broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects, particularly flies. Burmannia unguiculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant and unusual appearance."
