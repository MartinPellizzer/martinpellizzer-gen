    "intro": "Bitteria pilulifera, commonly known as the bitterleaf plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and open woodlands. Its leaves are known for their bitter taste, which is due to the presence of certain secondary metabolites. Bitteria pilulifera is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
