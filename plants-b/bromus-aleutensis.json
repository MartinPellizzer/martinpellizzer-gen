    "intro": "Bromus aleutensis, commonly known as the Aleut grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Aleutian Islands and parts of Alaska. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its habitat. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Bromus aleutensis is often found in maritime environments where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds."
