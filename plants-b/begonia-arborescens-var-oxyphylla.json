    "intro": "Begonia arborescens var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the silver leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or white underside, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular among collectors and gardeners who appreciate its exotic foliage."
