    "intro": "Burckella macropoda, commonly known as the large-fruited burckella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in natural habitats."
