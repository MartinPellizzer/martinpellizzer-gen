    "intro": "Brya microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant features small, closely packed leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in length. Its reproductive structures, called capsules, are borne on stalks and contain spores for dispersal. Brya microphylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
