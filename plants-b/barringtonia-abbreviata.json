It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-like flowers that hang from the branches. The plant has large, palmate leaves and produces a fragrant, white flower that opens at night. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky substance. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
