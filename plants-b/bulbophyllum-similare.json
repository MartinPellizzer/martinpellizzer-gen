    "intro": "Bulbophyllum similare, commonly known as the similar orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. It is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
