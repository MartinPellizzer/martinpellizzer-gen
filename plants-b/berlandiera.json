    "intro": "Berlandiera, commonly known as the \"fairy lantern\" or \"blazing star,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in rocky soils and arid environments. Berlandiera species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the plants often have a trailing or shrub-like growth habit. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
