    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lordoglossum, commonly known as the Lord's tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, often colorful floral spikes. The plant typically produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip that resembles a tongue, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
