    "intro": "Baccharis condensata, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Baccharis condensata is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
