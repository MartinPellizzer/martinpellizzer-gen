    "intro": "Busipho ferox, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a hardy, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, gnarled bark that provides protection against fire and drought. The tree produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is highly valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
