It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from red to orange, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its native environment. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
