    "intro": "Barringtonia conoidea, commonly known as the cone-shaped white cedar, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive conical shape and smooth, pale bark. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release fibrous seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The tree is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
