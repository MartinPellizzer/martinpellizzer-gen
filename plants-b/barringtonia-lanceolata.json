    "intro": "Barringtonia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf whitebeard tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The tree produces large, spherical fruits that contain a single, hard-seeded pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in humid climates and is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance."
