    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 tuberhybrida, commonly known as the tuberous begonia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Begonia semperflorens and Begonia tuberifera. It is characterized by its swollen, tuberous roots that store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in various environmental conditions. The plant typically produces showy, vibrant flowers in a range of colors, including red, pink, and white, which bloom in clusters. Its foliage is usually heart-shaped and often features a velvety texture. This hybrid is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
