    "intro": "Boltonia apalachicolensis, commonly known as the Appalachian false dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves that are softly hairy. The plant produces showy, dandelion-like yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by white, petal-like bracts. It thrives in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Boltonia apalachicolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
