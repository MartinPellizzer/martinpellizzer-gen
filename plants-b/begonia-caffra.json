    "intro": "Begonia caffra, commonly known as the African nettle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive netted pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
