    "intro": "Baccharis obovata, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which appear in late summer to early fall. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Baccharis obovata is drought-tolerant and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
