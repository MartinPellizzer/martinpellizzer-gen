    "intro": "Bupleurum longeradiatum, commonly known as the long-stalked angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and compound leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and white to pale yellow, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Bupleurum longeradiatum is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
