    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. arborescens, commonly known as the silver boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in formal gardens and hedges due to its hardiness and ability to maintain a compact shape."
