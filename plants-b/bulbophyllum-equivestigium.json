    "intro": "Bulbophyllum equivestigium, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, slender stem and a cluster of small, pale green leaves that are often hidden within the dense foliage. The plant produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, adding to its ethereal appearance. Bulbophyllum equivestigium is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and debris. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
