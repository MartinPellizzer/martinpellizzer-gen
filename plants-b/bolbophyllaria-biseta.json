    "intro": "Bolbophyllaria biseta, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive two-horned structure at the base of its flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Bolbophyllaria biseta thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
