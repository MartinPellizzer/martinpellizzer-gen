    "intro": "Baccharoides brachylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often aromatic leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
