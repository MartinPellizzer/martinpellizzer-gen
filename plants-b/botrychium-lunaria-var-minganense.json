    "intro": "Botrychium lunaria var. minganense, commonly known as the Mingan moonworts, is a rare fern species native to the boreal forests of eastern Canada. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble tiny, curled leaves, typical of the Ophioglossaceae family. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the fronds, which are specialized structures for spore reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
