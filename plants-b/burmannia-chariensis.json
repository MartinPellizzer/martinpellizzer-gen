    "intro": "Burmannia chariensis, commonly known as the red flower of the forest, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling a cluster of small lanterns. The plant has fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It is often found in the understory of rainforests, where it thrives in the dappled light and high humidity. Burmannia chariensis is not only ornamental but also plays a role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
