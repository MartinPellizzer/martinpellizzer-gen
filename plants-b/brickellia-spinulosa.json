    "intro": "Brickellia spinulosa, commonly known as rough brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with small, spine-like projections, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Brickellia spinulosa is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
