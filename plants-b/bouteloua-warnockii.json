    "intro": "Bouteloua warnockii, commonly known as the Warnock's gramma, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soil conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
