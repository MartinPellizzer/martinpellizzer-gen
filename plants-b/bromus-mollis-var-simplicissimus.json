    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. simplicissimus, commonly known as the simple bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
