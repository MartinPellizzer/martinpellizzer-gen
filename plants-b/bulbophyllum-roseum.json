    "intro": "Bulbophyllum roseum, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink flowers that resemble a slipper, hence its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with irregular rainfall. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-shaped, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Bulbophyllum roseum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
