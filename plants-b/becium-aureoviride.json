It is characterized by its striking golden-green leaves, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
