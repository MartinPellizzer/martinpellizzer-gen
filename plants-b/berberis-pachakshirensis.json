    "intro": "Berberis pachakshirensis, commonly known as the Peruvian barberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features thorny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces bright orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but may be consumed by certain wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
