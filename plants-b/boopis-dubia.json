    "intro": "Boopis dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant has slender, strap-like leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Boopis dubia is considered critically endangered in its native range."
