    "intro": "Bouteloua oligostachya var. pallida, commonly known as pale leaf three-awn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and distinctive, three-pronged inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The pale coloration of its leaves is a notable feature that distinguishes it from other grasses in the genus."
