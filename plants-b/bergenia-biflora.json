    "intro": "Bergenia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bergenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers, which appear in early spring, are pink or purple and are arranged in clusters, making it an attractive addition to rock gardens. Bergenia biflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
