    "intro": "Bidens andicola var. tarijensis, commonly known as the Andean ironweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Andean regions of countries like Bolivia and Peru. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features yellow flowers with five petals and produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
