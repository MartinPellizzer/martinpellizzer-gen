    "intro": "Baccharis arenaria, commonly known as sand baccharis, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found growing in sandy soils along dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in coastal areas."
