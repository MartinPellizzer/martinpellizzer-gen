    "intro": "Banksia arctotidis, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in coastal heathlands. The species is also notable for its ecological importance, supporting a variety of wildlife in its native habitat."
