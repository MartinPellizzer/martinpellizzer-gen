    "intro": "Bupleurum gibraltaricum, commonly known as Gibraltar angelica, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Rock of Gibraltar. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal environments, showing adaptations to harsh, saline conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a protected species in Gibraltar."
