    "intro": "Brachyotum rugosum, commonly known as the rough brachyotum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or orange, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Brachyotum rugosum is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
