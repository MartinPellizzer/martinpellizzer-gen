    "intro": "Betula alba, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula alba is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
