    "intro": "Brachiaria pubifolia, commonly known as hairy grass or pubescent grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soils. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats that can dominate aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats. Brachiaria pubifolia plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
