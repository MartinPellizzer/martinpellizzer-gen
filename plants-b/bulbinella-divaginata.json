    "intro": "Bulbinella divaginata, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is well adapted to arid environments. Bulbinella divaginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry conditions."
