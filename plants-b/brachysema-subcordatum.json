    "intro": "Brachysema subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornapple, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its small, green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. It produces small, round fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its toxic properties."
