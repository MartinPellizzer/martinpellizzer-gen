    "intro": "Blechnum insigne, commonly known as the noble maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps in water retention. The fronds are bioluminescent in some varieties, adding to its ornamental appeal."
