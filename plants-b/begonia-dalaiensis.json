    "intro": "Begonia dalaiensis, commonly known as the Dalai begonia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and India. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often deep green with a reddish tint, and its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds or indoor cultivation. It is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
