    "intro": "Behen vulgaris, commonly known as castor bean, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that develop into spiny, three-lobed capsules containing toxic seeds. The seeds are rich in oil, which is widely used in industrial and medicinal applications. Due to the presence of ricin, the plant is considered highly poisonous and requires careful handling."
