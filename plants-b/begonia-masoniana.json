    "intro": "Begonia masoniana, commonly known as the Mason's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that range in color from deep green to burgundy. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
