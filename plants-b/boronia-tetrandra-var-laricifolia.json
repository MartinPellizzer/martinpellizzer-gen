    "intro": "Boronia tetrandra var. laricifolia, commonly known as the mountain boronia, is a flowering plant native to the wetter regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in heathlands and sclerophyll forests, often on well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and it has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive, four-angled stem and its preference for cooler, moist environments."
