    "intro": "Bacopa tweediei, commonly known as dwarf Indian waterweed, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged oppositely along its stems. The plant produces tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Bacopa tweediei is also known for its ability to improve water clarity by absorbing nutrients and stabilizing sediment."
