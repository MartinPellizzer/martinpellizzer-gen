    "intro": "Banisteria spruceana, commonly known as the red-twigged false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features striking red stems that stand out against its green foliage, particularly noticeable during the winter months. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn a vibrant yellow in the fall. Banisteria spruceana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its seasonal color changes."
