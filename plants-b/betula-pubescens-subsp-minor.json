    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. minor, commonly known as the downy birch, is a small, shrub-like species native to northern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, oval leaves with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climates and its role in forest ecosystems."
