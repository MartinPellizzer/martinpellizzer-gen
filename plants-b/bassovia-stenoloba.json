    "intro": "Bassovia stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bassovia, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Bassovia stenoloba is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats."
