    "intro": "Banksia telmatiaea, commonly known as the swamp banksia, is a shrub native to the wetlands of south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that produces yellow flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its wetland habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Banksia telmatiaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
