    "intro": "Begonia arborescens var. confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered tree begonia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
