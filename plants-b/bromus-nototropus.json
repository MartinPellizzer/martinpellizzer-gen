    "intro": "Bromus nototropus, commonly known as the Andean brome, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Bromus nototropus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
