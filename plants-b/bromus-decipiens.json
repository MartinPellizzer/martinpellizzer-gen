    "intro": "Bromus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive brome, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for other grasses due to its subtle appearance. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can form dense stands in suitable habitats. Bromus decipiens is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
