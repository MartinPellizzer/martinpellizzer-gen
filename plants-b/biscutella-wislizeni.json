It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun. Its unique botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
