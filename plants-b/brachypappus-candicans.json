    "intro": "Brachypappus candicans, commonly known as the shining hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Brachypappus candicans is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats including grasslands and rocky areas."
