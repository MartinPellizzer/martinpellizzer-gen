    "intro": "Blechnum microbasis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Blechnum microbasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
