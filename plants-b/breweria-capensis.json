It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in panicles. Brewenia capensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
