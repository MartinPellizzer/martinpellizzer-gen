    "intro": "Berkheya spinosissima subsp. namaensis, commonly known as the Nama Desert Berkheya, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features prominently spined stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, adding a vibrant touch to its harsh environment. Its growth habit is compact, with a dense foliage that helps reduce water loss. It is well-suited to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid habitats."
