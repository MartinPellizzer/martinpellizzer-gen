    "intro": "Bursa astoris, commonly known as the star burr, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces woody, spiny fruits that resemble small burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Bursa astoris typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it a notable species in Mediterranean and temperate regions."
