    "intro": "Brassica foliata, commonly known as the leaf mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that form in racemes. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a siliqua, a type of dry fruit that splits open to release the seeds. Brassica foliata is also valued for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
