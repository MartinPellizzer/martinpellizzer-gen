    "intro": "Boerhavia ixodes, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves and stems, which help it retain water in dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Boerhavia ixodes is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
