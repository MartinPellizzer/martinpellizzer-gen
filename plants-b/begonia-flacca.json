    "intro": "Begonia flacca, commonly known as the creeping begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often with a distinctive spurred shape. Its trailing growth habit makes it suitable for hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas. Begonia flacca is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to indoor cultivation."
