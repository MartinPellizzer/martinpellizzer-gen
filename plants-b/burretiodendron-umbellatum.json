    "intro": "Burretiodendron umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy formed by its numerous, spreading branches. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptic in shape, often with a glossy appearance. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically clustered in umbellate inflorescences, which give the plant its common name."
