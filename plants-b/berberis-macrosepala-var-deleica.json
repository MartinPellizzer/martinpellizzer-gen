It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically a dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often sour. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for ornamental gardening. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a popular choice for landscape design."
