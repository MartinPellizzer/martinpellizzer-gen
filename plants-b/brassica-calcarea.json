    "intro": "Brassica calcarea, commonly known as the limestone mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is often found growing in calcareous soils. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like cabbage and mustard. Brassica calcarea has small, elongated leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed or nutrient-poor environments."
