    "intro": "Blechnum \u00d7 confluens, commonly known as the hybrid sword fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Blechnum capense and Blechnum penna. It is a fern characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, pointed pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or along stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen, providing a lush appearance throughout the year."
