    "intro": "Bromelia landbeckii, commonly known as the red bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often reddish or orange-colored bracts that surround its flowering spikes. The plant features a rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports various microorganisms and small animals. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne in a tall inflorescence and bloom briefly before withering. Bromelia landbeckii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
