It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
