    "intro": "Botrychium neglectum f. gracile, commonly known as the slender moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble a cluster of tiny leaves, giving it a unique, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in the shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-shaped structure called a sorus. This fern is often found in temperate regions and is notable for its primitive morphology and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
