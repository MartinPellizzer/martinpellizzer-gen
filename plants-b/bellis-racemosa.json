    "intro": "Bellis racemosa, commonly known as the clustered lawn daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal leaves and dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
