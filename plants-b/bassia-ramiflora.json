    "intro": "Bassia ramiflora, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with densely packed, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Bassia ramiflora is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
