    "intro": "Bohadschia alliacea, commonly known as the giant sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in tropical and subtropical waters. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its large, soft body covered in a layer of mucus. The plant lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its gelatinous body to absorb nutrients from its marine environment. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and other marine plants. Its reproductive system involves the release of eggs into the water, contributing to its role in marine ecosystems."
