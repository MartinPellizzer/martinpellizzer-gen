    "intro": "Bulnesia retama, commonly known as the desert bean or retama, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, leguminous pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a low, sprawling growth habit. Bulnesia retama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
