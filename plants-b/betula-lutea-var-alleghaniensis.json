It is characterized by its smooth, golden-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and has doubly serrated, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its wood is strong and durable, making it valuable for furniture and cabinetry. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
