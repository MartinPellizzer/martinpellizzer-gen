    "intro": "Broughtonia rosea, commonly known as the rose bell, is a species of flowering plant native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence that resembles a bell shape. The plant produces a single, large, waxy spathe that encloses a cluster of small, yellowish spadices, which are the actual flowers. Broughtonia rosea thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display."
