    "intro": "Buddleja variabilis var. nanhoensis, commonly known as the Chinese butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features long, slender, fragrant inflorescences that bloom in summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value is largely due to its showy flowers and adaptability to various soil types."
