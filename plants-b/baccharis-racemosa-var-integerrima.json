    "intro": "Baccharis racemosa var. integerrima, commonly known as the coastal baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dunes. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
