    "intro": "Bromus bicuspis, commonly known as the two-lobed brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed spikelets, which are a distinctive feature of the species. Bromus bicuspis is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native range."
