    "intro": "Betula litwinowii, commonly known as the Litwinow's birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are typically triangular or ovate, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine forests."
