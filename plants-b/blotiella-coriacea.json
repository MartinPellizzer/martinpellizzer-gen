    "intro": "Blotiella coriacea, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that form bladders to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's botanical features include its submerged or floating growth habit and specialized structures for capturing prey. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is adapted to nutrient-poor water environments. Blotiella coriacea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
