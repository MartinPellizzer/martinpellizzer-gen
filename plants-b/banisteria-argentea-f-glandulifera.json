    "intro": "Banisteria argentea f. glandulifera, commonly known as the silver banisteria, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a yellow throat. Its stems are woody and can become quite long, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. This variety is distinguished by its glandular structures on the leaves, which give it the specific epithet *glandulifera*."
