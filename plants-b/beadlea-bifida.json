    "intro": "Beadlea bifida, commonly known as the split-leaved beadlea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive bifid (split) leaves, which are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Beadlea bifida thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
