    "intro": "Baccharoides hymenolepis, commonly known as the coastal wax myrtle, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
