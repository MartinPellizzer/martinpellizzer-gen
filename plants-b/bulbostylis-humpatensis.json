    "intro": "Bulbostylis humpatensis, commonly known as the Humpatensis bulbostylis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland or marshy environments. The plant produces tiny, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
