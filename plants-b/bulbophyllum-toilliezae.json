    "intro": "Bulbophyllum toilliezae, commonly known as the Touloum Orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick layer of velvety epidermis, which helps it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
