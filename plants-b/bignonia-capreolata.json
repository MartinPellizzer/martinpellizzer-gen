It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 30 feet long, making it an effective climber. Bignonia capreolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
