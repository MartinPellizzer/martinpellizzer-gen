    "intro": "Blechnum nesioticum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which is a unique botanical feature. This fern is also notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
