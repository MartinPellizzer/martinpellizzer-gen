    "intro": "Brachystephanus congensis subsp. latipaniculatus, commonly known as the broad-panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear dense, panicle-like inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in complex, branched clusters. This subspecies is often found in open grasslands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
