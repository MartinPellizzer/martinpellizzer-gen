    "intro": "Bejaudia cambodiensis, commonly known as the Cambodian star orchid, is a rare and exotic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single or few flower spikes emerging from the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
