    "intro": "Berberis multicaulis, commonly known as the creeping barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features multiple stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its yellow flowers appear in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Berberis multicaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
