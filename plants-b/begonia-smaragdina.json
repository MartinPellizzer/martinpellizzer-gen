    "intro": "Begonia smaragdina, commonly known as the Emerald Begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers with yellow stamens, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for container gardening and indoor spaces."
