    "intro": "Betula alatavica, commonly known as the Tien Shan birch, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its white bark and slender, upright growth habit. The leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, with serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is adapted to cold, mountainous environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
