    "intro": "Benstonea epiphytica, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has delicate, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its unique growth habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
