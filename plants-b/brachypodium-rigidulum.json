    "intro": "Brachypodium rigidulum, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
