    "intro": "Betula utilis var. glandulifera, commonly known as the European silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a silver sheen beneath, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The tree thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It has a shallow root system, making it susceptible to windthrow, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas. Its leaves are alternate, triangular, and turn yellow in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value."
