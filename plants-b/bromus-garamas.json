    "intro": "Bromus garamas, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus garamas is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
