    "intro": "Betula alba f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy white birch, is a variant of the white birch characterized by its dense, pubescent foliage. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical white birch, with leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The bark of Betula alba f. pubescens is pale and smooth, often displaying a subtle pattern of fissures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in temperate regions of Europe. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
