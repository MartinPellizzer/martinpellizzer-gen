It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with tuberous roots that help it survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually large and heart-shaped, and it produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and purple. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
