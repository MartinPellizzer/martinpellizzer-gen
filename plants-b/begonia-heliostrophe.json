    "intro": "Begonia heliostrophe, commonly known as the sun-tracking begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that exhibit a unique heliotropic behavior, following the sun's movement throughout the day. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its foliage is often marked with intricate patterns and contrasting colors, adding to its ornamental appeal. Begonia heliostrophe thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
