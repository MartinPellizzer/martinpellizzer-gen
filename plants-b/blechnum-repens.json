    "intro": "Blechnum repens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats of foliage. The fronds are typically lanceolate, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ability to propagate vegetatively makes it a common sight in moist, humid habitats."
