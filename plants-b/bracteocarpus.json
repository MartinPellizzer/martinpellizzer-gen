    "intro": "Bracteocarpus, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Celastraceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive bracteate inflorescences, where modified leaves (bracts) enclose the flowers. The genus includes several species, most of which are native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Bracteocarpus species typically have small, inconspicuous flowers and produce fleshy, berry-like fruits. They are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and shrublands."
