    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata subsp. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
