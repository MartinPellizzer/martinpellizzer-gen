    "intro": "Betula fruticosa var. macrostachys, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that exfoliates in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed hardwood forests."
