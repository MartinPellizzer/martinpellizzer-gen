    "intro": "Bromus arenarius var. macrostachya, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces compact, spike-like inflorescences with short, awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
