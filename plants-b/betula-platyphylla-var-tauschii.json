    "intro": "Betula platyphylla var. tauschii, commonly known as the Siberian birch, is a deciduous tree native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its leaves are triangular in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to harsh climates."
