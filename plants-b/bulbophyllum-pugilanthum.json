    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pugilanthum, commonly known as the Fighting Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and is typically found growing in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, often arranged in a raceme. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
