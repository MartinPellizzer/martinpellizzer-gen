    "intro": "Berteroa macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant burr plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its large, spiny fruits that resemble burrs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow and tubular. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
