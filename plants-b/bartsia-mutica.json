    "intro": "Bartsia mutica, commonly known as the sticky bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its parasitic nature, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pink or white, and its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance. Bartsia mutica is notable for its unique ecological role and is often found in association with specific host species."
