    "intro": "Bombax ellipticum, commonly known as the African silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds enclosed in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance in various African communities."
