    "intro": "Bolanthus frankenioides, commonly known as the plains coreopsis, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Bolanthus frankenioides has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, cylindrical seed heads that mature into fluffy, white pappus structures. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
