    "intro": "Banksia hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's banksia, is a striking shrub or small tree native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring, producing abundant golden-yellow flowers. The plant has rough, fibrous bark that peels away in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique texture. Banksia hookeriana is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
