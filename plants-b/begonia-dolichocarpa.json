    "intro": "Begonia dolichocarpa, commonly known as the long-stalked begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in gardens and as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
