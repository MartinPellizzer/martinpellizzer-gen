    "intro": "Banfiopuntia, commonly known as the \"Lace Flower\" or \"Cactus of the Moon,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the deserts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, often nocturnal flowers. The plants typically have a short, cylindrical stem with areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. Banfiopuntia species are known for their vibrant, colorful blooms that often open at night, attracting moths and other nocturnal pollinators. These plants are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems and relying on minimal rainfall for survival."
