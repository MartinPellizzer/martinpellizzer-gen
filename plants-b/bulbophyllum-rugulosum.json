    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rugulosum, commonly known as the rough-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system and its ability to form pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant typically produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the dry season. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a distinctive, rough texture, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
