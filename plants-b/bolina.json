    "intro": "Bolina, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, swollen trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically alternate and simple, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bolina species produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in umbels, and they are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. These plants are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and striking, often colorful, bark."
