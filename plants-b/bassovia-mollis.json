    "intro": "Bassovia mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas."
