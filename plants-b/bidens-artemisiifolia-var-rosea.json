It is characterized by its distinctive rose-colored bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually alternate and serrated. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along streambanks. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a weed in many regions."
