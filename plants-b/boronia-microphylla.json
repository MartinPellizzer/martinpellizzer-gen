    "intro": "Boronia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved boronia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, elliptical leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of fragrant flowers that attract nectar-feeding insects. Boronia microphylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
