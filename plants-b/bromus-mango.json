    "intro": "Bromus mango, commonly known as the mango grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, while the seed heads are usually pale yellow or brown. Bromus mango is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
