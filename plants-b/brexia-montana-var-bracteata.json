    "intro": "Brexia montana var. bracteata, commonly known as the Alpine Brexia, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention and protection from harsh weather. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountain ecosystems."
