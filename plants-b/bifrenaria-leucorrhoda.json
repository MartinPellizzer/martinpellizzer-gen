    "intro": "Bifrenaria leucorrhoda, commonly known as the white-flowered bifrenaria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Its most striking feature is its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
