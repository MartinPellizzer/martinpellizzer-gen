    "intro": "Brassica suttoniana, commonly known as Sutton's mustard, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family. It is a low-growing annual plant characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
