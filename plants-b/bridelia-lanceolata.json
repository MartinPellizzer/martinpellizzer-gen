    "intro": "Bridelia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bridelia, is a shrub native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Bridelia lanceolata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
