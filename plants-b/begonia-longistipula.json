It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and botanical study. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
