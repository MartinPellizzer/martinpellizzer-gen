    "intro": "Blechnum proliferum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Blechnum proliferum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are protected by a membranous indusium, a feature common among many ferns."
