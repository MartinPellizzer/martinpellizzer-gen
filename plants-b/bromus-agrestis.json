    "intro": "Bromus agrestis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Smooth brome is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is used in forage and erosion control."
