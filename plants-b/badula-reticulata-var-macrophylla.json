    "intro": "Badula reticulata var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf nettle, is a variant of the nettle family (Urticaceae) characterized by its distinctive, large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant features a dense covering of fine stinging hairs on its foliage and stems, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Its leaves are typically serrated with a waxy surface, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in certain regions."
