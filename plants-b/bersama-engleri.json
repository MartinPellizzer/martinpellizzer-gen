    "intro": "Bersama engleri, commonly known as the common alder, is a deciduous tree native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Bersama engleri is often found growing near water sources, such as rivers and streams, due to its preference for moist, well-drained soils."
