    "intro": "Brachistus ciliatus, commonly known as the slender sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Brachistus ciliatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
