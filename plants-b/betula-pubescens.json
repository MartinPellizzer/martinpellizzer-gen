    "intro": "Betula pubescens, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips. The tree produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. Betula pubescens is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively fast-growing."
