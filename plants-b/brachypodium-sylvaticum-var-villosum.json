    "intro": "Brachypodium sylvaticum var. villosum, commonly known as hairy bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in ecological restoration projects."
