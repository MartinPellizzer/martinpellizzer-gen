It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in clusters at the ends of branches. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like fibers that are used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall. The plant is also valued for its timber and is often used in local medicine."
