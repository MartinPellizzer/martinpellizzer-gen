    "intro": "Blechnum occidentale var. minus, commonly known as the lesser maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is native to the eastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, showcasing its adaptability to humid, nutrient-poor substrates. Its fronds are usually dark green and possess a leathery texture, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
