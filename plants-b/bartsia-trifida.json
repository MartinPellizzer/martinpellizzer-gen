    "intro": "Bartsia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed bartsia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are trifid, meaning they are divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Bartsia trifida produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, and it is often found growing in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
