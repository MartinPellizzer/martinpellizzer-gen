    "intro": "Beyeria rostellata, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Beyeria rostellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and subtle floral display."
