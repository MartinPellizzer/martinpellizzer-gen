    "intro": "Barringtonia procera, commonly known as the giant candle bush, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night. The tree's most distinctive feature is its long, drooping panicles of flowers, which resemble candles, hence its common name. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a fibrous, spongy material. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
