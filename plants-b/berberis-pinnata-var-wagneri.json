    "intro": "Berberis pinnata var. wagneri, commonly known as Wagner's barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically oval and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
