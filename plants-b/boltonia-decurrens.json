    "intro": "Boltonia decurrens, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fluffy, white to pale purple flower heads that resemble dandelions, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its aromatic, slightly sweet scent. Boltonia decurrens is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, thriving in partial to full shade."
