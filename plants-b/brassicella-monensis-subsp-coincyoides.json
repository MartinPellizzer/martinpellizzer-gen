    "intro": "Brassicella monensis subsp. coincyoides, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
