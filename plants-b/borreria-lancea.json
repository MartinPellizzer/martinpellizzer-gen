It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Borreria lancea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its vibrant yellow flowers bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to desert landscapes."
