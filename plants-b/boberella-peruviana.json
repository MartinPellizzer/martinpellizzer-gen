    "intro": "Boberella peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian boberella, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or dry soils, and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Boberella peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
