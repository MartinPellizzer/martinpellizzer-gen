    "intro": "Bouteloua vestita, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a native grass species found in the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for both ornamental and ecological landscaping. Silver bluestem is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
