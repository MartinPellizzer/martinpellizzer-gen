    "intro": "Buxus sinica var. aemulans, commonly known as the Chinese boxwood, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to China. It features dense, dark green foliage that is highly resistant to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. The plant has small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its slow growth rate and ability to maintain a neat shape contribute to its ornamental value. The leaves are leathery and glossy, providing year-round visual interest in gardens."
