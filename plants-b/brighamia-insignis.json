    "intro": "Brighamia insignis, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a large, showy flower head with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white ray flowers. Brighamia insignis is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and intense sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a symbol of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
