    "intro": "Banksia media, commonly known as the medium banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia media thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
