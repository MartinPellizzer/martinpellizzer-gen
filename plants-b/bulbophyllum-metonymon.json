    "intro": "Bulbophyllum metonymon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
