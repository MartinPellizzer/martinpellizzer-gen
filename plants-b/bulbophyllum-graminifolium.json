    "intro": "Bulbophyllum graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome system allows it to store nutrients and water, aiding in its survival in less fertile soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
