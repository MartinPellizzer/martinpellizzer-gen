    "intro": "Bromus dubius, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Bromus dubius is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
