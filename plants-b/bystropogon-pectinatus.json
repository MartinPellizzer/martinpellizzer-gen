    "intro": "Bystropogon pectinatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by oval, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many parts of its range."
