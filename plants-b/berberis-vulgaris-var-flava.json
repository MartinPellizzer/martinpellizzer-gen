It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that appear in early spring, followed by orange-red berries in the fall. The plant has thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its berries are toxic to humans and livestock, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
