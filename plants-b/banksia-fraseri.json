    "intro": "Banksia fraseri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, yellow to orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. Banksia fraseri is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for various pollinators."
