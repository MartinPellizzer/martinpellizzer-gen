    "intro": "Betula chinensis var. linearisquama, commonly known as the narrow-leaved birch, is a variant of the Chinese birch native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and often exhibits a pale or grayish color, which becomes more fissured with age. This species is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
