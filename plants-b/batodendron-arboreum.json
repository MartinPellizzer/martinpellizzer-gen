    "intro": "Batodendron arboreum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy, silver-green foliage that gives it its common name. The plant has a straight, slender trunk with a rounded crown, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate in shape. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a shade tree."
