    "intro": "Berlinia gilletii, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in some tropical regions for landscaping and timber."
