    "intro": "Blepharodon crabronum, commonly known as the goldenrod leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive golden or yellow coloration, which helps it blend with its host plants. This species primarily feeds on the sap of goldenrod plants, using its piercing-sucking mouthparts to extract nutrients. Its life cycle involves several nymphal stages before reaching adulthood, typically completing development within a few weeks. The plant's foliage provides both shelter and sustenance, making it a key component of its ecological niche."
