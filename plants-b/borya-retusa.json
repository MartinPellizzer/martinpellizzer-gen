    "intro": "Borya retusa, commonly known as the slender borya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Borya retusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
