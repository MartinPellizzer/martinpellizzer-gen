    "intro": "Bignonia fraxinoides, commonly known as the yellow glorybower, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are clustered in pendulous racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bignonia fraxinoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
