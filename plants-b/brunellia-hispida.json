    "intro": "Brunellia hispida, commonly known as the rough-leaved sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it often grows in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Brunellia hispida is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
