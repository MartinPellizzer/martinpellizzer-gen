It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange-pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of small, rounded leaflets, and it produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia moultonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun for optimal growth."
