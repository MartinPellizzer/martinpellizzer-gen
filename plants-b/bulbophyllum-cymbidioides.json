    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cymbidioides, commonly known as the Orchid of the Forest, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with intricate patterns, often in shades of yellow, green, and white. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cultivation."
