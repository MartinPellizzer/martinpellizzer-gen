    "intro": "Botrychium simplex var. laxifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moonwort, is a fern-like species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, with the lower leaves being smaller and more elongated. The plant produces a single, unbranched sporophyll that bears spores on its underside, typical of its reproductive structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its more loosely spaced leaves compared to the typical form of Botrychium simplex."
