    "intro": "Beccarianthus insignis, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
