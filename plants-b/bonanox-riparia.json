    "intro": "Bonanox riparia, commonly known as the riverbank bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and riverbanks of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, often with a slight hairy texture. Bonanox riparia is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing riverbank soils through its extensive root system."
