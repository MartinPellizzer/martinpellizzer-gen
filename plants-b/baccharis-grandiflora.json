    "intro": "Baccharis grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Baccharis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in sandy or coastal environments."
