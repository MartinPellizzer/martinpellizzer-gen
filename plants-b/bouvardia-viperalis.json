It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous clusters of tubular flowers. The plant produces vibrant pink to red flowers that bloom throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its leaves are ovate and slightly hairy, while the stems are often woody and branching. Bouvardia viperalis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
