    "intro": "Bromus villosus proles ambigens, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with slender, awned lemmas. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
