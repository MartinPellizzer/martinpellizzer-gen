    "intro": "Begonia modestiflora var. thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelii Begonia, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
