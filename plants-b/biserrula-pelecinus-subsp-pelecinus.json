    "intro": "Biserrula pelecinus subsp. pelecinus, commonly known as the pelecinus biserrula, is a leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often grown as a forage crop due to its high protein content and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a valuable species in dryland agriculture."
