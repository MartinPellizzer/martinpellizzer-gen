    "intro": "Broughtonia \u00d7 guanahacabibensis, commonly known as the Guanahacabib pineapple plant, is a hybrid member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. Broughtonia \u00d7 guanahacabibensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
