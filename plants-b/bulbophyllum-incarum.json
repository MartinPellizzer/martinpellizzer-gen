    "intro": "Bulbophyllum incarum, commonly known as the Orchid with the Red Spots, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers with distinctive red spots. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are typically fragrant and attract various pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
