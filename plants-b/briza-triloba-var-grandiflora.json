    "intro": "Briza triloba var. grandiflora, commonly known as the broadleaved goat's beard, is a perennial grass-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, arching inflorescences composed of slender, pale green to white bracts that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are primarily pollinated by wind. This ornamental plant is often used in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
