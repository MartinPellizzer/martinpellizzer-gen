    "intro": "Bolbitis ponmudiensis, commonly known as the Ponmudi fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bolbitis ponmudiensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
