    "intro": "Berberis vulgaris var. integerrima, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, spiny stems and clusters of small, oval leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Due to its thorny growth, it is often used as a hedge or barrier plant in gardens."
