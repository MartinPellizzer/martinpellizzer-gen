    "intro": "Betula glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its sap, which is sticky and resinous, has been used by Indigenous peoples for various purposes. Betula glutinosa typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
