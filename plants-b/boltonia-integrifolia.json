It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow central disk, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Boltonia integrifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
