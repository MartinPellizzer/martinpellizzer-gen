    "intro": "Billbergia \u00d7 worleana, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Billbergia nana and Billbergia zebrina. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This hybrid is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
