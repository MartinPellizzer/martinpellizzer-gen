    "intro": "Brassica oleracea var. protojodusa, commonly known as the wild cabbage, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette near the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by round, green pods containing seeds. It is a wild relative of several cultivated Brassica species, including broccoli and cabbage. Its botanical features make it an important species for genetic research and breeding programs."
