    "intro": "Bilabrella vollesenii, commonly known as the velvetleaf bilabrella, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
