    "intro": "Brayopsis trichocarpa, commonly known as the coastal bracken, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky coastal areas. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, soft hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Brayopsis trichocarpa plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
