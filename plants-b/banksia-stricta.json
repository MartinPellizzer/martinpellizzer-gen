    "intro": "Banksia stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, cylindrical flower spikes that appear in winter and spring. The plant produces distinctive woody cones that persist on the plant for several years, releasing seeds when the cones open. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and it is adapted to the dry, nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Banksia stricta plays an important ecological role, providing nectar for honeyeaters and other pollinators."
