    "intro": "Bituminaria, commonly known as bituminous thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. These plants are characterized by their spiny, upright stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds. Bituminaria is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
