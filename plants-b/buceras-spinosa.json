It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and its showy, spire-like inflorescences that produce purple or violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its distinctive spines and architectural form contribute to its ornamental value. Buceras spinosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
