    "intro": "Bromus induratus, commonly known as the hard brome, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and rigid, often hairy leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in rangelands, roadsides, and other open areas. Bromus induratus is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
