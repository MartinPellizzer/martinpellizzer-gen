    "intro": "Betula pendula var. lapponica, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular with serrated edges and turn yellow in autumn before falling. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. This species is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
