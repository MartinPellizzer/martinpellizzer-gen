    "intro": "Betula tortuosa var. genuina, commonly known as the European birch, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that becomes fissured with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn golden in autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
