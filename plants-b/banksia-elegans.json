    "intro": "Banksia elegans, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a species of shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that produce abundant yellow flowers, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Banksia elegans is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and can tolerate periods of drought. It plays an important ecological role in providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
