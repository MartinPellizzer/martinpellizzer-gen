    "intro": "Bromus densus, commonly known as the dense brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus densus is an important forage plant for livestock but can also become invasive in certain environments."
