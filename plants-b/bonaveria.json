    "intro": "Bonaveria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or white powdery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Bonaveria species typically produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These plants are often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their striking foliage and vibrant blooms."
