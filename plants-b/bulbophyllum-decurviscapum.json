    "intro": "Bulbophyllum decurviscapum, commonly known as the curved-stem orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its bulbs are a key feature, allowing it to store water and nutrients for periods of drought. The flowers often display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple, making it a popular choice for horticultural collections."
