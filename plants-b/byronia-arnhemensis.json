It features smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Byronia arnhemensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native wildlife."
