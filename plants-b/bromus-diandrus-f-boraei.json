    "intro": "Bromus diandrus f. boraei, commonly known as the alpine brome, is a rare, low-growing grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish spikelets, which contain the reproductive structures. It thrives in cold, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions."
