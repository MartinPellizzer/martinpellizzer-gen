    "intro": "Botryosicyos, commonly known as the African bottle tree, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, an adaptation to its arid native habitat in sub-Saharan Africa. The plant produces large, palmate leaves and yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruits are cylindrical, green pods that contain edible seeds. Botryosicyos is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
