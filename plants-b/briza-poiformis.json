    "intro": "Briza poiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, upright stems that bear small, pale green to blue-gray spikelets. The leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
