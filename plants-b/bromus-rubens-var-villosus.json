It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle with spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple. This variety is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
