It is a small, annual herb with a basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with four petals, which are arranged in a cross shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
