    "intro": "Bixa tinctaria, commonly known as the \"Congo butternut,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces an orange-red seed pod that contains a rich, oily seed known for its high content of carotenoids. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye due to their vibrant color. Bixa tinctaria thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
