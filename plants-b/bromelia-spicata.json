    "intro": "Bromelia spicata, commonly known as the spiny bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to store water in arid environments. Bromelia spicata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
