    "intro": "Byttneria obcordata, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its dense, dark color and is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
