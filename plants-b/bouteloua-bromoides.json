    "intro": "Bouteloua bromoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and prairies. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that mature into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Blue grama is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping."
