    "intro": "Bauhinia scandens var. horsfieldii, commonly known as the climbing bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous vine native to Southeast Asia. It features bipinnate leaves that are often trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in summer. Its twining stems allow it to climb and form dense foliage, making it suitable for ornamental use in gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
