    "intro": "Bonduc majus, commonly known as the large nutmeg tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Myristicaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant produces a large, woody fruit that contains a single seed, which is encased in a hard, aromatic shell. The seeds are used to produce a spice similar to nutmeg, though it is less commonly used in modern cuisine. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but rare species in botanical collections."
