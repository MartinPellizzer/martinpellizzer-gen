    "intro": "Boscia firma, commonly known as the yellow boscia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Capparaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, thorny branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange or red fruits, which are edible for both humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. Boscia firma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
