    "intro": "Banksia nobilis, commonly known as the golden banksia, is a flowering plant native to the south-west of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical inflorescence, which is composed of numerous yellow to golden flowers. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Banksia nobilis thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
