    "intro": "Bromus alopecuros subsp. biaristulatus, commonly known as the woolly brome, is a grass species native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, which are often reddish-brown in color. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid environments."
