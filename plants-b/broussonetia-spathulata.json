    "intro": "Broussonetia spathulata, commonly known as the broadleaf Chinese chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features simple, alternate leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits that are encased in a spiny husk. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Broussonetia spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
