The plant produces showy, pink to red bracteate flowers in late summer, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Bistorta emodi subsp. emodi thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
