    "intro": "Betula kweichowensis subsp. kweichowensis, commonly known as the Kweichow birch, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that often peels in thin, papery layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This species thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
