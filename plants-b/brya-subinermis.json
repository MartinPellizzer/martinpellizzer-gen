    "intro": "Brya subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on rocky surfaces, often in moist, shaded environments. Brya subinermis is typically found in temperate regions, including parts of North America and Europe. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, contain spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
