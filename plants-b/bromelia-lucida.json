    "intro": "Bromelia lucida, commonly known as the silver velleius, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery wax, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Bromelia lucida is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
