    "intro": "Bromopsis texensis, commonly known as the Texas bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromopsis texensis is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
