    "intro": "Bomarea edulis var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned edible bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences. The plant features tuberous roots that store nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy texture. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ornamental value."
