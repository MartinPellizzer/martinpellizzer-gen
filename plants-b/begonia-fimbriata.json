    "intro": "Begonia fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, fimbriated (fringed) petals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often with velvety leaves and vibrant, showy flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce clusters of small, colorful blooms throughout the growing season."
