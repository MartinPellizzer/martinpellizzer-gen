    "intro": "Bentia, commonly known as the silver leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage. The leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Bentia produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
