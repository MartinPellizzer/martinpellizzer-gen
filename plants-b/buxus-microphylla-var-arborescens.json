    "intro": "Buxus microphylla var. arborescens, commonly known as the dwarf boxwood tree, is a compact, slow-growing evergreen shrub native to western Europe. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically no more than 1 cm in length. The plant has a naturally rounded form, making it ideal for topiary and formal garden designs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, requiring minimal pruning to maintain its shape. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often used as a foundation plant or in rock gardens."
