    "intro": "Bolbitis boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Bonin Islands. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a narrow, linear shape. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical features make it an important subject for studies on island endemic flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range."
