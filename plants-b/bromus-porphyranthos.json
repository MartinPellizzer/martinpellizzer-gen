    "intro": "Bromus porphyranthos, commonly known as the purple-flowered brome, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and purple-tinged inflorescences, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Bromus porphyranthos plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
