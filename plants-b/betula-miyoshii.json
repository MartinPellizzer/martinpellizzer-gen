    "intro": "Betula miyoshii, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that resembles paper, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The tree has slender, zigzagging branches and produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Betula miyoshii typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
