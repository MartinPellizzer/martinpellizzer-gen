    "intro": "Burmeistera serratifolia, commonly known as the serrated burmeistera, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are serrated and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat.
