    "intro": "Begonia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for container gardening or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its scientific name \"pumilio,\" meaning \"dusty\" or \"little.\" It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil."
