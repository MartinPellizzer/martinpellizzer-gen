    "intro": "Begonia gossweileri, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements. Begonia gossweileri is also valued for its ability to purify the air and increase humidity in indoor spaces."
