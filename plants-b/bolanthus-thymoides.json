    "intro": "Bolanthus thymoides, commonly known as sweetroot or wild thyme, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. The plant has aromatic leaves that emit a strong, pleasant scent when crushed, similar to thyme. Its small, white to pink flowers bloom in clusters and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Bolanthus thymoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
