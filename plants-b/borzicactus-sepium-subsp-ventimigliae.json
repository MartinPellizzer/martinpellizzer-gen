    "intro": "Borzicactus sepium subsp. ventimigliae, commonly known as the Ventimiglia's borzicactus, is a rare and specialized cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its columnar stem with ribbed structure and spiny areoles, typical of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
