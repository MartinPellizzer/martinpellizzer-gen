    "intro": "Bulbophyllum striatitepalum, commonly known as the striped lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, often featuring contrasting stripes or spots. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Bulbophyllum striatitepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation under proper care."
