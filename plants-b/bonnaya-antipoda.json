    "intro": "Bonnaya antipoda, commonly known as the Antipodean bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the remote regions of New Zealand. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant features a short, upright stem and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Bonnaya antipoda is considered a valuable species for botanical study."
