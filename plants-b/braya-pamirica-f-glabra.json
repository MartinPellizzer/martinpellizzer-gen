It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains, it thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong sunlight. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to its harsh alpine habitat."
