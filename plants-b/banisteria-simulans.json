It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with bright red petals and a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by bees and other insects.
