It features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
