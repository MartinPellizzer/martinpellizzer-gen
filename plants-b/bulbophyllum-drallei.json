    "intro": "Bulbophyllum drallei, commonly known as the Dralle's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a sympodial epiphytic orchid that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Bulbophyllum drallei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and adaptability to cultivation."
