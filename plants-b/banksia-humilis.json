    "intro": "Banksia humilis, commonly known as the low banksia, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after the follicles dry and split open. Banksia humilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
