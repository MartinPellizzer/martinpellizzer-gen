    "intro": "Bromus turkestanicus, commonly known as the Turkestan brome, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bromus turkestanicus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
