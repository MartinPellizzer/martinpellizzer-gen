    "intro": "Brachyloma stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed mountain billygoat, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It typically grows in heathlands and open forests, often in well-drained sandy soils. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, producing yellow to orange blooms that attract nectar-feeding insects. Brachyloma stenolobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
