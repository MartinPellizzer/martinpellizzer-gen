    "intro": "Botryceras, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, often blue or purple, bract-like flowers that resemble small, rounded clusters. Botryceras species typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to sandy or rocky soils. They are perennial herbs that often have a compact growth habit and are valued for their ornamental appeal. The genus includes several species, such as Botryceras corymbosum, which is known for its dense, showy inflorescences."
