    "intro": "Bletia lyonsii, commonly known as the Lyon's bletia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features a sympodial growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Bletia lyonsii is an important component of the understory flora in its native habitat."
