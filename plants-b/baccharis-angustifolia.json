    "intro": "Baccharis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Baccharis angustifolia plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
