    "intro": "Breynia garrettii, commonly known as the silverleaf breynia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Breynia garrettii is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
