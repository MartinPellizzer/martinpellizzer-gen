    "intro": "Banksia lepidorhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Banksia lepidorhiza is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly nectar-feeding birds and insects."
