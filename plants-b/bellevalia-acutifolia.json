    "intro": "Bellevalia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped, sharply pointed leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Bellevalia acutifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
