    "intro": "Bartsia jujuyensis, commonly known as the Jujuy bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Argentina. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
