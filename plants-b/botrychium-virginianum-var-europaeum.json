    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum var. europaeum, commonly known as the European moonwort, is a fern-like plant characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is known for its unique morphology, featuring a central stalk with two pairs of fiddlehead-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium virginianum var. europaeum is a rare and ancient species with a limited distribution across Europe and parts of Asia."
