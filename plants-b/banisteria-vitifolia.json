    "intro": "Banisteria vitifolia, commonly known as the purple glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a woody vine that produces striking clusters of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Banisteria vitifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
