It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous branches and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces catkin-like flowers, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. Its bark is smooth and white, with a distinctive peeling texture. Betula leptostachya is often found in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream valleys."
