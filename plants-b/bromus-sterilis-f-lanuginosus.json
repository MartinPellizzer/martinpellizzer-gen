    "intro": "Bromus sterilis f. lanuginosus, commonly known as the downy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to brown, with small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
