It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and is often found in sandy soils near the coast. It is adapted to saline and well-drained environments, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature."
