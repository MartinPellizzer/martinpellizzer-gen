    "intro": "Brunia cupressina, commonly known as the African cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage composed of scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive, almost cypress-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature. Brunia cupressina is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
