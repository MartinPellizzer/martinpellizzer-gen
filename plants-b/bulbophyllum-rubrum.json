It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in greenhouses and terrariums."
