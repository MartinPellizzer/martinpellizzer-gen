    "intro": "Billardiera uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered, white or greenish flowers. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, fleshy berries that are typically red or yellow. It grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized root structures called haustoria. Billardiera uniflora is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
