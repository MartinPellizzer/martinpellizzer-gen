    "intro": "Berzelia lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly berzelia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a subtle aesthetic to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
