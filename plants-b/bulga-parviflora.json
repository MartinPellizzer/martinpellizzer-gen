    "intro": "Bulga parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bulga, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps to reduce water loss. Bulga parviflora is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
