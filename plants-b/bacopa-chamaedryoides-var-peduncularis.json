    "intro": "Bacopa chamaedryoides var. peduncularis, commonly known as creeping bacopa, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
