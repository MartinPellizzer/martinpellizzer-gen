    "intro": "Betula verrucosa subsp. fallax, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems. The subspecies fallax is notable for its slightly smaller size and more slender form compared to other birch species."
