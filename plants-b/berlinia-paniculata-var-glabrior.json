    "intro": "Berlinia paniculata var. glabrior, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and smooth, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of tannins."
