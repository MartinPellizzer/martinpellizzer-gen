    "intro": "Bromus \u00d7 gusuleacii, commonly known as the hybrid brome, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Bromus diandrus and Bromus catharticus. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including a robust root system and a tall, erect growth habit. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are often loosely arranged. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
