    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fusion of its sepals and petals, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the dry season. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its striking appearance, it is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for cultivation."
