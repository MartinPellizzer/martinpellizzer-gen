    "intro": "Brizophile, commonly known as the \"bark lichen,\" is a type of lichen that grows on the bark of trees. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Brizophile thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on the trunks of deciduous trees. Its presence can indicate the health of the surrounding ecosystem."
