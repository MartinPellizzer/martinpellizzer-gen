    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mishmeense, commonly known as the Mishme orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged in a spike, with petals that vary in color from white to pink. The orchid's bulb-like structures, known as pseudobulbs, store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat."
