    "intro": "Billbergia \u00d7 vexillaria, commonly known as the hybrid billbergia, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Billbergia nasta and Billbergia zebrina. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance of low light and ability to thrive in well-draining potting mix. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
