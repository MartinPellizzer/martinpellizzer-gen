    "intro": "Betula pumila f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular birch, is a shrub-like variant of the dwarf birch. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often glandular-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic regions. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
