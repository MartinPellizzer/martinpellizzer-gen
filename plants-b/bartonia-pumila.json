    "intro": "Bartonia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf pearly everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Bartonia pumila is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
