It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, Boaria molinae is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
