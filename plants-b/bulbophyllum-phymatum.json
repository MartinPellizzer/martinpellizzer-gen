    "intro": "Bulbophyllum phymatum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized structures called pseudobulbs for water and nutrient storage. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often blooming in the summer months. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
