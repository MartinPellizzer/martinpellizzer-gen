    "intro": "Baptisia aberrans, commonly known as false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of blue to purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are alternate and often have a slightly hairy texture. Baptisia aberrans is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in USDA zones 4 through 8. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind."
