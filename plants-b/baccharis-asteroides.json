    "intro": "Baccharis asteroides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. Baccharis asteroides is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
