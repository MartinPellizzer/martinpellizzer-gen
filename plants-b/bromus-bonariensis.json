    "intro": "Bromus bonariensis, commonly known as smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to South America. It has tufted, slender leaves that are usually hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and agricultural fields. Bromus bonariensis is widely used for forage and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
