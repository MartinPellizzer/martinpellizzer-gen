    "intro": "Biermannia naja, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid that grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has a unique root system that absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Biermannia naja is considered critically endangered in many regions."
