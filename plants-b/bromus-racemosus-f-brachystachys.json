    "intro": "Bromus racemosus f. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked brome, is a variant of the tall brome species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. The plant features slender, erect stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, two-lobed glumes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the flowers are wind-pollinated, typical of many grass species. This subspecies is valued in ecological studies for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
