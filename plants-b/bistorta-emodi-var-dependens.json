It features upright, rhizomatous stems that bear broad, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white tubular flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Botanically, it is characterized by its robust growth habit and adaptation to cold, alpine environments."
