    "intro": "Bupleurum scorzonerifolium f. latum, commonly known as the broad-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat woolly texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be harvested for medicinal use, though it is less commonly utilized compared to other bupleurum species. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats."
