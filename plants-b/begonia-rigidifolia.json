    "intro": "Begonia rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid-leaved begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive rigid texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Begonia rigidifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and compact growth form."
