    "intro": "Bromopsis ramosa subsp. benekenii, commonly known as the Beneken's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
