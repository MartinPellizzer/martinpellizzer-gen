    "intro": "Bunium longipes var. ellipsoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fennel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a subtle licorice scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its seeds are small, dry, and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate and alpine climates. Due to its unique morphology and chemical composition, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
