    "intro": "Bauhinia oxysepala, commonly known as the velvetwood or yellow bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, papery, and often colorful leaflets that turn yellow or red before falling. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its unique leaf structure, with small, rounded leaflets arranged in pairs, is a notable botanical feature. Bauhinia oxysepala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
