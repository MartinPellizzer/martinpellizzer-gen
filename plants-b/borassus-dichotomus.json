    "intro": "Borassus dichotomus, commonly known as the double-seeded palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clustered inflorescences with small, white flowers, followed by fruit that splits open to reveal two seeds. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts, and the trunk is sometimes processed for its fibrous material. This species is adapted to coastal and lowland areas, thriving in humid, warm climates."
