    "intro": "Benzoin trilobum, commonly known as the Indian benzoin or Malabar benzoin, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish resin that is harvested from its bark and used in traditional medicine and incense. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
