    "intro": "Bromus marginatus subsp. maritimus, commonly known as the sea brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silver or grayish margin. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
