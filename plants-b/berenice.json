    "intro": "Berenice, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Berenice thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
