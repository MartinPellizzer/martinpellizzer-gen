    "intro": "Briza erecta var. parviflora, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
