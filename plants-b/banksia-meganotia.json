    "intro": "Banksia meganotia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a striking plant native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that produces abundant yellow flowers, which attract a variety of nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and can tolerate periods of drought. Banksia meganotia plays an important ecological role in its environment, providing food and habitat for native wildlife."
