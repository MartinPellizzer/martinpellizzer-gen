    "intro": "Bactris broadwayi, commonly known as the broadway palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, football-shaped fruits. Bactris broadwayi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
