    "intro": "Betula pubescens subsp. suecica, commonly known as the downy birch, is a deciduous tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in forest ecosystems."
