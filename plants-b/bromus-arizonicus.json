    "intro": "Bromus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona brome, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in clusters, with each containing two to three flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Bromus arizonicus is an important component of local ecosystems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in dry regions."
