    "intro": "Bromus purgans var. texensis, commonly known as Texas burrgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikelets that bear bristly, awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in a bur-like structure, which can adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. This variety is adapted to arid conditions and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
