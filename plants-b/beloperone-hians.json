    "intro": "Beloperone hians, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found growing in wet, lowland areas. Beloperone hians is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in some regions."
