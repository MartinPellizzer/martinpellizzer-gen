    "intro": "Bhutanthera, commonly known as the Bhutanese flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayan regions of Bhutan and neighboring countries. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Bhutanthera plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
