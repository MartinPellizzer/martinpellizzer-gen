It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in arid conditions, showcasing its adaptation to drought-prone environments."
