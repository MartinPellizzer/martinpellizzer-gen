It is characterized by its dense, showy clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamp edges, and along riverbanks. Baccharis corymbosa plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators and waterfowl."
