    "intro": "Baccharis erigeroides, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
