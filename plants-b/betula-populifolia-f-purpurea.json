    "intro": "Betula populifolia f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-leaf poplar, is a variant of the trembling aspen that exhibits striking purple foliage. This ornamental tree is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn a vibrant purple in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins that hang from the branches in early spring. Due to its unique coloration and adaptability, it is a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
