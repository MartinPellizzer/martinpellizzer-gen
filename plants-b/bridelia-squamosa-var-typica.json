It is characterized by its rough, often fissured bark and opposite, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental potential and has traditional uses in some local cultures."
