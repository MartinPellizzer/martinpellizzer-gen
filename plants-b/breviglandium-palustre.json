    "intro": "Breviglandium palustre, commonly known as the marsh bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in wetlands and marshy areas. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, floating leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Breviglandium palustre plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to nutrient cycling."
