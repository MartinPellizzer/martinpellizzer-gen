    "intro": "Brodiaea leichtlinii, commonly known as the Sierra Valley brodiaea, is a flowering plant native to California and southern Oregon. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
