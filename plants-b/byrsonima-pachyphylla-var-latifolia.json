    "intro": "Byrsonima pachyphylla var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wax apple, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by round, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. The fruit contains a single, large seed enclosed in a fleshy, edible pulp. This species is adapted to dry climates and is often found in savannas and dry forests."
