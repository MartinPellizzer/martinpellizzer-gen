    "intro": "Berberis wallichiana var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf barberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayas. It features small, dark green leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant bears red, orange, or yellow berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes."
