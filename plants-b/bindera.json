It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic, and somewhat sweet-smelling root that has been used in traditional medicine. Bindera thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
