    "intro": "Bromus gracilis var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect culms and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing a single floret. This grass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock and wildlife."
