    "intro": "Betula verrucosa var. obscura, commonly known as the dark paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its dark, almost black bark that contrasts with its white, papery inner layers. It is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America, typically found in boreal forests and mountainous areas. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and has opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples and is also valued for its aesthetic appeal in landscaping. The species is adapted to cold climates and is often an indicator of ecological health in forest ecosystems."
