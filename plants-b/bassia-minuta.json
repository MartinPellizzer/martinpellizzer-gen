    "intro": "Bassia minuta, commonly known as dwarf tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Bassia minuta is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
