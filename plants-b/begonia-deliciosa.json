    "intro": "Begonia deliciosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
