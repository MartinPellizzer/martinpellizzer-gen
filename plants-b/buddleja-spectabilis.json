    "intro": "Buddleja spectabilis, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, nectar-rich flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces long, narrow leaves and has a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age. It is particularly valued in gardens for attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
