It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice among gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
