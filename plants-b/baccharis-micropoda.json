    "intro": "Baccharis micropoda, commonly known as white baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Baccharis micropoda is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
