    "intro": "Banisteria pubipetala f. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banisteria, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists. Due to habitat loss and limited propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
