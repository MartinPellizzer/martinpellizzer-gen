    "intro": "Begonia mursalaensis, commonly known as the Mursala begonia, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, depending on the subspecies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
