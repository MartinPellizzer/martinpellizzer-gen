    "intro": "Brachycereus, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale in color and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Brachycereus species are succulent plants that store water in their thick stems, allowing them to survive in arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their striking appearance and unique blooming habits."
