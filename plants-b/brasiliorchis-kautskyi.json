    "intro": "Brasiliorchis kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded understory of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
