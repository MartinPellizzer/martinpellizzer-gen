    "intro": "Bauhinia longipetala, commonly known as the velvetwood or flame tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn bright red or orange during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Bauhinia longipetala has a shallow root system and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
