    "intro": "Bromelia aquosa, commonly known as the aquatic bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool capable of holding water. The plant's leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a pointed tip, which helps in water retention. It produces striking, colorful bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. Bromelia aquosa is often found in wetland environments and is adapted to thrive in high humidity and moist soil conditions."
