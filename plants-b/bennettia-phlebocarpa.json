    "intro": "Bennettia phlebocarpa, commonly known as the Bennettia tree, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous tree with a distinctive, gnarled trunk and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role as a relict species from the Tertiary period. Bennettia phlebocarpa is also notable for its ability to thrive in wetland and swampy habitats."
