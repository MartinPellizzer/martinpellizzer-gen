    "intro": "Buforrestia brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited buforrestia, is a rare and little-studied plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral and foliar structures. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, a feature that gives it its specific epithet \"brachycarpa.\" Its leaves are simple and alternate, often with a hairy texture, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
