    "intro": "Baccharis serrula, commonly known as the roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its grayish bark and narrow, serrated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Baccharis serrula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in arid landscapes."
