    "intro": "Biscutella rupestris, commonly known as the rock biscuitflower, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Biscutella rupestris is often found in limestone soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens."
