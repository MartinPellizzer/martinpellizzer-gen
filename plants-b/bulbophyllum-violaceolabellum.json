    "intro": "Bulbophyllum violaceolabellum, commonly known as the violet-labellum orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive, spurred labellum that is often a striking shade of purple. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom successfully."
