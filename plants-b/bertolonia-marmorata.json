    "intro": "Bertolonia marmorata, commonly known as the marble fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features elegant, arching fronds that are deeply divided and covered in a distinctive mottled pattern of light and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense, carpet-like colonies. The leaves are typically leathery and provide a lush, ornamental appearance in both indoor and outdoor settings."
