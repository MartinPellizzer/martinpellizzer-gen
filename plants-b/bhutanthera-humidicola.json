    "intro": "Bhutanthera humidicola, commonly known as the Bhutanese orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Bhutan. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. The plant typically grows in shaded, forested areas at high altitudes, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its unique botanical features, including its intricate floral structure and specialized root system, make it an important subject of study in botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bhutanthera humidicola is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
