It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
