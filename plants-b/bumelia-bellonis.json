    "intro": "Bumelia bellonis, commonly known as the whitebumelia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by elliptical, dark green leaves. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Bumelia bellonis is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in pine flatwoods."
