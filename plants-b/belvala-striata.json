    "intro": "Belvala striata, commonly known as the stripeleaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with distinct, wavy stripes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in shades of white and green, adding to its ornamental value. Belvala striata requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
