    "intro": "Bombax humile, commonly known as the little cotton tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, cotton-like seed capsules. Its fibrous seeds are encased in a spongy, cottony material, which is used in traditional crafts and as a natural insulator. Bombax humile is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
