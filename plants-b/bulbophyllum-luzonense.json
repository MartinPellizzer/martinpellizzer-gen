    "intro": "Bulbophyllum luzonense, commonly known as the Luzon pineapple orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its fleshy, segmented pseudobulbs and long, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
