    "intro": "Bolbitis fengiana, commonly known as the Fengian shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are broad and often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Bolbitis fengiana is considered a conservation concern."
