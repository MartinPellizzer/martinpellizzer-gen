    "intro": "Bourreria mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
