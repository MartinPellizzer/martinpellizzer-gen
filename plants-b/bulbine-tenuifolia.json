    "intro": "Bulbine tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbine, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
