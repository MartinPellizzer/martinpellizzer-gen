    "intro": "Broughtonia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Broughtonia grandiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique structure and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for both ornamental and botanical gardens."
