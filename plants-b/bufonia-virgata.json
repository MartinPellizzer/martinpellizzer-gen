    "intro": "Bufonia virgata, commonly known as the sandstone lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like structure and a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces and soil in regions with low rainfall. Bufonia virgata plays a role in soil stabilization and is an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
