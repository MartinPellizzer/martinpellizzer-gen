    "intro": "Bulbophyllum longistelidium, commonly known as the long-stemmed bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip structure. Its bulbs are an essential part of its growth cycle, storing nutrients for periods of drought. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
