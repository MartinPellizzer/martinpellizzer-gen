    "intro": "Berberis morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's barberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It features thorny stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
