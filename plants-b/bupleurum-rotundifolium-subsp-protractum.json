    "intro": "Bupleurum rotundifolium subsp. protractum, commonly known as the long-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often lobed leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer. The subspecies protractum is distinguished by its elongated leaves and slightly different floral morphology compared to the typical form of Bupleurum rotundifolium."
