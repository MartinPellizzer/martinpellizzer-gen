    "intro": "Bromus palaestinus, commonly known as the Palestinian brome, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Bromus palaestinus is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
