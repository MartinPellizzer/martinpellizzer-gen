    "intro": "Bistorta officinalis subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bistorta, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream sides. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
