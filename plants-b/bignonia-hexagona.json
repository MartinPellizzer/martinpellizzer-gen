    "intro": "Bignonia hexagona, commonly known as the yellow bellvista, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its stems are covered in fine, reddish-brown hairs, and the flowers emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Bignonia hexagona thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms."
