    "intro": "Bromus proximus, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that often form dense tussocks, and its leaves are narrow and somewhat hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of spikelets, each containing several small, two-rowed florets. Bromus proximus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
