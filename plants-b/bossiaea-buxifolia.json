    "intro": "Bossiaea buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf bossiaea, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. Bossiaea buxifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
