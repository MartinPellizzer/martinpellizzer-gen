    "intro": "Baccharis gratissima, commonly known as sweet baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, and it has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties. Its drought tolerance makes it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
