It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshade plants, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers.

Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds when mature."
