    "intro": "Bactris panamensis, commonly known as the Panama wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, coconut-like fruits that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
