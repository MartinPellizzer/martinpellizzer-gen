It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun exposure. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while the flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
