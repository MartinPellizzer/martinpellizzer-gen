    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lobbii subsp. boreoborneense, commonly known as the Bornean Bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically features long, narrow leaves and bears clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
