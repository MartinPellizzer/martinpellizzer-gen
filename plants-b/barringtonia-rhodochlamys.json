It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The tree produces a capsule fruit that splits open to release its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and have a smooth texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
