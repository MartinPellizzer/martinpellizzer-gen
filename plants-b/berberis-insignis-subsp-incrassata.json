    "intro": "Berberis insignis subsp. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved barberry, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and elliptical leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
