    "intro": "Bauhinia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters. Its fruit is a flat, pod-like structure that splits open to release its seeds. Bauhinia borneensis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
