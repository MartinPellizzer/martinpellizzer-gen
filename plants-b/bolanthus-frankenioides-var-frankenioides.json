    "intro": "Bolanthus frankenioides var. frankenioides, commonly known as the plains prickly pear, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species."
