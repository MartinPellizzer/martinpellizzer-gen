    "intro": "Byttneria urticifolis var. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Stinging Tree, is a variant of the stinging tree species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often thorny stems and leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its stinging properties, it is typically handled with care in horticultural and ecological studies."
