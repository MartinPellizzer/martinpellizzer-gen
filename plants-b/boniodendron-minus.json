    "intro": "Boniodendron minus, commonly known as the lesser birch, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, with a dense, compact form. The plant has smooth, grayish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green on top with a silvery underside. It produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Boniodendron minus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and hardy nature."
