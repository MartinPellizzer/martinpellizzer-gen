    "intro": "Bupleurum aristatum var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's silvery bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at elevations between 1,200 and 2,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
