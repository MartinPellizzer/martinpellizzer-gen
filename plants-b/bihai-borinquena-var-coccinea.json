    "intro": "Bihai borinquena var. coccinea, commonly known as the Red Flame Hoya, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of red and pink, which bloom throughout the year under proper care. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
