    "intro": "Baccharis vitis-idaea, commonly known as sweet fern, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its feathery, fern-like leaves that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Sweet fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
