    "intro": "Baeothryon festucoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Baeothryon festucoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
