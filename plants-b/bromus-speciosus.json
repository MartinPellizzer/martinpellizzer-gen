    "intro": "Bromus speciosus, commonly known as the showy brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple or pink, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Bromus speciosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
