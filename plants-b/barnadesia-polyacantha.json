It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features numerous thorns along its branches, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically ovate with a velvety texture, and it thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil. Barnadesia polyacantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
