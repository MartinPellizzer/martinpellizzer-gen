    "intro": "Banksia fraseri var. crebra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, woody cones, which are a defining feature of the Banksia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. This variety is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
