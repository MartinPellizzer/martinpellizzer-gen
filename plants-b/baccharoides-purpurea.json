    "intro": "Baccharoides purpurea, commonly known as purple baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green leaves and showy clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, woody fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and along roadsides. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
