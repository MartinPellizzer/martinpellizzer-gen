    "intro": "Bartsia tricolor, commonly known as the three-color orchid, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. The plant produces delicate, three-colored flowers that range from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Bartsia tricolor is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in woodland and grassland habitats, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
