    "intro": "Baeobotrys virgata, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and surrounding substrates. Baeobotrys virgata thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees in the understory of dense rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
