    "intro": "Bothriocline upembensis, commonly known as the Kafue River lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Kafue River in Zambia. It features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to anchor in muddy substrates and store nutrients. Bothriocline upembensis plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic life."
