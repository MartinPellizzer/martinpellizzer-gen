    "intro": "Baccharis decussata, commonly known as blue curlleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive curling shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
