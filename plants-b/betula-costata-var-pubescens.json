    "intro": "Betula costata var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent birch, is a variant of the costata birch, characterized by its hairy or pubescent surfaces on its stems and leaves. It is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia, including regions of China and the Korean Peninsula. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. The bark is smooth and pale, often developing shallow fissures as the tree matures. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an important food source for pollinators."
