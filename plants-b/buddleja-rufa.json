    "intro": "Buddleja rufa, commonly known as the red-leaf buddleia, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking reddish-purple foliage, which adds visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces fragrant, spike-like clusters of flowers that range from pale lavender to deep purple, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja rufa is often used in ornamental landscaping for its vibrant color and easy maintenance."
