    "intro": "Bellium nivale, commonly known as the snow bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, fibrous root system adapted to cold, rocky soils. Bellium nivale is known for its resilience to harsh winter conditions and is often found in snowfields during the spring."
