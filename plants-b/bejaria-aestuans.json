    "intro": "Bejaria aestuans, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in marshes and along the edges of tidal pools. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often twining. Bejaria aestuans plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
