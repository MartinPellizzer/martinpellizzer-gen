    "intro": "Bolbitis angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pined fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give it a finely textured appearance. Bolbitis angustipinna prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests."
