    "intro": "Bletia cucullata var. cuspidata, commonly known as the hooded bletia, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like bracts that enclose the flower spike, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
