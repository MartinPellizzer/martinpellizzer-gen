    "intro": "Bromus ciliatus var. scariosus, commonly known as the scaly bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a distinctive scaly sheath. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are typically arranged in a panicle structure. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping."
