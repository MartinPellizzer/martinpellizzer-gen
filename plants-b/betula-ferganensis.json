    "intro": "Betula ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana birch, is a species of birch native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. This hardy species thrives in mountainous regions and is often found in forest-steppe ecosystems."
