    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cardiobulbum, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique heart-shaped pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal environments. The plant produces striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often with intricate patterns resembling hearts. Its leaves are typically broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Due to its ornamental value, it is popular in horticulture but is also threatened by habitat loss and overcollection."
