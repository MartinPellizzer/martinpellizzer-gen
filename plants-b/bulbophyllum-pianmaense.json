    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pianmaense, commonly known as the Pianma orchid, is a species of orchid native to China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators."
