    "intro": "Bulbostylis andongensis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Andong bulbostylis, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) surface, which sets it apart from other varieties of Bulbostylis."
