    "intro": "Botrychium crassinervium var. obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed moonwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological niche. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizome with a distinctive network of veins, and its fronds are divided into segments with broad, rounded lobes. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spadix-like arrangement on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptations to low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems."
