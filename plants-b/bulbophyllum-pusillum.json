    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pusillum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered pseudobulbs and narrow, strap-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often appearing in late spring or early summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for miniature orchid collections."
