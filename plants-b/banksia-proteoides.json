    "intro": "Banksia proteoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf banksia, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of yellow to orange cylindrical flower heads. The plant produces woody follicles that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia proteoides is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators."
