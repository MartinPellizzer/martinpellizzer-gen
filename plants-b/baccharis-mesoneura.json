    "intro": "Baccharis mesoneura, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that contains seeds dispersed by wind. Baccharis mesoneura is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
