It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruit is a small, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed. This palm is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the fiber derived from its leaves."
