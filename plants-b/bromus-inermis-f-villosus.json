    "intro": "Bromus inermis f. villosus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often have a distinctive hairy appearance, especially on the lower parts. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. This plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, where it can form dense stands."
