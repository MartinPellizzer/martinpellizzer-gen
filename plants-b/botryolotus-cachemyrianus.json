    "intro": "Botryolotus cachemyrianus, commonly known as the Cachemire snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
