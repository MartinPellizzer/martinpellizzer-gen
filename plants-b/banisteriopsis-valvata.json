    "intro": "Banisteriopsis valvata, commonly known as the \"Amazonian arrow poison plant,\" is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant is notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which have historically been used by indigenous peoples for making poison-tipped darts. Its botanical features include small, white or greenish flowers and capsule fruits that release minute seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in shaded, humid environments where it can thrive without direct sunlight."
