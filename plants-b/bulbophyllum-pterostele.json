    "intro": "Bulbophyllum pterostele, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and striking, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
