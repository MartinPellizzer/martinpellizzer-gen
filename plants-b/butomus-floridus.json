It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves that often float on the water surface. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is often found in marshes and ponds. Butomus floridus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
