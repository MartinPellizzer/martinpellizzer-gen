    "intro": "Boberella alkekengi, commonly known as the red onion, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus and is characterized by its distinctive red or purple bulb, which is used both as a food source and for medicinal purposes. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette at the base, while the bulb is the primary edible part. Boberella alkekengi is also known for its strong aroma and its ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
