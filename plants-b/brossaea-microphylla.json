    "intro": "Brossaea microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf brossaea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
