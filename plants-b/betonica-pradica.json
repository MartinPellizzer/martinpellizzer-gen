    "intro": "Betonica pradica, commonly known as lesser betony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Betonica pradica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
