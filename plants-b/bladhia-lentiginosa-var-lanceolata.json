    "intro": "Bladhia lentiginosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate bladhia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive dark green color and a rough texture. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
