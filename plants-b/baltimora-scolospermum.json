    "intro": "Baltimora scolospermum, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning, followed by a rapid closing in the midday heat. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing along sandy or rocky shores. It thrives in saline environments and is adapted to withstand strong coastal winds. Baltimora scolospermum plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
