    "intro": "Bryonia rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate bryony, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by orange, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating, and it thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
