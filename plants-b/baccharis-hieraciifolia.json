    "intro": "Baccharis hieraciifolia, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
