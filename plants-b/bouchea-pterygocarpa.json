It is characterized by its spherical, woolly leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the leaves and a distinctive fruit capsule that splits open to release seeds. Bouchea pterygocarpa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
