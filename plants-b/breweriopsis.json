    "intro": "Breweriopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, a process known as mycorrhizal symbiosis. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale green, are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Breweriopsis is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments like cypress swamps."
