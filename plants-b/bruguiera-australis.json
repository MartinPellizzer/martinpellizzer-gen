    "intro": "Bruguiera australis, commonly known as the Australian mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is a key component of mangrove ecosystems, often forming dense forests in intertidal zones. The plant has pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are thin and broad, adapted to reduce salt absorption and enhance transpiration. Bruguiera australis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms."
