    "intro": "Byrsocarpus maximus, commonly known as the giant waterwheel tree, is a large, woody plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its massive, buttressed roots and its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves that resemble a waterwheel. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a large, fibrous capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The tree is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and for its potential medicinal properties."
