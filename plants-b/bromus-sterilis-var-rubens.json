    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. rubens, commonly known as red false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its reddish-purple inflorescence and slender, erect stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
