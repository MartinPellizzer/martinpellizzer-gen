    "intro": "Bromus secalinus var. submuticus, commonly known as the soft brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its leaves are generally narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
