    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia var. paludosa, commonly known as the swamp banksia, is a variant of the coastal banksia native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. This subspecies typically grows in wetter, swampy habitats, often in coastal areas with sandy or clay soils. Its flowers provide nectar for honeyeaters and other native birds, making it ecologically significant. The plant is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes."
