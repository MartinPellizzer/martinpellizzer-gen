    "intro": "Bothriocline centauroides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Bothriocline centauroides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife in its native habitat."
