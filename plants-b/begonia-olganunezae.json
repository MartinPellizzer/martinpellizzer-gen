    "intro": "Begonia olganunezae, commonly known as the Olganuneza begonia, is a rare and unique species native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
