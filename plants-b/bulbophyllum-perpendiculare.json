    "intro": "Bulbophyllum perpendiculare, commonly known as the upright orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulb-like structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
