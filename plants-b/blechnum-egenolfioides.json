    "intro": "Blechnum egenolfioides, commonly known as the Egenolf's holly fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form dense clusters. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a finely divided, feathery appearance. Blechnum egenolfioides is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
