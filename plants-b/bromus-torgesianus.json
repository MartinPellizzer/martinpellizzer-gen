    "intro": "Bromus torgesianus, commonly known as the Torgese grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Torgese in the Mediterranean Sea. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Bromus torgesianus is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
