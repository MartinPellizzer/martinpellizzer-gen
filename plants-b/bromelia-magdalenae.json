    "intro": "Bromelia magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant features a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that can store water, a characteristic adaptation to its often arid habitat. Its flowers, which are typically red or orange, are borne on tall, branching inflorescences. Bromelia magdalenae thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
