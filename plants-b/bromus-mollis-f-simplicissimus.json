    "intro": "Bromus mollis f. simplicissimus, commonly known as the simple spike grass, is a variant of the slender brome. It is a perennial grass characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced inflorescence. The plant typically features slender, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered in a spike-like structure, which is less complex than the typical form of the species. This form is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
