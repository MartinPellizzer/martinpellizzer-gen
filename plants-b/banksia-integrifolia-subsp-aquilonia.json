    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia subsp. aquilonia, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that appear in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its flowers produce nectar that attracts nectar-feeding birds and insects. This subspecies is an important component of coastal heathlands and is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental value."
