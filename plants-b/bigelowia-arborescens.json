    "intro": "Bigelowia arborescens, commonly known as the goldenrod of the Arctic, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. Bigelowia arborescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators in its harsh environment."
