    "intro": "Blechnum triangulatum, commonly known as the triangular holly fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and making it a popular ornamental plant."
