    "intro": "Burnatia enneandra var. linearis, commonly known as the slender burnatia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are linear, narrow, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
