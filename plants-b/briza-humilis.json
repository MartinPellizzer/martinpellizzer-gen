    "intro": "Briza humilis, commonly known as the lesser quaking grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, arching stems that sway in the wind, giving it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are narrow and finely textured, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Briza humilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
