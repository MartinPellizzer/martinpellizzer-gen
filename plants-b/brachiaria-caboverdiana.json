    "intro": "Brachiaria caboverdiana, commonly known as Cape Verde grass, is a flowering plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, slender blades. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing a high degree of salt tolerance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Brachiaria caboverdiana is often used for erosion control due to its dense root system and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
