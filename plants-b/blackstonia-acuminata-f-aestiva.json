    "intro": "Blackstonia acuminata f. aestiva, commonly known as the summer blackstonia, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its lanceolate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
