    "intro": "Bulbophyllum brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a sympodial growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and a cluster of fleshy, strap-like leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated inflorescence bearing numerous small, greenish-white flowers with yellow markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
