    "intro": "Banksia floribunda, commonly known as the silver banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically pale yellow to cream in color. The plant produces large, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. Banksia floribunda is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with a period of dormancy during the dry season."
