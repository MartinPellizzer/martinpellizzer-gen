    "intro": "Bistorta vulgaris var. ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf bistort, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves. The plant features upright, herbaceous stems that bear clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its leaves are broad and lanceolate, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Bistorta vulgaris var. ovata is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
