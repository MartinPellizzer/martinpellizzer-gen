    "intro": "Boerhavia decipiens, commonly known as the \"false sand mat,\" is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, sprawling stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Boerhavia decipiens is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
