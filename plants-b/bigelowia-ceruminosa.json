    "intro": "Bigelowia ceruminosa, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often found in moist, temperate environments. It has a short growing season and is adapted to the cool climate of its native habitat. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role in New Zealand's flora."
