    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. lepidus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stems, typically bearing two to three flowering bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
