    "intro": "Bauhinia lamprophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and dry woodlands. Bauhinia lamprophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
