    "intro": "Botrychium obliquum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Botrychiaceae family. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a unique zigzag pattern in its fronds, which gives it its common name. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, umbrella-like structure called a sorus. Botrychium obliquum is often found in temperate regions and is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds."
