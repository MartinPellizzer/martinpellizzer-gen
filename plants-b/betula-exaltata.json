    "intro": "Betula exaltata, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and green underneath. The tree typically grows to a height of 15 to 30 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are alternate, triangular, and turn yellow in the fall before dropping. Betula exaltata produces small, catkin-like flowers and is often found in forested areas and along riverbanks."
