It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and broad, flat leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Bromus maximus var. ambigens is a perennial species that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings."
