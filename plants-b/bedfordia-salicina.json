    "intro": "Bedfordia salicina, commonly known as the coastal bedfordia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring. It has small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Bedfordia salicina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing coastal soils."
