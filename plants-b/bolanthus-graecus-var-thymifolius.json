    "intro": "Bolanthus graecus var. thymifolius, commonly known as Greek thyme-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves have a strong, aromatic scent reminiscent of thyme, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
