    "intro": "Bauhinia lorantha, commonly known as the flame tree or red bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flame-like leaves that are compound and trifoliate. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of bright red or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, leathery pods that split open when mature. Bauhinia lorantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions."
