    "intro": "Balanophora fargesii, commonly known as the Chinese ghost flower, is a rare and unusual parasitic plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant has a short, thick stem with a fleshy, often reddish root system, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is typically found growing on the roots of other plants, such as trees and shrubs, in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
