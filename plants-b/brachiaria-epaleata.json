    "intro": "Brachiaria epaleata, commonly known as silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray leaves and tufted growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. It has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds for dispersal."
