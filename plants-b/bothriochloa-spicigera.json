    "intro": "Bothriochloa spicigera, commonly known as spear grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves with a distinctive ridge along the midrib, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a compact, spikelike structure. It produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant in some regions."
