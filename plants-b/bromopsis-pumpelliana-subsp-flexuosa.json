It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, arching leaves that often curve downward. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
