    "intro": "Botrychium biforme, commonly known as the two-lobed moonwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Botrychium biforme is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
