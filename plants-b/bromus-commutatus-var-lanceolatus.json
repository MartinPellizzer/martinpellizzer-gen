    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceleaf brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, which gives it its common name. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
