    "intro": "Brassica oleracea subvar. humilis, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lobed leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are followed by round, green pods containing seeds. It is a diploid species with a genome size typical of the Brassicaceae family. This subspecies is often considered a wild relative of cultivated cabbage and broccoli, contributing to genetic diversity in the genus."
