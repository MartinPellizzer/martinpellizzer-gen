    "intro": "Balanophora aphylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its roots. The plant lacks leaves and chlorophyll, relying instead on its host for photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive, intricate structure. Balanophora aphylla is native to certain regions of Southeast Asia and is considered rare and endangered due to habitat loss."
