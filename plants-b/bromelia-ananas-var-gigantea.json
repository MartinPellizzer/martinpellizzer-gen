    "intro": "Bromelia ananas var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant pineapple plant, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, stiff, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a water-holding structure at the center. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with striking red and orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
