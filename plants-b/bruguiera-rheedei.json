It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests along tropical coastlines. The plant is characterized by its woody, buttressed roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Bruguiera rheedei plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
