It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that bloom in summer, consisting of clusters of bright red or orange flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are compound and often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a flat, woody pod that splits open to release seeds. Bauhinia trichosepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and as a street tree due to its rapid growth and showy flowers."
