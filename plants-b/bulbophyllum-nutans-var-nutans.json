    "intro": "Bulbophyllum nutans var. nutans, commonly known as the nodding bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically sword-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. This orchid prefers bright, indirect light and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance."
