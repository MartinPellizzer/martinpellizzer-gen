    "intro": "Bulbophyllum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of orchids native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Their flowers are often small and delicate, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of leaves or other natural elements. Bulbophyllum species typically have pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. They thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often found in rainforests or coastal areas."
