    "intro": "Batrachium friesii, commonly known as the Fries's batrachium, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Batrachium friesii is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
