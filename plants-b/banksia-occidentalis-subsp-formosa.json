    "intro": "Banksia occidentalis subsp. formosa, commonly known as the Western Australian banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flower spikes, which appear in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces cylindrical flower heads that consist of numerous small, fluffy flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a woody stem with a rough, flaky bark. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and scrub environments."
