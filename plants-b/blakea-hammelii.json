    "intro": "Blakea hammelii, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss. Blakea hammelii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
