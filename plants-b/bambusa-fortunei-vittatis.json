    "intro": "Bambusa fortunei vittatis, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a clumping bamboo species native to China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow culms that contrast with its dark green leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces or as a decorative indoor plant. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. The golden bamboo is relatively low maintenance, thriving in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
