    "intro": "Bartsia odontites var. simplex, commonly known as the slender bartsia, is a small herbaceous plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves and small, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This variant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on its host plants for nutrients. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant ecology and plant morphology."
