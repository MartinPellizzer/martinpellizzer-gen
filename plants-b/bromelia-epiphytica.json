    "intro": "Bromelia epiphytica, commonly known as the Spanish moss bromeliad, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees in rainforests. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves form a central pool that collects water, providing a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its vibrant, spathaceous flowers are typically red or orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Bromelia epiphytica plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity."
