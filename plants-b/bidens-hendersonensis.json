It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer, are composed of ray and disk florets, typical of the sunflower family. Bidens hendersonensis is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
