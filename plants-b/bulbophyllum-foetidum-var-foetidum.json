    "intro": "Bulbophyllum foetidum var. foetidum, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its striking, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a distinctive, sometimes unpleasant odor. This unique scent is believed to attract specific pollinators, such as flies or beetles."
