    "intro": "Bombycilaena californica, commonly known as the California milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion in arid environments."
