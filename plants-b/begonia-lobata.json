    "intro": "Begonia lobata, commonly known as the waxy begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are often lobed or notched, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes from both its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
