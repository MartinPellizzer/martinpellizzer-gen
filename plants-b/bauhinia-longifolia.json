    "intro": "Bauhinia longifolia, commonly known as the white bauhinia, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven leaflets, and its showy, butterfly-like white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Bauhinia longifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some regions for medicinal purposes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
