    "intro": "Bambusa textilis var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple bamboo, is a striking ornamental bamboo species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple to reddish hues on the culms, which become more pronounced in cooler temperatures. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are a deep green, adding to its visual appeal. It grows in a clumping habit and is relatively cold-hardy compared to other bamboo species. This bamboo is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to create a dense, upright screen."
