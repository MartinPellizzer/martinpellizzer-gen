    "intro": "Banksia villosa, commonly known as the silky banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are covered in silky, white to pale yellow hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Banksia villosa is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in its native ecosystem."
