    "intro": "Brachyotum huancavelicae, commonly known as the Huancavelica brachyotum, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry climate. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
