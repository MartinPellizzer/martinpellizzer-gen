    "intro": "Bassia dasyphylla, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in harsh environments. Bassia dasyphylla is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
