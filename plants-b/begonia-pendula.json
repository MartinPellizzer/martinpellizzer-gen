    "intro": "Begonia pendula, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white or silver markings. Its stems are flexible and can be trained to cascade from hanging baskets or shelves. Begonia pendula prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
