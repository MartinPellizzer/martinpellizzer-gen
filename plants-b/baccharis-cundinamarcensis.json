It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the high-altitude climate of its native range. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Baccharis cundinamarcensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
