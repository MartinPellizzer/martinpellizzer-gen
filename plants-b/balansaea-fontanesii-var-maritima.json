    "intro": "Balansaea fontanesii var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal balansaea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax, aiding in its adaptation to coastal conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune systems."
