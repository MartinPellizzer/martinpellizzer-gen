    "intro": "Brachycarpaea, commonly known as the narrow-fruit spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with small, alternate leaves and inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in cyathia. Brachycarpaea species produce capsule fruits that are typically narrow and elongated, giving the genus its scientific name. These plants are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
