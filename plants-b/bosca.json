    "intro": "Bosca, commonly known as the Bosca tree, is a tropical evergreen species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, bark-like trunk that develops a unique, flaky texture as it matures. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, citrus-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The Bosca tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
