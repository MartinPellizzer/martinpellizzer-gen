    "intro": "Blechnum squamosissimum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds that are covered in small, overlapping scales, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Blechnum squamosissimum plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
