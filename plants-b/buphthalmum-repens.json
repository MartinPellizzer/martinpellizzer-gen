    "intro": "Buphthalmum repens, commonly known as the wandering eye or creeping sunflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, resembling a miniature sunflower. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Buphthalmum repens is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through its stolons, making it a common sight in its native habitat."
