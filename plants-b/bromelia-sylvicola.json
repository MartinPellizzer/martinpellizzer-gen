    "intro": "Bromelia sylvicola, commonly known as the forest bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool to collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are typically broad and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Bromelia sylvicola plays an important ecological role by providing microhabitats for various invertebrates and amphibians."
