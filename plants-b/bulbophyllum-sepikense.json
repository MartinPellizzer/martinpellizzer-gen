It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually borne on erect, leafless stems and can exhibit a wide range of colors, including yellow, red, and purple. The orchid's morphology is adapted to its humid, tropical environment, with thick leaves that help retain moisture."
