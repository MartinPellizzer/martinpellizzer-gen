    "intro": "Benaurea, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Benaurea is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
