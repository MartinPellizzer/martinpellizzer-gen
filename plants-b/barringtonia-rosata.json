    "intro": "Barringtonia rosata, commonly known as the white cedar or night bloomer, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pendulous flowers that open at night. The flowers are white and emit a strong fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a spiky capsule that splits open to release seeds when mature. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty."
