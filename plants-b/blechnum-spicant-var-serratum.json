    "intro": "Blechnum spicant var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated harts-tongue fern, is a variant of the harts-tongue fern native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and serrated fronds that resemble a tongue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense, low-growing colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance in shaded garden settings."
