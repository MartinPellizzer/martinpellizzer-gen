It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils.
