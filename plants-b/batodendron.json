    "intro": "Batodendron, commonly known as the moonflower tree, is a unique plant characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit. Its flowers open only at night, releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that attracts pollinators such as moths. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources. The batodendron is native to tropical regions and is often found in dense, humid forests."
