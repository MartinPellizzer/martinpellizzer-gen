It features erect, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are characterized by their five-lobed structure and are often clustered in racemose inflorescences.
