    "intro": "Boniodendron, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a unique plant found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and long, drooping branches that give it a ghostly appearance. The leaves are typically small, dark green, and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Boniodendron produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, followed by delicate, translucent fruits. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
