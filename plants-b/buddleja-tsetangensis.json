    "intro": "Buddleja tsetangensis, commonly known as the Tibetan butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, Bhutan, and India. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, and is adapted to cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are typically purple or pink in color. Buddleja tsetangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
