It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which are covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
