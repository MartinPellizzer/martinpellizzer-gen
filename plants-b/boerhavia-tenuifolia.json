    "intro": "Boerhavia tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf bluishweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has thin, spreading stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and sandy soils. Boerhavia tenuifolia is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
