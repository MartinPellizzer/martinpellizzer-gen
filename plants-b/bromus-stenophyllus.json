    "intro": "Bromus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle with spikelets that are usually pale green to brown in color. Bromus stenophyllus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
