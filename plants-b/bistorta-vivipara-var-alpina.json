    "intro": "Bistorta vivipara var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bistort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of upright, lance-shaped leaves. The plant bears striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
