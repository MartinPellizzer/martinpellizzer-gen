    "intro": "Bidens aristosa, commonly known as the bristly beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is an annual herb that grows up to 60 cm tall, characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from July to September. Its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. Bidens aristosa is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions."
