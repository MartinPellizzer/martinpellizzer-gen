    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cornu-ovis, commonly known as the horned cow orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial epiphytic orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates. Its flowers are showy, with a unique shape that resembles a horn, giving it its common name. The orchid's inflorescence is often curved, and its blooms can be white, pink, or yellow, depending on the variety."
