    "intro": "Bacopa connata, commonly known as water bead plant or Indian pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue or violet flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Bacopa connata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water sources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it a popular choice for aquatic gardens and wetland restoration projects."
