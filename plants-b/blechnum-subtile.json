    "intro": "Blechnum subtile, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to New Zealand, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The fronds are usually evergreen, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in New Zealand's native flora."
