    "intro": "Byttneria leesonii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its hard, heavy wood, it has been historically used for furniture and tool handles."
