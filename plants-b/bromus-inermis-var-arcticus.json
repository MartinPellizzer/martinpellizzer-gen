    "intro": "Bromus inermis var. arcticus, commonly known as Arctic brome, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil in harsh environments and providing forage for herbivores."
