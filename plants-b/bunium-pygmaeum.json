    "intro": "Bunium pygmaeum, commonly known as dwarf fennel, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as parsley and dill. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with finely divided, feathery leaves and small yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in a bract-like structure and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Bunium pygmaeum is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands."
