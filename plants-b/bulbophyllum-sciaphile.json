    "intro": "Bulbophyllum sciaphile, commonly known as the shade-loving orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
