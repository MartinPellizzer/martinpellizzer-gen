    "intro": "Bromus avenoides, commonly known as the soft brome, is a grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned lemmas. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Bromus avenoides is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
