    "intro": "Bouteloua ovata, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to white flowers in late summer, which are arranged in loose, open panicles. Sand dropseed thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas. It is drought-tolerant and serves as a valuable component of native plant communities."
