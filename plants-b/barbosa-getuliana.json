    "intro": "Barbosa getuliana, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
