    "intro": "Badiera berteroana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in some regions."
