    "intro": "Begonia soror, commonly known as the twinleaf begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive pair of opposite, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often variegated with white or yellow markings, adding to its ornamental value. Begonia soror prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds."
