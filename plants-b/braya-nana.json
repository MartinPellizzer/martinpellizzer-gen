    "intro": "Braya nana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically has dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Braya nana is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
