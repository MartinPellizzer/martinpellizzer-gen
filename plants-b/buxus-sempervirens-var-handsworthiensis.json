    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. handsworthiensis, commonly known as the Handsworth boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the UK. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for hedging and topiary. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in spring. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, and it is relatively resistant to pests and diseases. This variety is often used in formal garden designs due to its ability to maintain a neat, sculptural form."
