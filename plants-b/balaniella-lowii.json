It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its often-dry environment. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care. Balaniella lowii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
