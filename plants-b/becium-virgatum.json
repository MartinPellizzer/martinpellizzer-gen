    "intro": "Becium virgatum, commonly known as the Virgin's thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, characterized by its spiny stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible when ripe, though they are often avoided due to the plant's defensive thorns. It is adapted to arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native environment."
