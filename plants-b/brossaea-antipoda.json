    "intro": "Brossaea antipoda, commonly known as the Antipodean brossa, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the remote South Pacific islands, where it thrives in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Brossaea antipoda is considered a rare and endangered species."
