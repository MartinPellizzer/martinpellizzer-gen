    "intro": "Buxus portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
