    "intro": "Baissea wulfhorstii, commonly known as the Wulfhorst's kalanchoe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
