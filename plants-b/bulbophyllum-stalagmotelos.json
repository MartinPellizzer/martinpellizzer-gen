    "intro": "Bulbophyllum stalagmotelos, commonly known as the stalagmite orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs that resemble stalagmites, which are often covered in a dense layer of velvety, dark green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
