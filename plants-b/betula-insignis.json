    "intro": "Betula insignis, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The bark is smooth and often peels in thin, papery strips, revealing a lighter-colored inner layer. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This hardy species thrives in harsh, cold climates and is often found in tundra and boreal forest ecosystems."
