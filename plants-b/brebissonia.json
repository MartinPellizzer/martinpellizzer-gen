    "intro": "Brebissonia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plants are characterized by their evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. Brebissonia species typically thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are adapted to cold, moist environments. Due to their ornamental value and ecological significance, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
