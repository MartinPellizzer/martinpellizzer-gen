    "intro": "Bentinckia nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar date palm, is a flowering plant species native to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compound inflorescences, followed by edible, date-like fruits. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid conditions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often cultivated for its ornamental and fruiting value."
