It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss through transpiration. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
