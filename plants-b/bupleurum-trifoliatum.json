    "intro": "Bupleurum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Bupleurum trifoliatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
