    "intro": "Borya nitida var. sublanosa, commonly known as the silky borya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in a dense, fine layer of silky hairs, giving it its characteristic sublanose appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a similar hairy coating, contributing to its overall textured appearance. Borya nitida var. sublanosa is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
