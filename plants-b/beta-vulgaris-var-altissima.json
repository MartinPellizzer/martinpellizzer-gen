    "intro": "Beta vulgaris var. altissima, commonly known as sugar beet, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that store a high concentration of sucrose. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The botanical features of this variety make it highly valuable for agricultural purposes, particularly in sugar production."
