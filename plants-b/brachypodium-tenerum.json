    "intro": "Brachypodium tenerum, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Brachypodium tenerum is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
