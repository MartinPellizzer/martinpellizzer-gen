    "intro": "Beta maritima, commonly known as sea beet, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in rocky habitats. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-purple in color, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its root system is robust, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging coastal environments. Beta maritima is also valued for its edible leaves, which are rich in nutrients and have a slightly sweet, earthy flavor."
