    "intro": "Bromus asper subsp. serotinus, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Bromus genus. It is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. This subspecies is an important component of native plant communities and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
