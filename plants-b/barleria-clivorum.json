    "intro": "Barleria clivorum, commonly known as the mountain barleria, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal areas. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Barleria clivorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
