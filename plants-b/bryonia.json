    "intro": "Bryonia, commonly known as bryony, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It consists of several species, with Bryonia alba and Bryonia cretica being the most notable. These plants are characterized by their hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The fruit is a spiny, orange-colored capsule that contains toxic seeds. Bryonia species are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and they are often found in dry, disturbed habitats."
