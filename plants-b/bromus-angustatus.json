    "intro": "Bromus angustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of dense, spikelet-like flowers, which are often tinged with purple or brown. Bromus angustatus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
