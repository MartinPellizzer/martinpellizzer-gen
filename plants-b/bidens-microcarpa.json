    "intro": "Bidens microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with prominent white ray florets, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Bidens microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
