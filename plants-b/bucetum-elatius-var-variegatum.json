    "intro": "Bucetum elatius var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive variegated pattern of green and white. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its robust growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils."
