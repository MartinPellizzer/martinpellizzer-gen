    "intro": "Bromopsis attenuata, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 1 inch wide and have a smooth, slightly hairy surface. Bromopsis attenuata produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by narrow, spike-like seed heads."
