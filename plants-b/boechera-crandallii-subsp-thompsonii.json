    "intro": "Boechera crandallii subsp. thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, glaucous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arid environments. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard species. Its small size and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
