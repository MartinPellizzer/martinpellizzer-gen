    "intro": "Bromus racemosus subsp. lusitanicus, commonly known as the Iberian brome, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a loose, racemose arrangement of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat diversity. This subspecies is often found in Mediterranean climates and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
