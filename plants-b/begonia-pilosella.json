    "intro": "Begonia pilosella, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
