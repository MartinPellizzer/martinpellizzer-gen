    "intro": "Bulbinella calcicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a small, flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southeastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in coastal and inland regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in some areas."
