    "intro": "Brachiaria echinulata, commonly known as hairy brachiaria, is a grass species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and dense, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
