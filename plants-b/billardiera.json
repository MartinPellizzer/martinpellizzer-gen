It is native to Australia and includes several species, such as Billardiera heterophylla and Billardiera incana. These plants are typically shrubs or climbers, characterized by their opposite, often hairy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The flowers are usually white or pink, with four to five petals, and they bloom in spring or summer. Billardiera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage and nectar-rich blossoms."
