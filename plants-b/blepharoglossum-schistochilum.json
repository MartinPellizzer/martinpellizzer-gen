It is characterized by its intricate, moss-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a thalloid structure, with a leafy stem and dense, overlapping leaves that give it a carpet-like appearance. It thrives in humid climates and is often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for pristine habitats."
