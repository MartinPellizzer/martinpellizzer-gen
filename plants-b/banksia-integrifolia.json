    "intro": "Banksia integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, cone-like flower spikes that appear in late summer to early autumn. The leaves are long, narrow, and leathery, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces large, woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the shoreline."
