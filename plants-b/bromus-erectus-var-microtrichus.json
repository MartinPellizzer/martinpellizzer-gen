It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are covered with short, fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. This variety is often found in regions with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils."
