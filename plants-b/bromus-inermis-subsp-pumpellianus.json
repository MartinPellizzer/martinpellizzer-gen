    "intro": "Bromus inermis subsp. pumpellianus, commonly known as the smooth brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Bromus inermis subsp. pumpellianus is valued for its use in forage and soil stabilization, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
