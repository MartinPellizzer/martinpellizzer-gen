    "intro": "Bulbine stolonifera, commonly known as the narrowleaf bulbine, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It spreads through stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, enabling vegetative propagation. This hardy species is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
