    "intro": "Bravocactus horripilus, commonly known as the hairy devil's backbone, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival during dry periods. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens and is considered a striking addition to desert landscapes."
