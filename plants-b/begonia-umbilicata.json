    "intro": "Begonia umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilical begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a central depression, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden beds."
