    "intro": "Bletia pratensis, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12\u201324 inches and produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. Bletia pratensis thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
