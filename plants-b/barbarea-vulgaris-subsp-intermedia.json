    "intro": "Barbarea vulgaris subsp. intermedia, commonly known as common rockcress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
