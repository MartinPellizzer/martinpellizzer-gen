    "intro": "Bellevalia maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silvery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Bellevalia maritima is often used in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
