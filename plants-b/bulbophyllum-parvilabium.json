    "intro": "Bulbophyllum parvilabium, commonly known as the small-lipped orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or white, with a unique labellum that is smaller than the standard petals. It has a short, stocky rhizome and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
