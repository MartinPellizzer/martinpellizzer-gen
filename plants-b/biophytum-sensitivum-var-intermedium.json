    "intro": "Biophytum sensitivum var. intermedium, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold inward and droop when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimuli. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique movement and rapid response to touch make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
