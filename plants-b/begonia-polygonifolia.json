    "intro": "Begonia polygonifolia, commonly known as the polygon-leaf begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its lush foliage. Due to its unique appearance, it is popular in horticulture and botanical gardens."
