    "intro": "Byrsonima ferruginea, commonly known as the red mangrove or *Barringtonia ferruginea*, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, reddish bark and its ability to exude a reddish resin, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small, clustered, and typically green or reddish in color, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
