    "intro": "Brandesia martiana, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to many animals. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats and is often found near water bodies."
