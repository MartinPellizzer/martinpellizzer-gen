    "intro": "Bobea elatior var. molokaiensis, commonly known as the Molokai climbing bean, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Molokai. It is a perennial vine characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptation to the island's specific climate and soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
