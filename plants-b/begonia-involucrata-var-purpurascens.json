    "intro": "Begonia involucrata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaf begonia, is a compact, trailing perennial native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that display a striking purple to reddish hue, especially under bright light. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and delicate floral display."
