    "intro": "Betula megaloptera, commonly known as the giant birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like inflorescences that are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
