    "intro": "Bryophthalmum, commonly known as the eye moss, is a unique genus of liverworts belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structures that resemble tiny eyes, giving it its distinctive common name. These plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Bryophthalmum species are non-vascular and rely on spores for reproduction, a common trait among bryophytes. Their simple morphology and specialized habitats make them important indicators of ecosystem health and biodiversity."
