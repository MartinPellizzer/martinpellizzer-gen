    "intro": "Bauhinia leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's bauhinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves, which are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The bark and leaves contain compounds that have been traditionally used for their medicinal properties."
