    "intro": "Bunias cristata, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a stout, ridged stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are wavy and toothed, with a distinctive crinkled appearance. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a dense, umbrella-like cluster called a capitulum. Bunias cristata is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields."
