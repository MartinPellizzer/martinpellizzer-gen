    "intro": "Betula pyrolifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins that are important for pollination. Betula pyrolifolia thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and taiga ecosystems. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
