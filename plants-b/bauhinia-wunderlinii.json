It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
