It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to grow in open, sunny habitats. Boniniella species are generally low-growing and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value."
