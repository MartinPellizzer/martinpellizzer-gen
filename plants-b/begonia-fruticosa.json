    "intro": "Begonia fruticosa, commonly known as the evergreen begonia, is a shrub-like plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features thick, waxy leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate, with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
