    "intro": "Bromus barbatus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned lemmas. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Bromus barbatus is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
