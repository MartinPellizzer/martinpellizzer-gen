    "intro": "Bassia convexula, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering the ground in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in dry environments. Bassia convexula is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
