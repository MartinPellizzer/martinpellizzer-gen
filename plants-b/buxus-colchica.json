    "intro": "Buxus colchica, commonly known as the Colchic boxwood, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Turkey. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that consists of small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Buxus colchica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate pruning."
