    "intro": "Braya marinellii, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. Braya marinellii plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
