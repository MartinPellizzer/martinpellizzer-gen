It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native habitat."
