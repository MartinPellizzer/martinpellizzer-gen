    "intro": "Bergenia tianquanensis, commonly known as the Tianquan bergenia, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and dense clusters of basal leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
