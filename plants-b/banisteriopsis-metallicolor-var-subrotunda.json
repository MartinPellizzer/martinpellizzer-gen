The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are small and yellowish. This variant is often cultivated for both its ecological benefits and its use in lightweight construction and artistic applications."
