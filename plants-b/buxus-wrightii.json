    "intro": "Buxus wrightii, commonly known as Wright's boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiaries. Due to its ornamental value and historical significance, it is also considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
