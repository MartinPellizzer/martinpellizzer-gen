It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and produces large, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for honeyeaters and other pollinators. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
