    "intro": "Burmeistera oyacachensis, commonly known as the Oyacachi burmeistera, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its humid, high-altitude habitat. It is often found growing in shaded, moist areas under the canopy of the forest. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
