    "intro": "Biscutella didyma var. micraspis, commonly known as the small-fruited biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
