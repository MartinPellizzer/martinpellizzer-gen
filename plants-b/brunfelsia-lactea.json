    "intro": "Brunfelsia lactea, commonly known as the white angel's trumpet, is a tropical flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faint milky sap. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Brunfelsia lactea is often cultivated for its ornamental value but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
