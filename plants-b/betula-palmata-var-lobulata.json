    "intro": "Betula palmata var. lobulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf birch, is a unique variant of the paper birch species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical Betula palmata. The plant is native to certain regions of North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to adapt to a variety of environmental conditions."
