    "intro": "Brassica maritima, commonly known as sea kale, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by round, green pods containing edible seeds. Sea kale thrives in moist, saline environments and is often found along shorelines and in tidal marshes. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal ecosystems and it has been used in traditional culinary and medicinal practices."
