It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in woodland areas. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation. The species is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar structural features."
