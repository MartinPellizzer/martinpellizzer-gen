    "intro": "Bursera silviae, commonly known as Silvia's frankincense tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Burseraceae family. It is native to the dry forests and scrublands of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark that exudes a resin when wounded, similar to frankincense. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by orange or red fruits containing three to four seeds. Bursera silviae is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
