    "intro": "Berula angustifolia var. gracile, commonly known as slender water dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found near streams, ditches, and marshy areas. The plant features slender, elongated leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in wetland habitats."
