    "intro": "Bartlettina brevipetiolata, commonly known as the short-stemmed Bartlettina, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with five petals. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and have short petioles, contributing to its common name. Bartlettina brevipetiolata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
