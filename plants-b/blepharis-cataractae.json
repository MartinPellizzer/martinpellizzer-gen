    "intro": "Blepharis cataractae, commonly known as the canyon blepharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, particularly in canyons and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
