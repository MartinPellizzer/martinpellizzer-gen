    "intro": "Betula papyrifera f. coriacea, commonly known as the paper birch with thick bark, is a variant of the paper birch characterized by its distinctive, thick, and furrowed bark. This subspecies is native to North America, particularly in regions of Canada and the northern United States. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a serrated margin and turn yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems."
