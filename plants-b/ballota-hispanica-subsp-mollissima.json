    "intro": "Ballota hispanica subsp. mollissima, commonly known as Spanish ballota, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces elliptical, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. The subspecies mollissima is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
