    "intro": "Betonica officinalis subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the alpine betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows and grasslands. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem, producing blue to violet blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, similar to the broader Betonica officinalis species."
