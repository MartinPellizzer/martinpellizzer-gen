    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tylophorum, commonly known as the orchid with the distinctive violet-colored flowers, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, where new shoots develop from the base of the plant. The plant produces intricate, fragrant blooms that are often clustered in racemes, and its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
