    "intro": "Begonia relicta, commonly known as the relic begonia, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and clusters of delicate, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and pink. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and historical significance make it a prized specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, Begonia relicta is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
