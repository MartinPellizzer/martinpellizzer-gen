    "intro": "Berberis tsangpoensis, commonly known as the Tsangpo barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas, primarily found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but typically consumed by birds. Berberis tsangpoensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance."
