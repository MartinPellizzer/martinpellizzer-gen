It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
