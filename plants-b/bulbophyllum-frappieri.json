    "intro": "Bulbophyllum frappieri, commonly known as the Frappier's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in seasonal environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
