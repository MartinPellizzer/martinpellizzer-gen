    "intro": "Bambusa virginalis, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow to golden-green culms, which distinguish it from other bamboo species. The plant grows in clumps and can reach heights of up to 10 meters, with slender, segmented stems that are hollow inside. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Bambusa virginalis is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant."
