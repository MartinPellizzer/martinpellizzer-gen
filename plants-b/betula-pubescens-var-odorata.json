    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. odorata, commonly known as the silver birch with fragrance, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark and small, triangular leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. Its aromatic leaves and bark emit a subtle, sweet scent, especially when bruised. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
