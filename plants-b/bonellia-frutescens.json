    "intro": "Bonellia frutescens, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky shores, often growing in brackish or saltwater environments. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, waxy texture to reduce water loss. Bonellia frutescens plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
