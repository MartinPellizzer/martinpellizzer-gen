    "intro": "Bursera velutinifolia, commonly known as the velvet tree or velvet leaf bursera, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, leathery, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by spherical, spiny fruits containing aromatic seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local cultures."
