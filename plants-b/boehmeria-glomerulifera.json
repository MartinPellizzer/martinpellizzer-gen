It belongs to the nettle family (Urticaceae) and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which give it its specific epithet \"glomerulifera.\" It is often grown for its fibers, which are used in traditional textiles and papermaking.
