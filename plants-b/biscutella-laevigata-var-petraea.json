    "intro": "Biscutella laevigata var. petraea, commonly known as the smooth biscuitroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard plants, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its unique morphology and habitat preference make it an important species in ecological studies of arid and semi-arid regions. The varietal form, petraea, is distinguished by its smooth, less hairy stems compared to the typical form."
