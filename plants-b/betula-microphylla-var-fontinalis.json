    "intro": "Betula microphylla var. fontinalis, commonly known as the western paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch species native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows in moist, cool environments such as stream banks and mountain valleys. Its leaves are small, triangular, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, supporting local ecosystems with its seeds and habitat."
