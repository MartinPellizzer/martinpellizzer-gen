    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval brome, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually glabrous. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-rowed flowers. This variety is characterized by its oval-shaped lemma, distinguishing it from other varieties of Bromus mollis."
