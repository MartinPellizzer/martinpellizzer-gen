    "intro": "Begonia leuconeura, commonly known as the white-veined begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy leaves with prominent white veins against a deep green background. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or red, typically appearing in clusters. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia leuconeura is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
