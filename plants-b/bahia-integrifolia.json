    "intro": "Bahia integrifolia, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bluish-green foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves with smooth margins. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for coastal landscapes. Bahia integrifolia is often used in erosion control and as a low-maintenance ornamental grass."
