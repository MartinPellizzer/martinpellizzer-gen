    "intro": "Bryonia tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender bryony, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and squashes, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Bryonia tenuifolia thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
