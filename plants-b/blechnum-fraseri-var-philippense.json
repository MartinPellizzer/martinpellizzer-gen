It belongs to the Blechnaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive holly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and the fronds are evergreen, providing a lush, tropical look. The varietal form, philippense, is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different frond morphology compared to the typical variety."
