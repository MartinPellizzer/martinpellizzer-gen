    "intro": "Blechnum stoloniferum, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant features lance-shaped, bright green fronds that are often divided into smaller, feather-like segments. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or along stream banks. Blechnum stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
