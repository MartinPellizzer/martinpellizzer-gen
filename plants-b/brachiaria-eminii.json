    "intro": "Brachiaria eminii, commonly known as the dwarf bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage, often forming a mat-like growth pattern. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained conditions. Brachiaria eminii is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
