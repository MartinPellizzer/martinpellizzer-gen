    "intro": "Besleria modica, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the small-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms in shades of white, yellow, and pink. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
