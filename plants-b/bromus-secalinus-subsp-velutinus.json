    "intro": "Bromus secalinus subsp. velutinus, commonly known as velvet brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Velvet brome is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
