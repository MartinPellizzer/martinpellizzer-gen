It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries containing several seeds. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a unique root system that has been traditionally used in herbal medicine.
