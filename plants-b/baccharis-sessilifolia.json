    "intro": "Baccharis sessilifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Baccharis sessilifolia is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities for its purported healing properties."
