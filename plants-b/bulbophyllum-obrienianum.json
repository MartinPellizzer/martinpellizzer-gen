    "intro": "Bulbophyllum obrienianum, commonly known as the O'Brien's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal dry periods. The flowers are often short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
