    "intro": "Banisteria calocarpa, commonly known as the red-capped beauty or red-capped banisteria, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support as it grows as a vine. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright color and nectar."
