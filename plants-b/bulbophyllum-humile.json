    "intro": "Bulbophyllum humile, commonly known as the small bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding substrate. This orchid is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
