    "intro": "Bromopsis indurata, commonly known as the hardy bromus, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often tightly packed, with small, awned flowers that are typical of the Poaceae family. Bromopsis indurata is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
