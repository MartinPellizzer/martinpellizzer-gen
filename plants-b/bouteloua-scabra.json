    "intro": "Bouteloua scabra, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its bluish-green foliage and rough, scabrous texture on its leaves. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Bouteloua scabra is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects."
