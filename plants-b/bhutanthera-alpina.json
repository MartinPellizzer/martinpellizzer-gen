    "intro": "Bhutanthera alpina, commonly known as the Bhutan alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Bhutan and northeastern India. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Bhutanthera alpina is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to alpine conditions and its potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
