    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. tunetanus, commonly known as the Tunisian soft brome, is a perennial grass native to North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, hairless leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience. This variety is closely related to other bromus species but is distinguished by its unique morphological traits."
