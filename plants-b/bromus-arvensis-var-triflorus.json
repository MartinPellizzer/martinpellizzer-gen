    "intro": "Bromus arvensis var. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces spikelets in clusters of three, giving it its common name, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a prominent midrib. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This species is notable for its adaptability and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
