    "intro": "Banksia marginata var. humilis, commonly known as the slender banksia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and cylindrical, yellow-tinged flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant produces woody cones that release seeds after a fire, a feature typical of many species in the Proteaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
