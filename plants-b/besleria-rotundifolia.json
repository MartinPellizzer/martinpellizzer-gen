    "intro": "Besleria rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf gesneriad, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are round or oval in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
