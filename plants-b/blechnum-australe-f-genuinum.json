It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and rocky outcrops. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and greenhouses."
