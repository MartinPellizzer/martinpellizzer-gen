    "intro": "Begonia chongzuoensis, commonly known as the Chongzuo begonia, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Begoniaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and vibrant floral displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-draining soil. Its leaves are often lobed or heart-shaped, and the flowers can range from pink to red, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
