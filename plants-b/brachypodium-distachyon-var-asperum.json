    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. asperum, commonly known as rough bristlegrass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, rough-textured leaves and produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability and genetic similarity to other Brachypodium species, it is also used in plant research for studying grass genetics and stress responses."
