    "intro": "Begonia brevirimosa subsp. brevirimosa, commonly known as the short-ribbed begonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often velvety foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in the summer. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
