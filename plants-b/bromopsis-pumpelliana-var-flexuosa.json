    "intro": "Bromopsis pumpelliana var. flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible bromus, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, flexible stems that often bend with the wind. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that helps it blend into its mountainous habitat. This variety is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soils."
