    "intro": "Bactris hirta var. mollis, commonly known as the silky palm or silky bactris, is a species of palm native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, round fruits with a sweet, fibrous pulp. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food. The variety mollis is distinguished by its particularly dense and soft hairy covering on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
