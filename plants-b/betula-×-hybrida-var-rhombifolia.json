    "intro": "Betula \u00d7 hybrida var. rhombifolia, commonly known as the Weeping Betula or Weeping Birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect. It features smooth, white to gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers, and its leaves are triangular to rhombic in shape, with a serrated margin. The small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that mature in late summer. This species is native to parts of Europe and Asia but is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
