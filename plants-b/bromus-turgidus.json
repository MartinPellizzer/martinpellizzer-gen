    "intro": "Bromus turgidus, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear spike-like inflorescences with small, awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Bromus turgidus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
