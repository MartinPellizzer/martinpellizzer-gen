It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom atop slender stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
