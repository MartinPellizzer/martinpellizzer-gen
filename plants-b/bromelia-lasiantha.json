    "intro": "Bromelia lasiantha, commonly known as the red-tipped bromeliad, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cavity. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, making it a popular ornamental species. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Bromelia lasiantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
