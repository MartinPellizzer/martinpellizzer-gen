    "intro": "Bromus villosus subsp. maximus, commonly known as the hairy brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, with awned lemmas that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in open, sunny areas. Its adaptability makes it a common species in both natural and agricultural settings."
