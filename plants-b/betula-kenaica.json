    "intro": "Betula kenaica, commonly known as the Kenaic birch, is a species of birch native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests. The tree has smooth, white bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges. Betula kenaica produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
