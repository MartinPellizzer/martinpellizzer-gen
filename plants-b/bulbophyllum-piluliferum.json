    "intro": "Bulbophyllum piluliferum, commonly known as the pill-bearing orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pill-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. Due to its striking appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
