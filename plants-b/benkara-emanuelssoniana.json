It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
