    "intro": "Bignonia populifolia, commonly known as the Mexican trumpet Creeper, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a vigorous climber with long, slender stems that can reach up to 15 meters in length. The plant produces showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often resemble those of poplar trees, giving it its common name. Bignonia populifolia is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
