    "intro": "Bondtia serrulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed pittosporum, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in spring. These flowers are followed by small, orange-red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Bondtia serrulata is often found in coastal and lowland forest environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
