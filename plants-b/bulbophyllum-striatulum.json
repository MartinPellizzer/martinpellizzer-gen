    "intro": "Bulbophyllum striatulum, commonly known as the Striated Paphiopedilum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, strap-like leaves and striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as flies and beetles. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
