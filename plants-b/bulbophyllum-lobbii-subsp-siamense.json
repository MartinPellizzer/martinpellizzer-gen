    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lobbii subsp. siamense, commonly known as the Siam orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its drought tolerance. This orchid thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
