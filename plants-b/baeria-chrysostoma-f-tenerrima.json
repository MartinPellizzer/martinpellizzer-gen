    "intro": "Baeria chrysostoma f. tenerrima, commonly known as the golden star bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble small bells, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-gray pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
