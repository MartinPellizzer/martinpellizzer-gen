    "intro": "Botrychium pusillum, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a small fern that belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a crescent moon, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Botrychium pusillum has a short, underground rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It is a rare and endangered species, often found in specific habitats across North America."
