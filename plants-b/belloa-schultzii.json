    "intro": "Belloa schultzii, commonly known as the Schultze's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude regions, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit. Belloa schultzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
