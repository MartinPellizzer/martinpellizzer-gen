    "intro": "Begonia trigonocarpa, commonly known as the three-lobed begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia trigonocarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
