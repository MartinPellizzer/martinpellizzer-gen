    "intro": "Buxus sempervirens var. rosmarinifolium, commonly known as rosemary box, is a compact evergreen shrub with dense, dark green foliage. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinct aromatic scent reminiscent of rosemary. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for hedges and topiary. Due to its slow growth and hardy nature, it is often used in formal garden designs."
