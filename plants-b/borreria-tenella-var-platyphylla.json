    "intro": "Borreria tenella var. platyphylla, commonly known as the broadleaf borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with narrow, often succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, round berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Borreria tenella var. platyphylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
