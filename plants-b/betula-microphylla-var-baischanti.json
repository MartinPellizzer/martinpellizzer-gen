    "intro": "Betula microphylla var. baischanti, commonly known as the Baischanti birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and pale, often peeling in thin, papery layers, a feature typical of the Betula genus. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils."
