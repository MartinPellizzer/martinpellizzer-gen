    "intro": "Bulbophyllum bryophilum, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique ability to grow on moss, which provides both moisture and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients. This epiphytic orchid is well adapted to humid, shaded environments in tropical forests."
