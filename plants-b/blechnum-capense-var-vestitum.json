    "intro": "Blechnum capense var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
