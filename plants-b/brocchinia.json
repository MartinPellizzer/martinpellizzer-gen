    "intro": "Brocchinia, commonly known as the \"humpback\" or \"cushion\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly the Andes region, and are known for their unique, often spiny, rosette-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Brocchinia species often form dense, low-growing mats, which help them thrive in rocky or sandy soils. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered at the center of the leaf rosette."
