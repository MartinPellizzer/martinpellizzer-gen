    "intro": "Bosea cannabina, commonly known as the Indian hemp, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its dioecious nature, with separate male and female plants. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated. It is known for its fibrous stalks, which have been historically used for making ropes and textiles. The plant also contains compounds similar to those found in Cannabis species, though it is not psychoactive."
