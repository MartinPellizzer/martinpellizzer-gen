    "intro": "Bellis sylvestris, commonly known as woodland daisy, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with a central yellow disc. The plant thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Bellis sylvestris is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
