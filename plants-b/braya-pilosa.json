    "intro": "Braya pilosa, commonly known as the hairy braya, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Braya pilosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun with minimal water."
