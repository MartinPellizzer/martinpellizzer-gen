    "intro": "Botrychium dissectum f. oneidense, commonly known as the Oneida moonwort, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are divided into small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered at the base of the fronds. The subspecies oneidense is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
