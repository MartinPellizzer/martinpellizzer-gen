    "intro": "Blysmus compressus var. elynoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf blysmus, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its low profile and drought tolerance, it is well adapted to arid environments."
