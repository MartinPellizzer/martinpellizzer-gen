    "intro": "Bikinia evrardii, commonly known as the Evrard's Bikinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bikinia evrardii is considered a vulnerable species."
