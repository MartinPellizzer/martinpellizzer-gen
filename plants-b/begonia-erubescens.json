It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins against a glossy green background. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
