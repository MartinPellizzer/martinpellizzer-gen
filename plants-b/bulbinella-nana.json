    "intro": "Bulbinella nana, commonly known as the dwarf lily or small bulbinella, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette at the base, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Bulbinella nana is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
