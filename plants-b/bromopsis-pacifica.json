    "intro": "Bromopsis pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific bromus, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of Oregon and California. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Bromopsis pacifica plays a vital role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various coastal wildlife."
