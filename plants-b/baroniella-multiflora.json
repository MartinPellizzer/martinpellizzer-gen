    "intro": "Baroniella multiflora, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a short, succulent stem and produces small, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Baroniella multiflora typically blooms in spring or early summer, producing bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
