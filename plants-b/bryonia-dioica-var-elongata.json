    "intro": "Bryonia dioica var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed bryony, is a variant of the common bryony plant native to Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by orange, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Due to its toxicity, it is generally avoided for medicinal use but has historical significance in herbal traditions."
