    "intro": "Bulbostylis hispidula subsp. senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese bulbostylis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It typically grows in wet, marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies, thriving in humid and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
