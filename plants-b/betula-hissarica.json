    "intro": "Betula hissarica, commonly known as the Hissar birch, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and smooth, white or pale bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are oval to triangular, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
