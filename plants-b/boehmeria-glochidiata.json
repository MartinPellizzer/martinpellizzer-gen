    "intro": "Boehmeria glochidiata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Chinese nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically found in the axils of the leaves. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its fibrous stalks, it has been used historically for making textiles and paper."
