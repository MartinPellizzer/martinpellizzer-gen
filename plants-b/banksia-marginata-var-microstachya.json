It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that are typically yellow to orange in color, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping."
