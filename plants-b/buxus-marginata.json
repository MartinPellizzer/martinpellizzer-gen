    "intro": "Buxus marginata, commonly known as the silver leaf boxwood, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with leaves that are typically bright green on top and silvery-white on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It is widely cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and ability to be shaped into various forms. Buxus marginata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for garden borders and topiary."
