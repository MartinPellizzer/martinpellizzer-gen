    "intro": "Brassica hispida, commonly known as the rough cabbage or hairy mustard, is an annual herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruits are cylindrical siliques that contain several seeds, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Brassica hispida is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
