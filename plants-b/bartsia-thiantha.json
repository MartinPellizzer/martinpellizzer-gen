    "intro": "Bartsia thiantha, commonly known as the lesser bartsia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a short life cycle that allows it to thrive in disturbed habitats. Bartsia thiantha is often found in association with other early successional plant species."
