    "intro": "Banksia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant produces woody cone-like structures called follicles, which contain seeds covered in a sticky resin. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Banksia glutinosa plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
