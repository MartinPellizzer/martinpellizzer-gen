It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh trees, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The plant typically has smooth, gray bark and produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by orange-colored fruits containing three seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Bursera nitida is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its use in traditional medicine."
