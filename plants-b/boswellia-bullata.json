It produces a resinous sap, known as frankincense, which is harvested by making incisions in its bark. The plant belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, leathery leaves. Boswellia bullata thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters. Its resin has been used traditionally for incense, medicine, and as a natural remedy for various ailments."
