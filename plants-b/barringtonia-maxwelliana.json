It is characterized by its distinctive, lantern-like inflorescences that hang from the branches, often appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by nocturnal insects and bats. Its fruit is a fibrous, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds.
