    "intro": "Batrachium trichophyllum subsp. drouetii, commonly known as the Drouet's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
