    "intro": "Braya humilis subsp. richardsonii, commonly known as Richardson's winterfat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. It produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are visited by various pollinators. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
