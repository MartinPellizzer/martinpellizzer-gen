    "intro": "Betula latifolia, commonly known as the paper birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a pale yellowish inner layer. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Betula latifolia plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
