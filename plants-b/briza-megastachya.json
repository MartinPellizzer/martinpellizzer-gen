It is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and slender, trembling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, feathery flowers that are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Briza megastachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
