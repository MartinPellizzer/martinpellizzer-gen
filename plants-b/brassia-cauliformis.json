    "intro": "Brassia cauliformis, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, cauliflower-like inflorescence composed of numerous small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. The flowers are usually pale green to white, with some varieties displaying subtle markings, and bloom during the wet season."
