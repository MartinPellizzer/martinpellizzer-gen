    "intro": "Begonia nervidens, commonly known as the veined begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with prominent veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia nervidens is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
