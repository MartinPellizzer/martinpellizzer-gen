    "intro": "Banksia aquilonia, commonly known as the northern banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically bright yellow or orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia aquilonia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
