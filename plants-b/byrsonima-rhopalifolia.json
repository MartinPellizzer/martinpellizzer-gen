It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible red berries resembling cherries. These berries are rich in nutrients and have been traditionally used in local cuisines and medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts in tropical regions."
