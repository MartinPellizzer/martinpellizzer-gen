It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
