    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tenuisepalum, commonly known as the slender-sepal orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulb-like structure and produces small, delicate flowers with elongated sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are elongated and slightly fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. The flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators."
