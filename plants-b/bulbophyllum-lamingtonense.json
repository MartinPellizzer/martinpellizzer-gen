    "intro": "Bulbophyllum lamingtonense, commonly known as the Lamington orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the subtropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, showy flower that blooms in spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange with a distinctive lip, and it plays an important role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
