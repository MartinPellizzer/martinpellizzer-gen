    "intro": "Buddleja grandiflora, commonly known as the butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that provide food for birds and insects. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. However, its invasive potential in some regions has led to its restriction in certain areas."
