    "intro": "Bondtia latrobei, commonly known as the Limestone lily, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. It is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry environments. Bondtia latrobei plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
