    "intro": "Byrsella murex, commonly known as the red sea urchin, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Brachyuridae. It is characterized by its spherical body covered in bright red spines, which serve as both a defense mechanism and a means of movement. The plant-like appearance of its body, with a central test and radial symmetry, is a key feature in its classification. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region. Despite its name, it is not a true plant but a member of the echinoderm phylum."
