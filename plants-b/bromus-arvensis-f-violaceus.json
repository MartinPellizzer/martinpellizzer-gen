    "intro": "Bromus arvensis f. violaceus, commonly known as the violet false brome, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields and along roadsides. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, violet-colored flowers. Its violet flower color is a distinguishing characteristic of this form. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies."
