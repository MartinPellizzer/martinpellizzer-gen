    "intro": "Bulbophyllum streptomorphum, commonly known as the clustered ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, translucent flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers, which are usually pale green or yellowish, are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
