    "intro": "Bromus secalinus f. submuticus, commonly known as the soft-leaved annual brome, is a variant of the annual brome grass. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and culms, which distinguish it from other bromus species. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields or along roadsides. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. The subspecies is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
