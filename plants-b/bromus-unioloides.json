    "intro": "Bromus unioloides, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each branch, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Bromus unioloides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
