    "intro": "Bulbophyllum chrysotes, commonly known as the golden bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. Its leaves are typically narrow and strap-like, and it prefers bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This orchid is popular among enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
