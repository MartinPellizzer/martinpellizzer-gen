    "intro": "Bulbophyllum conicum, commonly known as the conical bulbophyllum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, conical pseudobulbs and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
