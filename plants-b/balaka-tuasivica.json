It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, Balaka tuasivica is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Madagascar."
