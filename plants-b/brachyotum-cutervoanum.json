    "intro": "Brachyotum cutervoanum, commonly known as the Cusco nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or purple in color. It produces berries that are toxic to humans but are used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
