    "intro": "Bidens reflexa, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help in seed dispersal. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands and along roadsides. Its leaves are opposite and have a rough texture, while its seeds are enclosed in a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Bidens reflexa is an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in supporting local wildlife."
