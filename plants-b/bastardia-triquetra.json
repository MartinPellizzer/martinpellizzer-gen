    "intro": "Bastardia triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically triangular in shape, giving it its common name, and it is often found in disturbed or saline environments. Bastardia triquetra is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
