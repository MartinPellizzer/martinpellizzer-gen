It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in full sun. Brickellia stolonifera is also known for its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
