    "intro": "Betula davurica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a deciduous shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and grayish-white, often peeling in thin strips. This hardy species is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in tundra and rocky environments."
