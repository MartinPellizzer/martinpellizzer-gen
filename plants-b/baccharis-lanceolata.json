    "intro": "Baccharis lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing cones. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Baccharis lanceolata is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
