    "intro": "Bulbophyllum clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive lip structure. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. Bulbophyllum clarkei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral characteristics."
