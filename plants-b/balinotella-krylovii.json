    "intro": "Balinotella krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov's balinotella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, unbranched stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species with limited research on its ecological role and conservation status."
