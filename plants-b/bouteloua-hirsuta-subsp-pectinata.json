    "intro": "Bouteloua hirsuta subsp. pectinata, commonly known as the silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces loose, open panicles of small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
