    "intro": "Broussonetia billardii, commonly known as the Chinese hackberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often lobed or serrated. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. Broussonetia billardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
