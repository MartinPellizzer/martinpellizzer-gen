    "intro": "Barbarea auriculata var. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet, alpine environments. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive auriculate base, resembling small ear-like structures. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
