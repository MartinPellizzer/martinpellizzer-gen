    "intro": "Bursera simplex, commonly known as the white cedar or white bursera, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain three seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in limestone soils. Bursera simplex is also valued for its aromatic wood and has been used traditionally for medicinal purposes."
