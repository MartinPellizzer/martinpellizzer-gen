    "intro": "Biscutella foliosa, commonly known as the leafy biscutella, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its simple, often hairy leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. Biscutella foliosa has a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in arid environments."
