    "intro": "Berberis medellinensis, commonly known as the Medellin barberry, is a shrub native to the Andes region of Colombia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in humid, mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
