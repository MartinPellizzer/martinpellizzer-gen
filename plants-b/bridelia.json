    "intro": "Bridelia, commonly known as the \"butterfly tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Bridelia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite leaves and showy, often yellow or red, flowers. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Many species of Bridelia are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
