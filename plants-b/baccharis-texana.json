    "intro": "Baccharis texana, commonly known as Texas baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are aromatic and have a slightly resinous scent, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Baccharis texana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
