It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks.

The leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
