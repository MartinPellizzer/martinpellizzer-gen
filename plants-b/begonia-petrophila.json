    "intro": "Begonia petrophila, commonly known as the rock begonia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability to rocky habitats, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
