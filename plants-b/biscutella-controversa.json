    "intro": "Biscutella controversa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved biscuitroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Biscutella controversa is characterized by its distinctive root system, which is thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid conditions. It is also noted for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
