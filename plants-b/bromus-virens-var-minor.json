    "intro": "Bromus virens var. minor, commonly known as the lesser vernal brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
