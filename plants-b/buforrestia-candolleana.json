    "intro": "Buforrestia candolleana, commonly known as the candolleana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buforrestia candolleana is considered a species of conservation concern."
