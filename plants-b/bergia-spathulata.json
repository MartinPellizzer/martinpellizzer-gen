    "intro": "Bergia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaf bergia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. Bergia spathulata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
