    "intro": "Barberina celastrinea, commonly known as the purple-flowered celtis, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. Barberina celastrinea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
