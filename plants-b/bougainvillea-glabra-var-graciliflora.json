    "intro": "Bougainvillea glabra var. graciliflora, commonly known as the pink princess bougainvillea, is a compact variety of the popular bougainvillea shrub. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate bracts that display a soft pink to lavender hue, which are often mistaken for flowers. This variety produces smaller, less showy true flowers, typically white or pale yellow, nestled within the bracts. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening and small garden spaces."
