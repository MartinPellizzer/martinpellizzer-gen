    "intro": "Betula microphylla var. tumantica, commonly known as the white-barked birch, is a variant of the paper birch native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white-barked trunk and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its bark, which is smooth and white, peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
