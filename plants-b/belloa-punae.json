    "intro": "Belloa punae, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a flowering plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in cold, arid conditions, often found on rocky soils and coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom during the brief summer months. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in a harsh climate. Belloa punae plays a crucial role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for native invertebrates."
