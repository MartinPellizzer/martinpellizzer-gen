    "intro": "Bignonia vitalba, commonly known as yellow woodbine, is a climbing vine native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in woodland edges. Bignonia vitalba is notable for its rapid growth and ability to climb using its tendrils."
