    "intro": "Berberis swaseyi, commonly known as the Mexican barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical characteristics make it suitable for use in gardens and as a hedge due to its dense growth habit."
