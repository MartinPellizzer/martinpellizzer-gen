    "intro": "Buchnera aspera, commonly known as the rough bursage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green leaves and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces dry, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Buchnera aspera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its foliage and flowers provide nectar and pollen for various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
