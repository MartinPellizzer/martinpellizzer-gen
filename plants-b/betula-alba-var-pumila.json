    "intro": "Betula alba var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small shrub native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of less than 1 meter. The plant has smooth, grayish bark and small, triangular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and tundra regions, and is often found in acidic soils."
