    "intro": "Bidens venosa, commonly known as the common beggar's ticks, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated margins and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Bidens venosa is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
