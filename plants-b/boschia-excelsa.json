    "intro": "Boschia excelsa, commonly known as the tall sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Boschia excelsa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
