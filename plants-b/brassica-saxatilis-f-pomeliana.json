    "intro": "Brassica saxatilis f. pomeliana, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a horticultural form of a wild brassica species. It is characterized by its compact, rosette growth habit and vibrant, colorful leaves that range from green to red and purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. This variety is well-suited to full sun and is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardeners interested in drought-tolerant plants."
