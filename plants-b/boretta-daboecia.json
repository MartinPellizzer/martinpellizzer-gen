    "intro": "Boretta daboecia, commonly known as the Canary Island heath, is a shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. It produces pale pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Boretta daboecia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
