    "intro": "Bellevalia wilhelmsii, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of around 15-30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
