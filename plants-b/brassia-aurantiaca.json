    "intro": "Brassia aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive slipper-shaped lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat."
