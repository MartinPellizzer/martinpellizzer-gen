    "intro": "Bernardinia fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are small, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Due to habitat loss, Bernardinia fluminensis is considered endangered and is of interest for both its ecological and potential medicinal value."
