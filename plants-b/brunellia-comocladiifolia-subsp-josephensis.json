    "intro": "Brunellia comocladiifolia subsp. josephensis, commonly known as the Joseph's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles, where it grows on the branches of host trees such as mahogany and ceiba. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its twigs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
