    "intro": "Brunsvigia undulata, commonly known as the Cape bell or the African bell, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive undulating pattern on the petals. The plant produces a tall, spire-like stem that can reach up to two meters in height. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to rock gardens and coastal areas."
