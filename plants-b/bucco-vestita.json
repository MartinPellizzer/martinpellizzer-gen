    "intro": "Bucco vestita, commonly known as the \"cloaked orchid,\" is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, velvety green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bucco vestita is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
