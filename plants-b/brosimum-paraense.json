    "intro": "Brosimum paraense, commonly known as the Paraense rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used traditionally for various purposes. However, it is less commercially significant than other rubber-producing plants."
