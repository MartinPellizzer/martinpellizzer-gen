    "intro": "Begonia ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's begonia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It features fleshy, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green surface and reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
