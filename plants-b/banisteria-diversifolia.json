    "intro": "Banisteria diversifolia, commonly known as the coral tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, branching structure and clusters of small, bright red flowers that resemble coral, hence its common name. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banisteria diversifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant floral display. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical landscapes and botanical gardens."
