It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often considered bitter. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use."
