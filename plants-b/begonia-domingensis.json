    "intro": "Begonia domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican begonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Begonia domingensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
