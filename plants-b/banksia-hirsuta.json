    "intro": "Banksia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Banksia hirsuta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators."
