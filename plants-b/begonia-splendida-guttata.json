It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety leaves that often feature distinctive red or purple spots. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and shady outdoor spaces."
