    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. subglaber, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loose panicle made up of spikelets. This variety is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and drought tolerance."
