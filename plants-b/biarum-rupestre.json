    "intro": "Biarum rupestre, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in harsh environments, allowing it to thrive in areas with limited nutrients and extreme temperature fluctuations. Biarum rupestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
