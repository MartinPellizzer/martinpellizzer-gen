    "intro": "Bacopa myriophylloides, commonly known as water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically arranged oppositely on the stems, and it produces small, four-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bacopa myriophylloides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
