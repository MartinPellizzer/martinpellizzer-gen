It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive white stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense, compact clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
