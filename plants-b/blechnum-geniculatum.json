    "intro": "Blechnum geniculatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Blechnum geniculatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
