    "intro": "Beckmannia eruciformis subsp. borealis, commonly known as the northern beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Beckmannia eruciformis subsp. borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for herbivores in its native range."
