    "intro": "Bonellia verrucosa, commonly known as the hairy sponge or sea sponge, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its soft, porous body that allows water to flow through it, facilitating filter feeding. The sponge's body is covered in fine, hair-like structures called oscula, which aid in exhalation. It typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and can be found attached to rocks or other substrates. Bonellia verrucosa plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through its filter-feeding activity."
