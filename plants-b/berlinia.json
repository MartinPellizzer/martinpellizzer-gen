    "intro": "Berlinia, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, with some species found in Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. The trees are known for their dense, hard wood, which has been traditionally used for construction and tool-making. They typically grow as small to medium-sized trees, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often with yellow or white petals, and the pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals."
