    "intro": "Bowenia spectabilis var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated cycad, is a slow-growing, evergreen plant native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
