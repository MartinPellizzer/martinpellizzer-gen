    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kusaiense, commonly known as the Kusaiense orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks, often in shaded and humid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
