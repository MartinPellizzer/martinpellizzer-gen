    "intro": "Baeothryon alpinum, commonly known as the alpine baeothryon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters at the top of the stems. Baeothryon alpinum is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where other plants struggle to survive."
