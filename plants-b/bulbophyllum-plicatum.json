    "intro": "Bulbophyllum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pleated leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting purple or red lip. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without being parasitic. Bulbophyllum plicatum prefers warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
