It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
