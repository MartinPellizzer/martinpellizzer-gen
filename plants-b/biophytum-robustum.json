    "intro": "Biophytum robustum, commonly known as the African fireplant, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It grows upright, often reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, and is well-suited for rock gardens or containers. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
