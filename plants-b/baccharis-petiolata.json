    "intro": "Baccharis petiolata, commonly known as roughleaf baccharis, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, rough-textured leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a sprawling growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 feet. Baccharis petiolata is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
