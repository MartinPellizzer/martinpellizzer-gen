    "intro": "Bromus sterilis var. typicus, commonly known as the common brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
