    "intro": "Bryonia afghanica, commonly known as Afghan bryony, is a flowering plant native to regions of Central and South Asia. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and melons, and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces yellow, monoecious flowers and is known for its toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like bryonin. Its fruit is a spiny, orange-colored capsule that contains several seeds. Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments, though with caution."
