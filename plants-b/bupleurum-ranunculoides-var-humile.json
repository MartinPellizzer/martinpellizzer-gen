    "intro": "Bupleurum ranunculoides var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
