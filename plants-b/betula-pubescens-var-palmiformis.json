    "intro": "Betula pubescens var. palmiformis, commonly known as the white birch with palmate leaves, is a variant of the silver birch native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaf shape, which sets it apart from other birch species. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
