    "intro": "Bulga oocephala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It grows in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and sandy plains. Bulga oocephala is an important plant for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
