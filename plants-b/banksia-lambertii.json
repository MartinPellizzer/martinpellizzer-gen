    "intro": "Banksia lambertii, commonly known as the Lambert's banksia, is an evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically bright yellow and appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released after a fire, aiding in its regeneration. It has narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Banksia lambertii is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
