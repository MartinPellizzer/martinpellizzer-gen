    "intro": "Betula ermanii f. nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese paper birch, is a compact, slow-growing ornamental tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals a reddish-brown inner layer, giving it a striking appearance. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits. Its leaves are oval with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil."
