It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas.
