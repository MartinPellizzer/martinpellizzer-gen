    "intro": "Betula davurica var. tiliifolia, commonly known as the Siberian white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its white, peeling bark that reveals layers of pale yellow and brown beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are triangular and serrated, turning yellow in the fall. This species is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in reforestation efforts in northern regions."
