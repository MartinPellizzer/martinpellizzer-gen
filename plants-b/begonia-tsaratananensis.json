    "intro": "Begonia tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Madagascar begonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native ecosystem."
