    "intro": "Bryobium pullum, commonly known as the moss fern, is a unique plant belonging to the order Ptylodiscales. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that resemble those of ferns, despite being a moss. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, contain spores that are dispersed by wind. Bryobium pullum plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
