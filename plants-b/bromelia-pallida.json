    "intro": "Bromelia pallida, commonly known as the pale bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many ornamental and epiphytic plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for nourishment. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in a spike that rises from the center of the leaf rosette. Bromelia pallida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or in forest understories."
