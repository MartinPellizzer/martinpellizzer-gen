    "intro": "Batidophaca hosackiae, commonly known as the Hosack's batidophaca, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species and is protected in several states."
