    "intro": "Bigelovia setidens var. minor, commonly known as the small-stemmed bigelovia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of shrublands."
