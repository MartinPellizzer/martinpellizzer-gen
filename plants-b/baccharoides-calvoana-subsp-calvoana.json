    "intro": "Baccharoides calvoana subsp. calvoana, commonly known as the Calvo's baccharoides, is a shrub native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
