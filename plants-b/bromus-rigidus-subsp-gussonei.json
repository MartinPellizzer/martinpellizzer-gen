It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower-bearing structures. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
