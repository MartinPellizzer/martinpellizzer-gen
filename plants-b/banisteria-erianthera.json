    "intro": "Banisteria erianthera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, ovate leaflets and produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
