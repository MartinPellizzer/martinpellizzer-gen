It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodland or heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
