    "intro": "Begonia oblongata, commonly known as the oblong begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an upright herb with a short stem and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are glossy and have a slightly waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Begonia oblongata is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
