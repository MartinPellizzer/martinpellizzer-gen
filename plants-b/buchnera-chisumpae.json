    "intro": "Buchnera chisumpae, commonly known as the Chisumpa buchnera, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure. Its foliage is usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Buchnera chisumpae is considered a vulnerable species."
