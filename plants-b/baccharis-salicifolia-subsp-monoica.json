    "intro": "Baccharis salicifolia subsp. monoica, commonly known as the slender baccharis, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs in the spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators. The subspecies monoica is distinguished by its monoecious nature, meaning it bears both male and female flowers on the same plant."
