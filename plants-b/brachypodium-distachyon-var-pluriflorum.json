    "intro": "Brachypodium distachyon var. pluriflorum, commonly known as the multibranched false brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant produces multiple flowering shoots, giving it its varietal name \"pluriflorum,\" which means \"many-flowered\" in Latin. Its inflorescence consists of two spikelets, each bearing several small, spike-like flowers. This variety is often used in ecological studies and as a model organism due to its genetic simplicity and adaptability."
