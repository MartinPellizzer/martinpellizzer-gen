    "intro": "Blepharis marginata, commonly known as the silverleaf dwarf lantana, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, silver-green leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces vibrant purple or blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent-like leaves help it retain moisture, making it drought-tolerant. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability to arid conditions."
