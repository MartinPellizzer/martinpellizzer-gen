    "intro": "Bolboschoenus maritimus var. desoulavii, commonly known as the salt marsh bulrush, is a variant of the salt marsh grass known for its adaptability to coastal environments. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, forming a dense vegetation cover in brackish or saline wetlands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are robust and help in stabilizing the soil, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. This variant is often found in estuarine and tidal marsh habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of saltwater environments."
