    "intro": "Bothriochloa laguroides var. torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as canyons and slopes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps it conserve moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
