    "intro": "Bromus hookeri var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent brome, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy blades that give it its varietal name. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often subtended by a bract. This grass is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to high-altitude conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in rugged terrain."
