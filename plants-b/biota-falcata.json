    "intro": "Biota falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Biota falcata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
