    "intro": "Botrychium mormo, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a small, perennial fern that belongs to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium mormo is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various small organisms."
