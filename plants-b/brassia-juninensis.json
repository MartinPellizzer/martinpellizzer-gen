    "intro": "Brassia juninensis, commonly known as the Jun\u00edn orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators like bees and moths, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with good air circulation."
