    "intro": "Bulbophyllum melliferum, commonly known as the honey-scented orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that emit a sweet, honey-like aroma. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually elongated and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a combination of white, yellow, and green hues."
