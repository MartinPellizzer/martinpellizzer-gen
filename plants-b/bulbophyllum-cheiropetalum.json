    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cheiropetalum, commonly known as the golden lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophyte, meaning it grows on rock surfaces, and often thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a yellowish-orange coloration and intricate patterns on the petals. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in less-than-ideal conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
