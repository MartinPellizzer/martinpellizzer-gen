    "intro": "Botrychium pseudopinnatum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble tiny holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in small, cup-like structures called soruses, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium pseudopinnatum is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
