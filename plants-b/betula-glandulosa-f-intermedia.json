    "intro": "Betula glandulosa f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate birch, is a variant of the dwarf birch species native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its small stature, typically reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters, and its distinctive bark that is smooth and often reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are essential for wind pollination. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and turn yellow in the autumn. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, including wetlands and tundra, and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these areas."
