    "intro": "Bomarea glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth bomarea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, often tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial with slender, leafy stems that can climb or trail. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
