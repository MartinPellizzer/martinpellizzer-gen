    "intro": "Brachyscome diversifolia var. diversifolia, commonly known as the \"Blue Mist\" or \"Bluebell Bush,\" is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, sky-blue flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy inflorescences that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
