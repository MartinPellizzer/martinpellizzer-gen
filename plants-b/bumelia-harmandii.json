    "intro": "Bumelia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's bumelia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Bumelia harmandii typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of its family, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Rutaceae species."
