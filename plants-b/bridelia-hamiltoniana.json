    "intro": "Bridelia hamiltoniana, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange or red capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
