It is characterized by its helical growth pattern, where the stems twist around supporting structures. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. Its tuberous roots are often used in traditional medicine. Bomarea recurva is valued for both its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
