    "intro": "Brassaia klugii, commonly known as the Klug's bracken, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Brassaia klugii plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
