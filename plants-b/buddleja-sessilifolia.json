    "intro": "Buddleja sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf butterfly bush, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, often remaining on the plant throughout the winter in colder climates. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
