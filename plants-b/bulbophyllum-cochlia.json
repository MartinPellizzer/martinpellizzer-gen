    "intro": "Bulbophyllum cochlia, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are typically small, with a distinctive coral-like coloration, and are arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
