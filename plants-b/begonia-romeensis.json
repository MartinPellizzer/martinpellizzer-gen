    "intro": "Begonia romeensis, commonly known as the Roman begonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Italy. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
