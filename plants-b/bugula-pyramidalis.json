    "intro": "Bugula pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal bryozoan, is a colonial marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Bryozoa. It forms intricate, branching colonies that resemble a pyramidal structure, hence its common name. The colonies are typically attached to hard substrates such as rocks or shipwrecks in shallow coastal waters. Each individual, or zooid, is a tiny, filter-feeding animal enclosed within a calcareous or chitinous tube. Bugula pyramidalis plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to reef-like structures."
