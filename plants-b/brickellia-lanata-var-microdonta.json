    "intro": "Brickellia lanata var. microdonta, commonly known as the woolly brickellbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators."
