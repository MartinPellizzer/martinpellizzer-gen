    "intro": "Brunfelsia, commonly known as the angel's trumpets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, including parts of South America and the Caribbean. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, and the plants often have a fragrant aroma. Brunfelsia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, though some species contain toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care."
