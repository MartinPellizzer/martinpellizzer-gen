    "intro": "Braya purpurascens var. longii, commonly known as the long-stemmed cushion braya, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant features dense clusters of pale purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is distinguished by its longer stems compared to the typical form of Braya purpurascens."
