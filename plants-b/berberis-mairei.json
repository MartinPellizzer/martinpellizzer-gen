    "intro": "Berberis mairei, commonly known as the Maire barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a valuable addition to both landscape design and ecological restoration projects."
