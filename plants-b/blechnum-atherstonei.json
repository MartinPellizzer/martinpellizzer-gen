    "intro": "Blechnum atherstonei, commonly known as the Atherstone's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often leathery fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and remain upright, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
