It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique two-horned structure on its floral spurs. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its flowers are small and fragrant, blooming in spring and attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Bicornella is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
