    "intro": "Bromus giganteus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, pubescent foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike with spikelets that are often bristle-tipped. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
