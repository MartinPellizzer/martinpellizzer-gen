    "intro": "Bifaria garhwalensis, commonly known as the Garhwal bifaria, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Bifaria garhwalensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
