    "intro": "Bennettia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed bennettia, is a unique member of the Proteaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces woody, spiny fruits that contain seeds with a hard, protective coating. Bennettia longipes is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its growth is slow, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for specific wildlife."
