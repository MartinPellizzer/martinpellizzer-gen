It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often with distinctive spots or streaks. The plant features grass-like leaves that form a rosette, creating a compact, ornamental shape. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
