    "intro": "Bacopa occultans, commonly known as the ghost moss, is a small, creeping perennial plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, overlapping leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it a dense, moss-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist soil or aquatic environments. Bacopa occultans is often used in water gardens and bog landscapes due to its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
