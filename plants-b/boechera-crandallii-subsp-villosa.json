    "intro": "Boechera crandallii subsp. villosa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, foliage. It is native to the western United States, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Boechera crandallii subsp. villosa is a perennial herb that is often found in disturbed or open habitats, such as along trails or in dry meadows."
