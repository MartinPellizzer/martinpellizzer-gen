    "intro": "Bactyrilobium grande, commonly known as the giant bactrian lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant pink and white petals. The plant belongs to the Liliaceae family and is known for its robust, rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bactyrilobium grande is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
