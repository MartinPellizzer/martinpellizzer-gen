    "intro": "Baccharis nitida f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to South America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flower heads that are typically yellow or pale green, blooming in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
