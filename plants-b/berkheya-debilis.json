It features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Berkheya debilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
