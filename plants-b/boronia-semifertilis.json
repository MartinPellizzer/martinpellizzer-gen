    "intro": "Boronia semifertilis, commonly known as the slender boronia, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1.5 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its flowers are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance in its habitat. Boronia semifertilis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
