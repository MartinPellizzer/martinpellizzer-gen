    "intro": "Bulbophyllum steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's ghost orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. This epiphytic plant is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. It possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat with minimal rainfall. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Bulbophyllum steyermarkii is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
