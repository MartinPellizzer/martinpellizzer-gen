    "intro": "Bauhinia diphylla, commonly known as the flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, flame-like inflorescences that appear in clusters of red, orange, or yellow flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments, and its bark is typically smooth and greyish. Bauhinia diphylla thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
