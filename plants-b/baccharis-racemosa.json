    "intro": "Baccharis racemosa, commonly known as greenbriar or wild sagebrush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments makes it a common component of chaparral and desert ecosystems. Baccharis racemosa is also known for its aromatic foliage, which can emit a distinctive scent when crushed."
