    "intro": "Bulbophyllum tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features strikingly colored flowers with three distinct hues, typically red, yellow, and green, which give it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Bulbophyllum tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
