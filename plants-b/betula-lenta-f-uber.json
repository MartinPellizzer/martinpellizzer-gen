    "intro": "Betula lenta f. uber, commonly known as the sugar birch, is a variant of the yellow birch tree characterized by its distinctive white bark and smooth, pale trunk. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mixed hardwood forests. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark contains essential oils and has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes. The fruit of the tree is a winged nut that disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its natural range expansion."
