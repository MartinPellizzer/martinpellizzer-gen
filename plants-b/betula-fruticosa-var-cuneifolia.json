    "intro": "Betula fruticosa var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are typically elliptical in shape, turning yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, a common trait among birch species. It thrives in poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra or boreal forest environments. The bark of this shrub is smooth and light gray, with a papery texture that peels in thin layers."
