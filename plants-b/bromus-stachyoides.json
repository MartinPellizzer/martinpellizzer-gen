    "intro": "Bromus stachyoides, commonly known as the silvergrass or mountain bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with a pale blue or purple hue. Bromus stachyoides is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in regions with Mediterranean climates."
