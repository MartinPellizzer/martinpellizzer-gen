    "intro": "Bidens hyperborea var. colpophila, commonly known as the alpine ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lance-shaped with toothed margins. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
