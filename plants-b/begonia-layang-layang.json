    "intro": "Begonia layang-layang, commonly known as the hanging begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia layang-layang is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover due to its cascading growth habit."
