    "intro": "Borreria saxicola, commonly known as the rock borreria, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, helping it conserve water in dry conditions. Borreria saxicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
