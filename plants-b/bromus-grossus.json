    "intro": "Bromus grossus, commonly known as the rough brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky areas, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread in various environments. Bromus grossus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
