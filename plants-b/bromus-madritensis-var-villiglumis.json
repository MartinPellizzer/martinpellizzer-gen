    "intro": "Bromus madritensis var. villiglumis, commonly known as the Spanish brome, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets. It produces small, awned florets that are characteristic of the Bromus genus. This variety is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
