    "intro": "Bucida macrostachya, commonly known as the Brazilian beach tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub that thrives in sandy, saline environments. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Bucida macrostachya is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
