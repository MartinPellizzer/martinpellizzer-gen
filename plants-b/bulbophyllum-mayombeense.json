    "intro": "Bulbophyllum mayombeense, commonly known as the Mayombe orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
