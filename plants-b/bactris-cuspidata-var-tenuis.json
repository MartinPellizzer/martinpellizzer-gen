    "intro": "Bactris cuspidata var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender palm or narrow-leafed bactris, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves. The leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface, and they are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the top of the plant. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, elongated fruits that are similar in appearance to dates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its fruit, which can be consumed fresh or processed."
