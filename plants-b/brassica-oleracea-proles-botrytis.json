    "intro": "Brassica oleracea proles botrytis, commonly known as cauliflower, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, compact inflorescence composed of tightly packed flower buds, which are typically white, green, or purple in color. The plant has a short, stocky stem and broad, dark green leaves that form a rosette at the base. Its flowers are small and yellow, but they remain closed, contributing to the vegetable's distinctive appearance. Cauliflower is cultivated for its edible flower heads, which are harvested before they fully open."
