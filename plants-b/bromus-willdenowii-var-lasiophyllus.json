    "intro": "Bromus willdenowii var. lasiophyllus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system makes it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in disturbed soils."
