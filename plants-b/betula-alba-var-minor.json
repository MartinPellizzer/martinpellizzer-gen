    "intro": "Betula alba var. minor, commonly known as the silver birch variant, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, horizontal strips. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning golden in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
