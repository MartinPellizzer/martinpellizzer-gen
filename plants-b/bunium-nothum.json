    "intro": "Bunium nothum, commonly known as the common wormwood, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, pungent odor due to the presence of volatile oils, particularly thujone. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Bunium nothum is often found growing along roadsides and in open fields."
