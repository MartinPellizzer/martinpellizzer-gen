    "intro": "Biscutella spathulata, commonly known as the spoon-leaved biscuitroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It is often found in open woodlands and meadows at high elevations. Biscutella spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
