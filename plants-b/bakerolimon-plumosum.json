    "intro": "Bakerolimon plumosum, commonly known as the silky lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with a powdery or silky texture, which gives it its common name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rock surfaces. Bakerolimon plumosum is commonly used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
