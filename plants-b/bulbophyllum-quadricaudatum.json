It is characterized by its striking, elongated pseudobulbs and clusters of bright orange or red flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts. It is also noted for its ability to produce multiple flower spikes from a single pseudobulb."
