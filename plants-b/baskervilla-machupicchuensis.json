    "intro": "Baskervilla machupicchuensis, commonly known as the Machu Picchu orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy blooms that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing in rocky crevices at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
