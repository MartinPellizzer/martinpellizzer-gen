    "intro": "Blechnum spannagelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. The fronds are evergreen and remain throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
