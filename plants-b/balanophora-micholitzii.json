    "intro": "Balanophora micholitzii, commonly known as the Micholitz's orchid, is a holoparasitic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of other plants. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy, and often fragrant flowers, which are usually yellow or greenish in color. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
