    "intro": "Bromus hordeaceus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist environments. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This variety is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
