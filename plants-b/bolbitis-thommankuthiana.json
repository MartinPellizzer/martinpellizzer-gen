    "intro": "Bolbitis thommankuthiana, commonly known as the Kuthira Bolbitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
