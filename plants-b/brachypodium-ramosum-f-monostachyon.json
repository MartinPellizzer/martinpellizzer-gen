    "intro": "Brachypodium ramosum f. monostachyon, commonly known as the single-stem brachypodium, is a grass species characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced inflorescence. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant exhibits a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender spikelet at the apex of the stem. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are typically green or pale brown, and it is often found in disturbed soils or rocky habitats. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological simplicity and potential for use in ecological and agricultural research."
