    "intro": "Basselinia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its distinctive silver-colored foliage. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that gives them their silvery appearance. Basselinia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They play an important role in the ecological systems of New Zealand, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
