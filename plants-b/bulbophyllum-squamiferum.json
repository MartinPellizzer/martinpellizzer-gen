    "intro": "Bulbophyllum squamiferum, commonly known as the scalycap bletilla, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which is typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Bulbophyllum squamiferum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
