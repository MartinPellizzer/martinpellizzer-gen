It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, which bloom in early spring. Byrsella civilis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
