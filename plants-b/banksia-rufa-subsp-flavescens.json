It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences, which are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and the plant is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Banksia rufa subsp. flavescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in local habitats."
