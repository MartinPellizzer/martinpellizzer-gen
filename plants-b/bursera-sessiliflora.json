    "intro": "Bursera sessiliflora, commonly known as the Mexican birch or white cedar, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by orange or red fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. Bursera sessiliflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
