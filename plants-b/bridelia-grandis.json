    "intro": "Bridelia grandis, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Bridelia grandis is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
