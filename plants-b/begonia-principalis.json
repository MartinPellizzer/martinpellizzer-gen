    "intro": "Begonia principalis, commonly known as the velvet begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, often clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia principalis is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
