    "intro": "Buddleja striata var. zhouquensis, commonly known as the Zhouqu buddleja, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
