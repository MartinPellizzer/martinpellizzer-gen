    "intro": "Bulbine fallax, commonly known as the rock fig, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in rocky or sandy soils. Bulbine fallax is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
