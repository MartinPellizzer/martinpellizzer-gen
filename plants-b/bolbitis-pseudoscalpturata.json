    "intro": "Bolbitis pseudoscalpturata, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a rare and unusual member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often twisted fronds that resemble the shape of a sword. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are typically dark green with a leathery texture and lack the typical frond structure seen in most ferns. Bolbitis pseudoscalpturata is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as under dense canopies in temperate forests."
