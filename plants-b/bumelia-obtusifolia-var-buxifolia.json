It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that resembles boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The leaves are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a glossy, dark green upper surface."
