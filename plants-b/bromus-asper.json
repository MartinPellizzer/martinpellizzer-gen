    "intro": "Bromus asper, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, rough-textured leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of bracteate spikelets, which are usually green to brown in color. Bromus asper is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
