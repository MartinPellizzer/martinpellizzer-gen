    "intro": "Betula pumila var. typica, commonly known as the dwarf birch, is a small deciduous shrub native to northern regions of the Americas and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and along stream banks. Betula pumila var. typica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
