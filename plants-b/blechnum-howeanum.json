    "intro": "Blechnum howeanum, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are often dark green in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
