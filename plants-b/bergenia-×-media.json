    "intro": "Bergenia \u00d7 media, commonly known as the hybrid bergenia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Bergenia \u00d7 media is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and long blooming period."
