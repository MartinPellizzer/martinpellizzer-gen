    "intro": "Blitum glaucum, commonly known as silverleaf filaree, is a low-growing annual herb native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to summer. Its leaves are alternate and have a distinctive bluish-gray color due to dense trichomes. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
