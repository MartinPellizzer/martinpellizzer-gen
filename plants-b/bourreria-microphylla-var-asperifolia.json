    "intro": "Bourreria microphylla var. asperifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf burrbean, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, elliptical leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture on both sides, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Bourreria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain the edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its unique foliage and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
