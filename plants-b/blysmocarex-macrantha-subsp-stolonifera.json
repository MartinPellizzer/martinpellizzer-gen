    "intro": "Blysmocarex macrantha subsp. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes and help spread vegetatively. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
