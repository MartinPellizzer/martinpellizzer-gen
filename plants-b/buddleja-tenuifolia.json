    "intro": "Buddleja tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buddleja, is a deciduous shrub native to southern China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces fluffy, grayish-blue seed heads that persist into winter, adding ornamental value throughout the year. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Buddleja tenuifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
