    "intro": "Braya scharnhorstii, commonly known as the Scharnhorst's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are pale yellow and appear in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
