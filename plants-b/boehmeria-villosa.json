It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in both natural and cultivated environments. Boehmeria villosa is also valued for its fibers, which have been used in traditional textiles and papermaking."
