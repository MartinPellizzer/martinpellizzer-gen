    "intro": "Bulbophyllum niveosulphureum, commonly known as the White Sulphur Vase Orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive sulfur-like scent, which attracts pollinators. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and fragrance, it is a sought-after species in horticulture and conservation efforts."
