    "intro": "Belliolum rivulare, commonly known as the stream bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually pink or purple, and are clustered in racemes. Belliolum rivulare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
