The plant features hairy, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental value to the garden."
