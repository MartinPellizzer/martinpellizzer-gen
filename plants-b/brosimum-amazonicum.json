    "intro": "Brosimum amazonicum, commonly known as the rubber tree or baba\u00e7u, is a large, evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex, extracted from the trunk, has historically been used for rubber production. This species plays an important ecological role in the rainforest, providing habitat and food for various animals."
