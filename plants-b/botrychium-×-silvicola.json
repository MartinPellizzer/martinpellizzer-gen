It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its unique, moon-shaped sporangia that are clustered on a single stalk. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors, preferring rich, organic soil. Its fronds are usually small and delicate, with a distinctive, narrow, and often curled appearance. Botrychium \u00d7 silvicola plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
