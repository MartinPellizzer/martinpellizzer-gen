It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and produces showy, pale yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows as a tree or shrub, often reaching heights of several meters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal."
