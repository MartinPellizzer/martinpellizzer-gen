    "intro": "Bulbophyllum imbricans, commonly known as the overlapping lip orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its unique, overlapping lip that gives it its common name. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and fragrant, often in shades of white, yellow, or green. It is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
