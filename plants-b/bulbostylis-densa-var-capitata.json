    "intro": "Bulbostylis densa var. capitata, commonly known as the dense spike-rush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that forms a compact spike, typical of the genus Bulbostylis. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, grass-like leaves are arranged in a tight rosette, contributing to its compact appearance. The flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many Cyperaceae species."
