    "intro": "Bilderdykia dumetorum, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
