    "intro": "Batrachium peltatum f. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial staghorn fern, is a unique variant of the staghorn fern that grows on the ground rather than on trees. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that serves as a storage organ for water and nutrients. The plant produces two types of leaves: sterile, shield-like fronds that anchor it to the substrate, and fertile, spore-bearing fronds that develop at the base. Its growth habit is epiphytic in the wild but can be cultivated as a terrestrial plant under suitable conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
