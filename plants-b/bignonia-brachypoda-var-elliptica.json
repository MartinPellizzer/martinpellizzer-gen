    "intro": "Bignonia brachypoda var. elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf crossvine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, elliptical leaves that are typically 3\u20136 inches long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces orange-yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can grow up to 20 feet in length, making it an effective choice for covering trellises or fences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil."
