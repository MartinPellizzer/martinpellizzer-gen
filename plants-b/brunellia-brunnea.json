    "intro": "Brunellia brunnea, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
