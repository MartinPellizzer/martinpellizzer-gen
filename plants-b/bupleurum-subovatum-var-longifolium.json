    "intro": "Bupleurum subovatum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved bupleurum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant is often found in open, sunny habitats. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
