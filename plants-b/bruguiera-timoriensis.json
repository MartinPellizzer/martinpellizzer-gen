    "intro": "Bruguiera timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Indonesia. It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that help the plant breathe in waterlogged soil. The plant thrives in brackish water environments and plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. It has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Bruguiera timoriensis is also important for its ability to filter pollutants and support diverse marine and terrestrial life."
