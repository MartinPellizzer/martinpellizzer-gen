    "intro": "Banksia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the yellow banksia, is a species of shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow cylindrical flower spikes, which appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. Its woody, fire-resistant structure allows it to survive in the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Banksia sphaerocarpa plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing nectar for a variety of native birds and insects."
