    "intro": "Botrychium pumicola, commonly known as the pumice fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, two-part frond structure, with the upper portion resembling a rosette and the lower part forming a spore-producing structure. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky or pumice substrates. Its spores are released from the lower frond, which is covered in a specialized, cup-like structure called a sorus. Botrychium pumicola is a rare and often overlooked species, highlighting the diversity within the fern flora."
