    "intro": "Baccharis deltoidea, commonly known as delta baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, deltoid-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. It has a woody stem and produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Baccharis deltoidea is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
