    "intro": "Bromelica subulata, commonly known as the silver pineapple, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spire-like inflorescence adorned with vibrant orange bracts. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Bromelica subulata is also noted for its ability to produce edible fruits, though they are not as commonly consumed as those of the more familiar pineapple species."
