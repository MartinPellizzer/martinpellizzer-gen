    "intro": "Biasolettia glaberrima, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
