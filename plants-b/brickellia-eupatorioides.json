It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, sky-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
