    "intro": "Baccharis subbimera, commonly known as silverleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which provides a striking visual contrast against its green stems and branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and adaptability to arid conditions make it a valuable plant in native plant gardens."
