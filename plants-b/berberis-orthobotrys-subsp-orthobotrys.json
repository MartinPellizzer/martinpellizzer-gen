It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
