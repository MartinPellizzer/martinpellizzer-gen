    "intro": "Bonyunia cinchonoides, commonly known as the Malabar quinine plant, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes. It is known for containing alkaloids similar to quinine, which has historically been of interest for medicinal purposes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
