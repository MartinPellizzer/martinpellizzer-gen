    "intro": "Bromus commutatus var. neglectus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. This variety is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to drought conditions."
