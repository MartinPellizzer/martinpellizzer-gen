    "intro": "Bromus cebadilla, commonly known as the Spanish needle or goat's beard, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff, which are easily dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Bromus cebadilla is noted for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
