    "intro": "Bromelia sagenaria, commonly known as the red-tipped bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central reservoir to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often with a yellow or green bract. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Bromelia sagenaria is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
