    "intro": "Betula apoiensis, commonly known as the Apoi birch, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and smooth, white to pale gray bark that peels in thin layers. The leaves are triangular, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal visual appeal. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is adapted to cold, harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous soils."
