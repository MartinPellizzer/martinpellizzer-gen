It features upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage that becomes glabrous as the plant matures. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with showy, bilaterally symmetrical petals in shades of red, pink, or white. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in shaded environments."
