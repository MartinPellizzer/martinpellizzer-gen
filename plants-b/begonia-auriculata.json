    "intro": "Begonia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped begonia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that resemble small ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Begonia auriculata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
