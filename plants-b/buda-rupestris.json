    "intro": "Buda rupestris, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in dry climates."
