    "intro": "Beloperone pansamalana, commonly known as the Malagasy star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, thriving in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Beloperone pansamalana is considered a critically endangered species."
