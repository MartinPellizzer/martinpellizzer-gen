    "intro": "Bruniera vivipara, commonly known as the live-bearing bellflower, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in late spring. The plant is notable for its vivipary, a reproductive strategy where the seeds germinate while still enclosed within the fruit, allowing for rapid establishment of new plants. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette, adapted to conserve moisture in its often harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Bruniera vivipara is considered a vulnerable species."
