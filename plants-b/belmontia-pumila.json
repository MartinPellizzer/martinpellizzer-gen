    "intro": "Belmontia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf belmontia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Belmontia pumila thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden landscaping in warm climates."
