It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, fluffy white flowers that bloom in spring. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release cotton-like fibers, which are used in various traditional and industrial applications. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a broad, spreading canopy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often planted for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
