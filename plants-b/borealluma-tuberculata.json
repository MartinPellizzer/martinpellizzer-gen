    "intro": "Borealluma tuberculata, commonly known as the roughleaf panicled grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Borealluma tuberculata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
