    "intro": "Bassia costata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features silver-gray foliage with prominent leaf margins, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Bassia costata is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
