It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing a single flowering lemma. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
