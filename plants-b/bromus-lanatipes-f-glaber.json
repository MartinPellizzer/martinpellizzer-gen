    "intro": "Bromus lanatipes f. glaber, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green blades. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Bromus lanatipes f. glaber is often used in forage production and soil stabilization due to its hardiness and rapid establishment."
