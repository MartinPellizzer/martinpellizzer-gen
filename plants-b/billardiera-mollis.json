    "intro": "Billardiera mollis, commonly known as the soft-flowered mistletoe, is a climbing shrub native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Billardiera mollis is also notable for its ability to form aerial roots, which help it climb and anchor itself to trees."
