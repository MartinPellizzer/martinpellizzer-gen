    "intro": "Breweria rosea, commonly known as the rose moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright green, scalloped leaves that often have a reddish tinge. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are rarely seen, as it reproduces primarily through spores. Breweria rosea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
