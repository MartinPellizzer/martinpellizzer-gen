    "intro": "Berberis ehrenbergii, commonly known as the Mexican barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for ornamental gardening. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and seasonal flowering."
