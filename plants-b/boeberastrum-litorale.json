    "intro": "Boeberastrum litorale, commonly known as the coastal sedge, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wet, sandy soils along the edges of tidal marshes and estuaries. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, which helps stabilize shorelines. Boeberastrum litorale plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
