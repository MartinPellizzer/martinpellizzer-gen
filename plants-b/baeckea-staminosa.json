It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its narrow, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense inflorescences at the ends of the branches. Its flowers are often visited by insects, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological interactions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
