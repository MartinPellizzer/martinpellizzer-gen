It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped pseudobulbs and intricate, feather-like petals. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot.
