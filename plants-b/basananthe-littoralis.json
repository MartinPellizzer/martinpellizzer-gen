    "intro": "Basananthe littoralis, commonly known as the coastal banana plant, is a tropical species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible, banana-like fruits. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near the shoreline and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Due to its adaptability to saline environments, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
