    "intro": "Banksia lanata, commonly known as the Christmas bush, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and its distinctive flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody follicles that contain seeds, which are released when the follicles dry and open. Banksia lanata is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in its ecosystem. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping."
