The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are usually dark green and strap-shaped, arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. This orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
