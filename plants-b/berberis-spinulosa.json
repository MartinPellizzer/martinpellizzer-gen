    "intro": "Berberis spinulosa, commonly known as the thorny barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, spiny branches and small, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. Berberis spinulosa is also noted for its medicinal properties, with its roots containing berberine, a compound used in traditional medicine."
