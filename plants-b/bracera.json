    "intro": "Bracera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Bracera thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in tropical regions."
