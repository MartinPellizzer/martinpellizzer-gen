    "intro": "Brachypodium phoenicoides var. brevisetum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its fibrous root system and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in various environmental conditions."
