    "intro": "Bletia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, often pale or greenish flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Bletia species have a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
