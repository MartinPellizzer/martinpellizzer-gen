    "intro": "Begonia fulgens, commonly known as the fiery begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow centers. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are usually dark green, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Begonia fulgens is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds due to its preference for moist, humid environments."
