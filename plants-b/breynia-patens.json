It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Breynia patens is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
