    "intro": "Billbergia nana, commonly known as the dwarf billbergia, is a compact bromeliad native to South America. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Billbergia nana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
