    "intro": "Bombax blancoanum, commonly known as the white silk cotton tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, which bloom in the early morning. The tree produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds encased in a woody capsule, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a velvety texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for its fiber, though it is not as economically significant as other Bombax species."
