    "intro": "Biscutella megalocarpa, commonly known as the giant capsule biscuitplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that remain on the plant for an extended period, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
