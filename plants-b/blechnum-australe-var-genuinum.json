    "intro": "Blechnum australe var. genuinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to southeastern Australia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understoreys. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
