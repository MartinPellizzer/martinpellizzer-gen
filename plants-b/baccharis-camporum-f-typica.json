It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, dark green leaves that are oppositely arranged. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Additionally, it has some historical use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
