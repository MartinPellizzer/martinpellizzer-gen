    "intro": "Botryanthus odorus var. compactus, commonly known as the compact sweetshrub, is a dense, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for small garden spaces or as a border plant."
