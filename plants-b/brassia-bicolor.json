    "intro": "Brassia bicolor, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that resemble a slipper, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. Brassia bicolor is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
