It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, slender florets. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
