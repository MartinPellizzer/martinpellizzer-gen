    "intro": "Blechnum gueinzii, commonly known as the Gueinzi's harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Blechnaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often described as resembling a harts-tongue. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories."
