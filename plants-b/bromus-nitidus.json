    "intro": "Bromus nitidus, commonly known as the smooth brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and is often used in erosion control and forage production. Bromus nitidus is also a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens."
