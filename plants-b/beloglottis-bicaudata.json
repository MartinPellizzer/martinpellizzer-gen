    "intro": "Beloglottis bicaudata, commonly known as the two-tailed fern, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, dichotomous branching pattern that gives it its common name. The plant features long, slender fronds with a distinctive two-tailed appearance, and its leaves are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
