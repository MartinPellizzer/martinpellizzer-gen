It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for decorative purposes in gardens and as a houseplant."
