    "intro": "Betula kweichowensis, commonly known as the Yunnan birch, is a deciduous tree native to China, particularly found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in thin layers, revealing a lighter inner bark. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by triangular, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are oval-shaped, serrated, and turn yellow in the fall. Betula kweichowensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ecological and aesthetic significance."
