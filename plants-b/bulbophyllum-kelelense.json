    "intro": "Bulbophyllum kelelense, commonly known as the Kelele orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually elongated and grass-like, while its inflorescence bears clusters of small, colorful flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
