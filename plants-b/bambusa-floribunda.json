    "intro": "Bambusa floribunda, commonly known as the golden bamboo, is a striking ornamental grass native to Southeast Asia. It features tall, slender stalks that are often tinged with a yellow or golden hue, especially under certain light conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, adding an elegant touch to its appearance. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a glossy surface that enhances its visual appeal in gardens. Bambusa floribunda is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun exposure."
