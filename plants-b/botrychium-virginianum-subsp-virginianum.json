    "intro": "Botrychium virginianum subsp. virginianum, commonly known as the common moonwort, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into two distinct parts: a fertile lower portion and a sterile upper portion. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a dense, club-like formation on the underside of the fronds. Botrychium virginianum subsp. virginianum is often found in the eastern United States and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance."
