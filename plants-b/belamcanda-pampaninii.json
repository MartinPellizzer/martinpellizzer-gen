    "intro": "Belamcanda pampaninii, commonly known as the Indian golden lily, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of India and Southeast Asia. It features showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has strap-like, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wetland environments. Belamcanda pampaninii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in folk medicine."
