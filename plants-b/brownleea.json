It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plants typically have showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting throat. They are characterized by their woody stems and palmate leaves, which are often hairy or glandular. Brownleea species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
