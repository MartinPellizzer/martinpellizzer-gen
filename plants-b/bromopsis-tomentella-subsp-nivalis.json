    "intro": "Bromopsis tomentella subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the snow moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, pale green or yellowish spikelets that are typically inconspicuous. Bromopsis tomentella subsp. nivalis is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is often found in rocky or barren soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
