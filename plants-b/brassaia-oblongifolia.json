    "intro": "Brassaia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces vibrant pink or red blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Brassaia oblongifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and floral display."
