It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its finely toothed, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered catkins and has smooth, white bark that peels in thin, papery strips. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its ecological value includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
