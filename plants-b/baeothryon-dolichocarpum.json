    "intro": "Baeothryon dolichocarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The fruit is a distinctive, elongated capsule that contains the seeds, contributing to its adaptation to dry habitats."
