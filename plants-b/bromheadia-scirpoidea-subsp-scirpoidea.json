    "intro": "Bromheadia scirpoidea subsp. scirpoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bromheadia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is a terrestrial bromeliad characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its inflorescence produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in a spike. The species is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil and Argentina."
