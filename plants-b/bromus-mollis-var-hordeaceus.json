    "intro": "Bromus mollis var. hordeaceus, commonly known as the hairy vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and open woodlands. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
