It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
