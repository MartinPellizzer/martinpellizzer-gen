It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are typically orange or yellow in color. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces small, pale flowers. It is often considered a wild relative of the domesticated sweet potato, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs. Its botanical structure and growth habits make it an important subject in studies related to plant genetics and agriculture."
