    "intro": "Bicornella clarae, commonly known as the white-flowered bicornellia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Bicornella clarae is considered endangered in its natural range."
