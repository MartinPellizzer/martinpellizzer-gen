    "intro": "Begonia \u00d7 marmorea, commonly known as the marble queen begonia, is a hybrid plant prized for its striking foliage. Its leaves are velvety and feature a mottled pattern of green, white, and pink, resembling marble. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America and thrives in warm, humid environments. It produces small, tubular flowers in shades of red or orange, though these are often less showy than the leaves. Begonia \u00d7 marmorea is typically grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its sensitivity to direct sunlight."
