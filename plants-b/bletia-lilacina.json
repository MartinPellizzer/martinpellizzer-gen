    "intro": "Bletia lilacina, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, and has fleshy, strap-like leaves. Bletia lilacina is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Its flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
