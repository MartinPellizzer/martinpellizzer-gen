    "intro": "Brintonia, commonly known as the \"false holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bixaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Brintonia species are characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers that often have a striking red or orange color. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, and their fruits are capsules that release seeds when mature. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in botanical gardens and as landscape plants."
