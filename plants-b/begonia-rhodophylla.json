    "intro": "Begonia rhodophylla, commonly known as the red-leaf begonia, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red foliage that contrasts with its delicate, pale green stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
