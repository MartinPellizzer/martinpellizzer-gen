    "intro": "Berberis griffithii, commonly known as the Himalayan barberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features thorny stems and lance-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate climates."
