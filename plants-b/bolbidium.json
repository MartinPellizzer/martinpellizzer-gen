These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, often pink or purple flowers. Bolbidium species are perennial herbs with palmately lobed leaves and produce small, clustered fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, such as Bolbidium hirsutum and Bolbidium ramosum, which are native to Europe and western Asia."
