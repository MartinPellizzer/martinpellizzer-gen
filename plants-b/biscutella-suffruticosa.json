    "intro": "Biscutella suffruticosa, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It has small, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is well adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Biscutella suffruticosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
