    "intro": "Brosimum gaudichaudii f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf breadfruit, is a variant of the breadfruit tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smaller, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, round fruits resembling breadfruit. The fruit has a fibrous texture and a mild, sweet flavor when ripe. It is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal in warm climates."
