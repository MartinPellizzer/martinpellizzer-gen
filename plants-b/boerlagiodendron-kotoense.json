It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth surface. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
