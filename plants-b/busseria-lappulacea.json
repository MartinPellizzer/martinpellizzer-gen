    "intro": "Busseria lappulacea, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Busseria lappulacea plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important part of the flora in its native ecosystems."
