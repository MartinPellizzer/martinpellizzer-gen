    "intro": "Brickellia wrightii, commonly known as Wright's brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are typically clustered in dense, branched inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
