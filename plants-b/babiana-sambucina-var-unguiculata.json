    "intro": "Babiana sambucina var. unguiculata, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, spiky inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its bold, architectural appearance and long-lasting blooms. While it is relatively drought-tolerant, it benefits from regular watering during its active growing season."
