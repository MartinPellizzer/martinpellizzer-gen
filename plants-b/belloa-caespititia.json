    "intro": "Belloa caespititia, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features compact, succulent-like rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that help it store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
