    "intro": "Bolbidium porphyrostele, commonly known as the purple-stemmed liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, flattened, and often crinkled leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant's stem is prominently colored with a purplish hue, which is a defining feature of its name. Bolbidium porphyrostele thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its leaf surfaces. Its simple structure and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves are typical of bryophytes, which include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts."
