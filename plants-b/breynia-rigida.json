    "intro": "Breynia rigida, commonly known as the rigid breynia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and distinctive branching pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Breynia rigida is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
