    "intro": "Bromus delicatulus, commonly known as the slender brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Bromus delicatulus is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
