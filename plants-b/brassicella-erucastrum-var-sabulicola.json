It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, narrow leaves adapted to withstand salty air and wind. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its growth is typically low to the ground, forming dense mats that help stabilize sand dunes. The plant plays an important role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity."
