It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinct sweet aroma when crushed, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds. The plant typically grows in wet, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish bracts. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in various cultures."
