    "intro": "Breynia orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular breynia, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its ability to thrive in arid conditions makes it well-suited for xeriscaping. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its adaptability and unique morphology."
