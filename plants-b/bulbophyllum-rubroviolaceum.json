    "intro": "Bulbophyllum rubroviolaceum, commonly known as the red-violet bulbophyllum, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that display a combination of red, violet, and white hues. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The flowers bloom in clusters, often during the wet season, and are pollinated by various insects and birds."
