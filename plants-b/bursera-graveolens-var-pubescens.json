It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its aromatic, resinous bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, fragrant capsules containing aromatic resin. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry to semi-humid forests. The resin, known as copal, has been used traditionally for incense, varnishes, and medicinal purposes."
