    "intro": "Bignonia pilulifera, commonly known as the golden shower vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy appearance. Bignonia pilulifera is also valued for its ability to climb and can be used in vertical gardening or as a hedge."
