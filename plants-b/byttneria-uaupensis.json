    "intro": "Byttneria uaupensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a member of the Malvaceae family and is native to South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its latex-producing capabilities, which have historically been used in the production of natural rubber. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in clusters, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The tree thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dense rainforests."
