    "intro": "Bupleurum tatudintze, commonly known as the Tibetan angelica, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and flowering stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in umbels. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, used in traditional Tibetan medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting effects. Bupleurum tatudintze thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
