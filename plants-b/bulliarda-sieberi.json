    "intro": "Bulliarda sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's bulliarda, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
