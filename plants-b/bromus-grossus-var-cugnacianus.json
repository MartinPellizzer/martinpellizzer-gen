    "intro": "Bromus grossus var. cugnacianus, commonly known as the Cugnacian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
