    "intro": "Borzicactus websterianus, commonly known as the Webster's borzicactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stem, which is ribbed and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to its harsh, dry environment. Borzicactus websterianus is often found growing in rocky soils and is considered a rare and delicate species."
