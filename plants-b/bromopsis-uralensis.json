    "intro": "Bromopsis uralensis, commonly known as the Ural hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Bromopsis uralensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
