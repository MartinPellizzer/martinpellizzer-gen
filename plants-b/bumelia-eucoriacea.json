    "intro": "Bumelia eucoriacea, commonly known as the red buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge. Bumelia eucoriacea is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in moist woodlands."
