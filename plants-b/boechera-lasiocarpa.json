    "intro": "Boechera lasiocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arid regions. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The leaves are characterized by their rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often harsh environment."
