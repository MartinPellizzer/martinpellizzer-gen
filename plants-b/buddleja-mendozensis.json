    "intro": "Buddleja mendozensis, commonly known as the Mendozensis buddleia, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or alpine meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, adding to its ornamental appeal. Buddleja mendozensis is valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as butterflies and hummingbirds."
