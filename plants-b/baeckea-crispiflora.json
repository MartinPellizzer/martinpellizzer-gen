    "intro": "Baeckea crispiflora, commonly known as the silverleaf baeckea, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Baeckea crispiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
