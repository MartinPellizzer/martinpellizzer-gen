    "intro": "Blechnum capense f. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to southern Africa. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving the plant a distinctive appearance."
