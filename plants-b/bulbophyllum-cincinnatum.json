The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it has a delicate, epiphytic growth habit. The species is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
