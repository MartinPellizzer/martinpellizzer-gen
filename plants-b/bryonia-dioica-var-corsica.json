    "intro": "Bryonia dioica var. corsica, commonly known as Corsican bryony, is a variant of the bryony vine native to the Mediterranean region. It is a climbing plant with distinctive tendrils and thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to arid environments. The leaves are heart-shaped and lobed, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that contain toxic seeds. This plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and has historical uses in traditional medicine, though it is generally avoided due to its poisonous properties."
