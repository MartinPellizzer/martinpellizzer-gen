    "intro": "Begonia wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's begonia, is a striking tropical plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that range in color from deep green to bronze. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
