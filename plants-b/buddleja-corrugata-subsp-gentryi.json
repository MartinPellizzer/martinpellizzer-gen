    "intro": "Buddleja corrugata subsp. gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's rough buddleja, is a shrub native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its foliage is typically gray-green, and it produces elongated, cylindrical flower clusters that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
