    "intro": "Baccharis nivalis, commonly known as snow baccharis, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles snow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid landscapes."
