The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for pollinators and other wildlife."
