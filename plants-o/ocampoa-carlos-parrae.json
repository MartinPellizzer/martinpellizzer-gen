    "intro": "Ocampoa carlos-parrae, commonly known as the Carlos Parra's ocampoa, is a flowering plant species native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually yellow to orange in color, and it produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ocampoa carlos-parrae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
