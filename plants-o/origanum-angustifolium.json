    "intro": "Origanum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like carvacrol and thymol, contribute to its strong aromatic properties. Origanum angustifolium is often used in culinary applications and traditional medicine for its antimicrobial and antioxidant benefits."
