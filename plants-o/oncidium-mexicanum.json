    "intro": "Oncidium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a tropical plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant typically features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium mexicanum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
