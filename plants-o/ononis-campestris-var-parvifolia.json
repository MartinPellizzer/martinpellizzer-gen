    "intro": "Ononis campestris var. parvifolia, commonly known as small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize poor soils."
