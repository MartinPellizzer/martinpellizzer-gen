It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety foliage and showy flowers. The plant typically has rosettes of broad, waxy leaves that are often green, purple, or variegated in color. Its flowers come in a wide range of colors, including pink, purple, white, and blue, and are borne on short stems.
