    "intro": "Odontoglossum odoratum var. leeanum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid with a pseudobulb that supports its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouse environments due to its specific climate requirements."
