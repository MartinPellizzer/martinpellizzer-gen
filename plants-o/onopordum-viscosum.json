    "intro": "Onopordum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky hawk's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive seed head with bracts that resemble a hawk's beak, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Onopordum viscosum is known for its sticky resinous secretions, which can be used in traditional medicine."
