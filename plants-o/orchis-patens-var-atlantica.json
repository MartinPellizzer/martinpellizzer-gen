    "intro": "Orchis patens var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in unstable coastal environments. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to maritime climates."
