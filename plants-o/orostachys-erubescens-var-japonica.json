    "intro": "Orostachys erubescens var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese rose of Sharon, is a succulent plant native to East Asia. It features fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
