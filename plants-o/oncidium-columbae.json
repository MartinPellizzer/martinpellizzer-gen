    "intro": "Oncidium columbae, commonly known as the mourning dove orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of epiphytic species. Oncidium columbae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
