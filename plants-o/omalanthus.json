It consists of several species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with small, often clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink or purple. Omalanthus species are adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value and have traditional uses in some cultures."
