    "intro": "Oxytropis hirta, commonly known as hairy locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis hirta is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, which enhances soil fertility. However, it is also considered a noxious weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and allelopathic properties."
