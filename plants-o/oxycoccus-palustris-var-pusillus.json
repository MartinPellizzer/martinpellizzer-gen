It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces tiny, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, similar to other cranberry species. It thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and heathlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
