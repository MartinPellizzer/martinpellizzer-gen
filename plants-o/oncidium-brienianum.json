    "intro": "Oncidium brienianum, commonly known as the Brienian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Oncidium brienianum requires well-draining potting media and consistent humidity to thrive."
