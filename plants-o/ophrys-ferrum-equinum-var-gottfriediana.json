    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. gottfriediana, commonly known as the Gottfried's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a male bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract female bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to its pollinator. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
