It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly acidic taste, which contributes to its common name. Odina acida is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
