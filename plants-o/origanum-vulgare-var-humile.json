    "intro": "Origanum vulgare var. humile, commonly known as dwarf oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, aromatic leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Its leaves are widely used in cooking for their pungent, spicy flavor, and it is also valued in traditional medicine for its antimicrobial properties. The variety 'humile' is distinguished by its smaller size compared to other oregano species, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces."
