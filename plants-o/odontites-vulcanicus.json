    "intro": "Odontites vulcanicus, commonly known as the volcanic tooth plant, is a rare and unique species native to high-altitude volcanic regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like structures on its leaves, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are often white or pale blue, adding a striking contrast to its rugged foliage. Its growth is closely tied to nutrient-rich volcanic soils, which provide essential minerals for its survival. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Odontites vulcanicus is considered a sensitive indicator of volcanic ecosystem health."
