    "intro": "Oreogrammitis peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Rock Fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the rocky habitats of the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on limestone or granite outcrops. The plant has delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
