    "intro": "Ophrys crabronifera subsp. biscutella, commonly known as the Biscutella bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a wasp, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female wasp. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
