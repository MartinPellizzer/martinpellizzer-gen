    "intro": "Ophrys sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenisi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its unique pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are typically yellow or brown in color, with a distinctive three-lobed structure. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys sintenisii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
