    "intro": "Oberonia gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan Oberonia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its dark green, strap-like leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its blooming period occurs during the spring and early summer, adding to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia gongshanensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
