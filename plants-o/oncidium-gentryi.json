    "intro": "Oncidium gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that typically come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for humid environments. Oncidium gentryi is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
