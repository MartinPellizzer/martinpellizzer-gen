It is characterized by its deep red or maroon flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns of darker hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil.
