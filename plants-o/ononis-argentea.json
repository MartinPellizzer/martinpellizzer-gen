    "intro": "Ononis argentea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Silverweed is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
