    "intro": "Oreophilus tridactylus, commonly known as the three-toed mountain fern, is a unique species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. The plant's name refers to the three distinct lobes on its leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, typical of its fern family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
