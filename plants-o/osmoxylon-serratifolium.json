    "intro": "Osmoxylon serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated-leaf osmoxylon, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
