    "intro": "Orchis longicruris, commonly known as the long-legged orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has long, slender leaves that form a rosette. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its elegant appearance and ecological significance in its native habitats."
