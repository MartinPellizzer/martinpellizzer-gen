    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. huegelii, commonly known as the royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive central stem and fertile spore-bearing structures at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively and establish new growth. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value in wetland gardens."
