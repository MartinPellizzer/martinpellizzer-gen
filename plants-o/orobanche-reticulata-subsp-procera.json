    "intro": "Orobanche reticulata subsp. procera, commonly known as the tall common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plants."
