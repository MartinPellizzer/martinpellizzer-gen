    "intro": "Ochna integerrima, commonly known as the African star apple or red star tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it has a shallow root system that makes it suitable for cultivation in well-drained soils. Ochna integerrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
