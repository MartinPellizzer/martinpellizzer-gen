It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often crinkled or wavy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
