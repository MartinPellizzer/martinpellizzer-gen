It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities and ornamental appeal."
