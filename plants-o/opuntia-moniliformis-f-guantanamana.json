    "intro": "Opuntia moniliformis f. guantanamana, commonly known as the Guant\u00e1namo prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Cuba. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its thick, fleshy pads store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is valued for both ornamental purposes and traditional uses in local communities."
