    "intro": "Oswalda, commonly known as the Oswalda plant, is a rare flowering species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It features striking, bi-colored petals that range from deep crimson to soft lavender. The plant has a woody stem with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Oswalda blooms during the rainy season, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
