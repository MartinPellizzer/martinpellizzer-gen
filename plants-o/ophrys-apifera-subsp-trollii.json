It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant is characterized by its striking floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically yellow with dark markings, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Ophrys apifera subsp. trollii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
