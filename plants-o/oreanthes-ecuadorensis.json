    "intro": "Oreanthes ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian oreanthes, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a fleshy, bulb-like structure that serves as a storage organ. Oreanthes ecuadorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
