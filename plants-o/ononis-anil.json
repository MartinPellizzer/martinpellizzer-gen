    "intro": "Ononis anil, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Ononis anil is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in open habitats such as coastal dunes and grasslands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
