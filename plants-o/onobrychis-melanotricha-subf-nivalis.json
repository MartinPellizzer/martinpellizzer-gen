    "intro": "Onobrychis melanotricha subf. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine needle clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subshrub is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
