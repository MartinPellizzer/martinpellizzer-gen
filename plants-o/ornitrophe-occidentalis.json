    "intro": "Ornitrophe occidentalis, commonly known as the Western songbird plant, is a unique flowering species native to the arid regions of the western United States. It features striking, bird-like flowers that range in color from deep purples to bright yellows, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery fuzz. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sunlight to flourish. Ornitrophe occidentalis is notable for its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments due to its deep root system and drought-resistant foliage."
