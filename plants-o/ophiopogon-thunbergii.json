    "intro": "Ophiopogon thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover."
