    "intro": "[WRONG START] Orobos montanus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and showy, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Orobos montanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
