    "intro": "Oxalis discolor, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis discolor is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
