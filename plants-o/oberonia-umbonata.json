    "intro": "Oberonia umbonata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like structure formed by the fusion of the sepals and petals, which encloses the labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a color palette ranging from white to pale pink. Oberonia umbonata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
