    "intro": "Oncidium suttonii, commonly known as the Sutton's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendulous, showy flower spikes that can reach up to 3 feet in length, with individual flowers that are typically yellow to orange in color. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium suttonii is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
