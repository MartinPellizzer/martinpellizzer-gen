    "intro": "Ophioglossum hitkishorei, commonly known as the Kishore's adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, characterized by its unique, primitive morphology and spore-producing structures. The plant features a short, erect rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped sterile leaf and a separate, smaller fertile leaf that bears spores on its underside. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
