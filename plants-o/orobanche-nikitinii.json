    "intro": "Orobanche nikitinii, commonly known as the Nikitin's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or brownish coloration. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
