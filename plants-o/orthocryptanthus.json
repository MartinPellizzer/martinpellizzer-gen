    "intro": "Orthocryptanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique floral structure, with flowers that are often hidden within the foliage, giving them their common name. Orthocryptanthus species are typically found in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink in color. The genus includes several species, such as Orthocryptanthus alpestris and Orthocryptanthus glabellus, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
