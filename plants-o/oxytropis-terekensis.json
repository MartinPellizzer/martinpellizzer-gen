It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Oxytropis terekensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
