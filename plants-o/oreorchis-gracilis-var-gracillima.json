It is a perennial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, narrow lanceolate leaf. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in the study of orchid morphology and pollination ecology."
