    "intro": "Ochna angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ochna, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its simple, elongated leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive, berry-like fruits. Ochna angustifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in such conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
