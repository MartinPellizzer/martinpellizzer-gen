    "intro": "Oncidium saxicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky substrates. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange. Oncidium saxicola is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments makes it a resilient and interesting subject for botanical study."
