    "intro": "Oncostemum mandrakense, commonly known as the Mandrake Plant, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other notable species like tomatoes and peppers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet flowers. Its fruit, which resembles a small, twisted root, is the most notable feature and has been historically associated with folklore and medicinal use. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
