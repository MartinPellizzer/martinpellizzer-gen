    "intro": "Ornithopus perpusillus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate tufted sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of riparian ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
