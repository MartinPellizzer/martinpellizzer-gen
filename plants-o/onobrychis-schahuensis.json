    "intro": "Onobrychis schahuensis, commonly known as Schahuen's clover, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to harsh climatic conditions."
