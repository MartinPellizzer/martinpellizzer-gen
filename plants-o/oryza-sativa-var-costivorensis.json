    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. costivorensis, commonly known as the costive rice, is a rare and less-studied variant of rice. It is characterized by its unique grain structure and high starch content, which contribute to its distinct culinary properties. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and requires specific soil and climatic conditions for optimal growth. Its botanical features include long, slender leaves and a robust root system adapted for waterlogged soils. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
