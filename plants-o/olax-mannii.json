    "intro": "Olax mannii, commonly known as the African olive or red bushwillow, is a medium-sized evergreen shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Olax mannii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
