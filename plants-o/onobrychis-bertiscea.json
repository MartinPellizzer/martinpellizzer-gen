    "intro": "Onobrychis bertiscea, commonly known as the Balkan burr medic, is a perennial legume native to Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Onobrychis bertiscea is valued for its role in soil fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
