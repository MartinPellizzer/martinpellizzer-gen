    "intro": "Oncidium fleckiorum, commonly known as the Fleck orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting patterns. Oncidium fleckiorum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
