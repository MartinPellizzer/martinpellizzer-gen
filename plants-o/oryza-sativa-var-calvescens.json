    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. calvescens, commonly known as the wild rice of Southeast Asia, is a grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains that are typically smaller than those of domesticated rice. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, often growing in shallow water. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural applications."
