    "intro": "Odina velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are followed by triangular, winged seeds. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in diverse conditions make it a significant weed in agricultural settings."
