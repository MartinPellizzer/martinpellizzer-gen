    "intro": "Orbignya agrestis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing up to 20 seeds, which are the edible nuts harvested for their high nutritional value. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, playing a vital role in the ecosystem as a food source for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological and economic importance, conservation efforts are crucial to protect this valuable species."
