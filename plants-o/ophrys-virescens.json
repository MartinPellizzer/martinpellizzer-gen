    "intro": "Ophrys virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique greenish-yellow flowers that closely resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a slightly hairy texture. The flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of floral mimicry."
