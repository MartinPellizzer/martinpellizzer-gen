It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is native to parts of Europe, including the British Isles, and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
