    "intro": "Oncoba monacantha, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, plump fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor tidal soils. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Oncoba monacantha plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
