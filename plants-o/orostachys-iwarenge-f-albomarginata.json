    "intro": "Orostachys iwarenge f. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of East Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves often have a distinctive white or pale margin, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
