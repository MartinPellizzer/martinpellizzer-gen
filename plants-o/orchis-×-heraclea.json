    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 heraclea, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural cross between Orchis mascula and Orchis morio. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, spurred orchid flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Orchis \u00d7 heraclea is native to Europe and thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its hybrid nature makes it a fascinating example of plant speciation and genetic diversity in the Orchidaceae family."
