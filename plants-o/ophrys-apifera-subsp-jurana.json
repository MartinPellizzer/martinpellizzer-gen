    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. jurana, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a central \"face\" with a fuzzy, yellowish beard resembling a bee's face. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated through a specialized mimicry of female bees, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. This orchid is known for its ephemeral blooms, which appear for only a few weeks in the spring."
