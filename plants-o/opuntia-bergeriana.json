    "intro": "Opuntia bergeriana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, globose flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. Opuntia bergeriana is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
