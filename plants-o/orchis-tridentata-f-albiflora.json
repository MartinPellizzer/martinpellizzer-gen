    "intro": "Orchis tridentata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking white flowers. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its roots. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and feature three petals, with the lip being prominently white. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows."
