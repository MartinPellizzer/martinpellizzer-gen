    "intro": "Orchis deuterodelamainii, commonly known as the Delamain's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and distinctive, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate floral structure, which includes a specialized lip used in pollination. Its habitat is often limited to moist, calcareous soils in woodlands or meadows, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity, conservation efforts are crucial to ensure its survival in the wild."
