    "intro": "Ooclinium pedunculare, commonly known as the coral tree or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its showy, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found near the shoreline. Ooclinium pedunculare is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray."
