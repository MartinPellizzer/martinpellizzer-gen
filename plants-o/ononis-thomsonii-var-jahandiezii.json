    "intro": "Ononis thomsonii var. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Thomson's ononise, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from the nominate form."
