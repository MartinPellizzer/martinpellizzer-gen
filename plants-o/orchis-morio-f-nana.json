    "intro": "Orchis morio f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf early orchid, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of around 15-30 cm, featuring a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. It blooms from late spring to early summer, often in shaded woodland habitats. This subspecies is notable for its smaller size compared to the typical form of Orchis morio."
