    "intro": "Oreoherzogia alpina var. subrotunda, commonly known as the alpine oreoherzogia, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic compounds. The plant is typically found in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, sunny environments. Its leaves are broad and slightly lobed, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in alpine gardens."
