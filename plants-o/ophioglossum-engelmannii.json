    "intro": "Ophioglossum engelmannii, commonly known as the Englemann's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically positioned at the base of the plant. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, lanceolate leaf that is usually dark green and leathery in texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, often in rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
