It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Olearia fulvida is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
