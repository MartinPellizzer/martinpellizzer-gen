    "intro": "Orchis majalis, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Orchis majalis is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other orchid species."
