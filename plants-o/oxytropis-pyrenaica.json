    "intro": "Oxytropis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
