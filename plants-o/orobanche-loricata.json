    "intro": "Orobanche loricata, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on species of Astragalus and other legumes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
