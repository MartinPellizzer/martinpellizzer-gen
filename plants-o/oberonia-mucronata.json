    "intro": "Oberonia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Oberonia mucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
