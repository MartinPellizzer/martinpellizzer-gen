    "intro": "Orobanche crenata var. lactiflora, commonly known as the milkflower or white broom, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and the Mediterranean region, where it often grows in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its parasitic nature means it attaches to the roots of other plants, such as legumes, using specialized structures called haustoria. Despite its ecological impact, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its delicate appearance."
