    "intro": "Orchis plantaginea, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi, which helps it obtain nutrients from the soil. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind."
