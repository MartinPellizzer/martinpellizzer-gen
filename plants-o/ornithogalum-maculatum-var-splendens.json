    "intro": "Ornithogalum maculatum var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, star-shaped white flowers with a distinctive purple or reddish tinge at the base, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its nocturnal fragrance, which attracts nocturnal pollinators."
