    "intro": "Oenothera specicola subsp. hesperia, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to desert conditions, with deep roots and a low, sprawling growth habit."
