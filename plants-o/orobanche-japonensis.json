    "intro": "Orobanche japonensis, commonly known as the Japanese broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a slender, fleshy stem supporting its flowers. The plant produces small, often pale or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is typically found in open, disturbed habitats. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including some agricultural crops, making it a potential weed in certain regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions and can impact the growth of its host species."
