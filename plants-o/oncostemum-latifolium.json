It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies.
