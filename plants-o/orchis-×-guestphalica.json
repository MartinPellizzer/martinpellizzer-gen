    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 guestphalica, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between Orchis mascula and Orchis morio. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces tall spikes of showy, violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The hybrid nature of Orchis \u00d7 guestphalica contributes to its genetic diversity and adaptability in different habitats."
