    "intro": "Ononis scariosa, commonly known as sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Sand verbena is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
