    "intro": "Oxalis copiosa, commonly known as the evergreen wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped with a distinctive white or yellow spot. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in spring and summer. Oxalis copiosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via runners, forming dense ground cover."
