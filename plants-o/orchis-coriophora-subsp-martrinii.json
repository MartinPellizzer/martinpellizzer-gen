    "intro": "Orchis coriophora subsp. martrinii, commonly known as the Mart\u00edn's small helleborine, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it is classified as a protected species in several countries due to its limited distribution and conservation status. The subspecies is distinguished by subtle morphological differences from the nominate form, including variations in flower structure and leaf shape."
