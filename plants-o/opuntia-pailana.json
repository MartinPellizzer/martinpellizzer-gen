    "intro": "Opuntia pailana, commonly known as the Pailana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia pailana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
