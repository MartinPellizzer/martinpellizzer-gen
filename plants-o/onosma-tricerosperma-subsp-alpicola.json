    "intro": "Onosma tricerosperma subsp. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers in early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a short, stout stem that supports its flowering inflorescence. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
