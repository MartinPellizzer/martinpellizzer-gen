    "intro": "Olearia ramulosa, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like white flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Olearia ramulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
