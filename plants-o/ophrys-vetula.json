    "intro": "Ophrys vetula, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-brown pods that contain the seeds. Ophrys vetula is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
