    "intro": "Oxalis articulata, commonly known as the segmented wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a short, woody stem that branches near the base, giving it its common name. Its leaves are often deeply lobed and can be mistaken for those of other oxalis species. Oxalis articulata is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
