    "intro": "Oenothera nobska, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oenothera nobska is also known for its ability to produce a sticky, resinous substance that can be used in traditional medicine."
