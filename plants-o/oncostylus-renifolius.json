    "intro": "Oncostylus renifolius, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. Oncostylus renifolius typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a unique and relatively rare species within the Orchidaceae family."
