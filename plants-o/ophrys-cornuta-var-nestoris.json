    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. nestoris, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a male bee, aiding in its specialized pollination by bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
