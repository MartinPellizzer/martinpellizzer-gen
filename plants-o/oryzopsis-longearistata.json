    "intro": "Oryzopsis longearistata, commonly known as the longawn grass, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. Its flowering structure consists of spikelets that bear small, two-ranked florets. Oryzopsis longearistata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
