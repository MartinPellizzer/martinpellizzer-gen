    "intro": "Oxytropis xinglongshanica, commonly known as the Xinglongshan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern China. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
