    "intro": "Oncidium helgae, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to orange flowers during the winter months. The plant has a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oncidium helgae is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
