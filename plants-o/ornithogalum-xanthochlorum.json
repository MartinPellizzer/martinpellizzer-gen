    "intro": "Ornithogalum xanthochlorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, yellow flowers with a pale green center during the spring and early summer. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
