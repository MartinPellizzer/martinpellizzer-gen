    "intro": "Oxytropis spicata, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, sparsely arranged leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range from pink to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed sites. Oxytropis spicata is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
