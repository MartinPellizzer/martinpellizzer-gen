    "intro": "Ophiopogon longifolius f. albostriatus, commonly known as the white-striped mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that have distinctive white or pale green stripes along their length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, and as a ground cover."
