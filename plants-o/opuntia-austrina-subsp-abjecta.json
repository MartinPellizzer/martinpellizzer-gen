    "intro": "Opuntia austrina subsp. abjecta, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a cactus species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
