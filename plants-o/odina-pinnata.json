It is characterized by its distinctive pinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Odina pinnata thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
