    "intro": "Oxytropis nigrescens var. bryophila, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky, dry habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its small size and dense growth habit make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Oxytropis nigrescens var. bryophila is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
