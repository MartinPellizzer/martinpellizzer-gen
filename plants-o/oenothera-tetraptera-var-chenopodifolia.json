    "intro": "Oenothera tetraptera var. chenopodifolia, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is part of the evening primrose family and is known for its ecological importance in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
