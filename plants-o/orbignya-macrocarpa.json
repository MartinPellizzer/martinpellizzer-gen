    "intro": "Orbignya macrocarpa, commonly known as the babassu palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Amazon Basin of South America. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish flowers that develop into hard, spiny fruits. The fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a thick, oily husk. The plant is well adapted to wet, tropical environments and is often found in swampy or seasonally flooded areas. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat and is also valued for its oil-rich seeds."
