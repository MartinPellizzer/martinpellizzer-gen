    "intro": "Opuntia lagopus var. aurea, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, with a distinctive golden hue to its pads. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently in arid environments. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its edible fruits."
