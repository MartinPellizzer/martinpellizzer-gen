    "intro": "Ouratea crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens and as a houseplant."
