    "intro": "Olea dioica var. wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's olive, is a variant of the olive tree native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows in coastal and sandy soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture and a silvery underside, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are followed by small, fleshy fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to coastal environments."
