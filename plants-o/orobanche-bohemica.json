It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or purple in color. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
