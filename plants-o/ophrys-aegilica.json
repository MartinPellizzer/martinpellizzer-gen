    "intro": "Ophrys aegilica, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's petal-like structure. Ophrys aegilica thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
