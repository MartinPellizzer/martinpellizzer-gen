    "intro": "Oxalis geranioides, commonly known as the false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the true shamrock, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, often accompanied by five sepals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis geranioides is known for its ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
