    "intro": "Opuntia ficus-indica var. decumana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are modified leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, called a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. This variety is well-suited to arid environments and is often cultivated for ornamental and agricultural purposes."
