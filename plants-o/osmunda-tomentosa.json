    "intro": "Osmunda tomentosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fuzzy, silver-green fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its tall, upright fronds. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which develop in the late spring and summer. Osmunda tomentosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands."
