    "intro": "Othonna coronopifolia, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a South African endemic plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Othonna coronopifolia is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
