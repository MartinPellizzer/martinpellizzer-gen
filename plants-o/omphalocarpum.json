    "intro": "Omphalocarpum, commonly known as the \"apple of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. They are characterized by their compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The fruit is a distinctive, round, indehiscent pod that contains a single, hard-seeded nut, which is often referred to as the \"apple\" due to its shape. Omphalocarpum species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and are sometimes used in traditional medicine or as a source of fodder."
