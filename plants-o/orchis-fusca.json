    "intro": "Orchis fusca, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with tall, slender stems that bear a single spike of flowers. The flowers are usually purple or violet, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that is often darker in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to the moist, nutrient-rich soils of its habitat. The plant is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its wetland environment."
