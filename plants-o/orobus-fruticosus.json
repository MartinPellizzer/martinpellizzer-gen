    "intro": "Orobus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when unripe and turn red when mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Orobus fruticosus is adapted to Mediterranean climates and has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine."
