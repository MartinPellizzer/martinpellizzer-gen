    "intro": "Ornithopus micranthus, commonly known as slender bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a mat-forming growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Ornithopus micranthus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildlife habitats due to its nectar-rich flowers."
