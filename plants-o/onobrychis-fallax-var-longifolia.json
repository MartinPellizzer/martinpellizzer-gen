    "intro": "Onobrychis fallax var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a creeping habit with hairy stems and is adapted to dry, rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and tolerance to poor soil conditions. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long, slender leaves."
