    "intro": "Oncidium villosum, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and are known for their subtle, sweet fragrance. Oncidium villosum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
