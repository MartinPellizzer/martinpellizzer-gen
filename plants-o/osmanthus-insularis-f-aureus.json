    "intro": "Osmanthus insularis f. aureus, commonly known as the golden osmanthus, is a unique variant of the osmanthus plant native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers, which contrast beautifully with its dark green foliage. This plant is evergreen, featuring small, fragrant blossoms that appear in late autumn to early winter. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and the aromatic, nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators. The f. aureus form is particularly prized for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant."
