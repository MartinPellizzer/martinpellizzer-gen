    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. philippi, commonly known as the Philippi's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellowish-brown coloration and a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
