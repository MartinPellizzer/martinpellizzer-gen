    "intro": "Oenanthe peucedanifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the greater hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hollow and can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and can be toxic if ingested, though it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
