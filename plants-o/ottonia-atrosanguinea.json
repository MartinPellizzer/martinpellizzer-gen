    "intro": "Ottonia atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, floral structures that contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understorey of dense forests. Its flowers are short-lived but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottonia atrosanguinea is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
