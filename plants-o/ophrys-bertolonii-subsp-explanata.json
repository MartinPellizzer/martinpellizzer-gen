    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. explanata, commonly known as the Broad-leaf Bee Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces showy, bee-like flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is a member of the Ophrys genus, known for its specialized mimicry and ecological importance in pollinator interactions."
