    "intro": "Oryza monandra var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ricegrass, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, adapting to moist soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its potential ecological roles and genetic diversity within the Oryza genus."
