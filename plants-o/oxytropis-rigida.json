    "intro": "Oxytropis rigida, commonly known as rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis rigida is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
