    "intro": "Ottelia alismoides, commonly known as water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, with its leaves floating on the surface or submerged. The plant has whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, with three petals and three sepals, and they are usually white or pale pink. Ottelia alismoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water bodies."
