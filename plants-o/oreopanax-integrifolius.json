    "intro": "Oreopanax integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is evergreen, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique leaf structure."
