It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its bark is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.
