It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate with dry summers and wet winters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
