It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the family. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other umbelliferous plants. Orthaea pendula is often found in moist, grassy areas and can thrive in partial shade."
