    "intro": "Ophrys gottfriediana subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, orchid-like appearance with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
