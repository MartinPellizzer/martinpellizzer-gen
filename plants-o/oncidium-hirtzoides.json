    "intro": "Oncidium hirtzoides, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a slender, often branched stem with numerous fleshy, oblong pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow, orange, and red, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or red patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium hirtzoides is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
