    "intro": "Onosma limitanea var. major, commonly known as the Greater Persian Shield, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its striking, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
