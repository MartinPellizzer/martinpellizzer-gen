    "intro": "Oncidium stelligerum var. ernestii, commonly known as the Ernest's Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, arranged in racemes. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to attach to trees and absorb moisture from the air. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
