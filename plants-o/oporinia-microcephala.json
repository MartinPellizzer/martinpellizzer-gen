    "intro": "Oporinia microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, slender stem and small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
