    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. angustiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, often yellow or reddish, floral structures. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a short, thick stem with dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
