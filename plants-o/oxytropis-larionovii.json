    "intro": "Oxytropis larionovii, commonly known as the larionov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis larionovii is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
