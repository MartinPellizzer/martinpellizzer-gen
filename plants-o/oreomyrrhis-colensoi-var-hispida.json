    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis colensoi var. hispida, commonly known as the Colenso's oreomyrrhis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for continued protection and study."
