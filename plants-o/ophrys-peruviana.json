    "intro": "Ophrys peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers. Ophrys peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
