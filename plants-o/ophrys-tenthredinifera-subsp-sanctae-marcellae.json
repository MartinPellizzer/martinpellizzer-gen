    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. sanctae-marcellae, commonly known as the Saint Marcel's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
