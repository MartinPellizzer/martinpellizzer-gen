    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 engadinensis, commonly known as the Engadine orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Alps. It is a result of natural crossbreeding between Orchis morio and Orchis pallida, leading to a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, often in open woodland or meadows. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinctive spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. The Engadine orchid is a rare and protected species, reflecting the ecological significance of hybrid plants in botanical diversity."
