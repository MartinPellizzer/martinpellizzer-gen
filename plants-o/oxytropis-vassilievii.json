It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds."
