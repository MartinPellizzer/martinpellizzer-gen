    "intro": "Oncidium gundlachii, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a spike with a fragrant scent. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, often growing in a fan shape. Oncidium gundlachii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
