    "intro": "Ornithidium luteorubrum, commonly known as the yellow-red fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pterygopariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a distinct, lobed thallus that ranges in color from yellowish to reddish-brown. It reproduces through the production of spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporocarps. Ornithidium luteorubrum is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and moisture levels in its habitat."
