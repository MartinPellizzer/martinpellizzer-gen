    "intro": "Oglifa lagopus, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in cold, arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in a thick layer of wax to reduce water loss. Oglifa lagopus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional use in herbal medicine."
