    "intro": "Oxygyne confusa, commonly known as the confused water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, which can help in stabilizing the substrate. Oxygyne confusa is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
