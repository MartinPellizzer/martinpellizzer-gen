    "intro": "Ophrys elatior, commonly known as the Greater Butterfly Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flowers that feature a prominent, hairy lip resembling a female insect. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees, which are attracted by the flower's mimicry of a female bee. Ophrys elatior is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
