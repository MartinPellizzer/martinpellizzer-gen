It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, often adorned with small, leaf-like structures called phyllaries. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display."
