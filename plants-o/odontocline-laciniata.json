    "intro": "Odontocline laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf fern, is a tropical plant characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rainforests. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Odontocline laciniata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and air-purifying qualities."
