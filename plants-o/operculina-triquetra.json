    "intro": "Operculina triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that enclose spiral-shaped seeds. Operculina triquetra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular garden plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
