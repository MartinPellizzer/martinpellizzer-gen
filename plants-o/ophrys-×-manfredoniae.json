    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 manfredoniae, commonly known as the Manfredonia orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys lutea. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-mimicking flowers, which feature a yellowish-green lip that resembles a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in Mediterranean regions, such as southern Italy and parts of Greece. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
