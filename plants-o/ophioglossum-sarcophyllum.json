    "intro": "Ophioglossum sarcophyllum, commonly known as the sarcophyllum adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a broad, fleshy rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are clustered in small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum sarcophyllum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
