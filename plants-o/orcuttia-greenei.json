It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun. Orcuttia greenei is adapted to the arid climate and is often found in coastal scrub and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
