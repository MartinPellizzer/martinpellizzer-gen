    "intro": "Orthochilus parvilabris, commonly known as the small-lipped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers with a distinctively shaped lip. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, this species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant typically produces a single stem with a few leaves and blooms during the spring or early summer. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
