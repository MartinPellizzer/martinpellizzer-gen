    "intro": "Ophryosporus carchiensis, commonly known as the Carchi spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and diverse floral structures. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, often surrounded by colorful bracts that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophryosporus carchiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
