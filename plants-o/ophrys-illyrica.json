The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in deception. Ophrys illyrica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its evolutionary adaptation in pollination strategies."
