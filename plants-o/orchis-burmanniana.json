    "intro": "Orchis burmanniana, commonly known as Burmann's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The orchid's unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitats."
