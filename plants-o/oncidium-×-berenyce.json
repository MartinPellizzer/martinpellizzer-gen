    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 berenyce, commonly known as the Berenyce orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent species, Oncidium \u00d7 surinamense and Oncidium \u00d7 harrisonianum. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that support its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces long, arching inflorescences with clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Oncidium \u00d7 berenyce is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
