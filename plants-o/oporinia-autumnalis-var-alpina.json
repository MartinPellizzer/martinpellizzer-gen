    "intro": "Oporinia autumnalis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine autumn orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
