    "intro": "Onobrychis altissima, commonly known as the tall sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis altissima is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used historically in agriculture and as a forage crop."
