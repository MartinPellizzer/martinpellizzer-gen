    "intro": "Opuntia geissei, commonly known as the Karoo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in summer, followed by bright red or orange fruits. Opuntia geissei is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various animals."
