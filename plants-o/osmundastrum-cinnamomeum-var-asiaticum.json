It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fertile fronds are topped with clusters of spore-producing structures called sori. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
