    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with long, slender bracts that distinguish this form from the typical variety. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its morphological variation and ecological adaptations."
