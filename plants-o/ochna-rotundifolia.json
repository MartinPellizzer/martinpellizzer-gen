    "intro": "Ochna rotundifolia, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Ochna rotundifolia is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures."
