    "intro": "Opuntia elata var. oblongata, commonly known as the broad-leaved prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are broad and often lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
