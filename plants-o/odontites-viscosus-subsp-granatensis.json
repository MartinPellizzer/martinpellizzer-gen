    "intro": "Odontites viscosus subsp. granatensis, commonly known as the sticky bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its sticky secretions on the leaves are a distinctive feature, possibly serving as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these specialized ecosystems."
