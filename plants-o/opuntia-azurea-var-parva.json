    "intro": "Opuntia azurea var. parva, commonly known as the small blue prickly pear, is a compact cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, rounded stems covered in spines and glochids, with a distinctive bluish-green coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, edible fruits. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy pads. Its botanical structure makes it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and minimal water requirements."
