    "intro": "Oberonia micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers with short, narrow petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
