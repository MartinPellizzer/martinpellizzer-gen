    "intro": "Ostericum scaberulum var. scaberulum, commonly known as the rough ostericum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
