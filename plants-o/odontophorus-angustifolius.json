It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. Native to tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
