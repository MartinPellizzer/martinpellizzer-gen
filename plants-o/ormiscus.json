    "intro": "Ormiscus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their woody stems and small, clustered flowers. Ormiscus species often have thick, succulent leaves that help them conserve water in dry environments. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
