    "intro": "Oenostachys dichroa, commonly known as the twin-colored grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored leaves, which typically feature a dark green upper surface and a lighter green or silver underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Oenostachys dichroa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique leaf morphology makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
