    "intro": "Ochna arborea, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dark green, glossy leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright orange or red berries. Ochna arborea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal flowers. It prefers well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
