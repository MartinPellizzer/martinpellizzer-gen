    "intro": "Ophrys candica var. cytherea, commonly known as the Cytherean Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow face with intricate patterns resembling a bee's body. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as limestone grasslands and coastal cliffs. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
