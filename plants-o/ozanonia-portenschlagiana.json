    "intro": "Ozanonia portenschlagiana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense clusters of foliage and blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
