    "intro": "Oxalis dissecta, commonly known as the dissected wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis dissecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home garden setting."
