    "intro": "Oberonia reversidens, commonly known as the reverse-stem orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a distinctive reverse orientation of the sepals and petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
