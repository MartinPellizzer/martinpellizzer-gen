    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 dinovellae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, lanceolate leaves. The flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy."
