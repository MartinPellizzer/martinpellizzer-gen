    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of bright yellow to golden spines. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, mild flavor. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and performing photosynthesis through its flat, green pads."
