    "intro": "Orthaea apophysata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. The flowers are usually white or pale green, and the plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
