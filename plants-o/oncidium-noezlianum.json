It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium noezlianum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
