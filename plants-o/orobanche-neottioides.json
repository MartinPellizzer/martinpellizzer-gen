It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern and eastern Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
