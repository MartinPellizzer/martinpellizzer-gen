    "intro": "Ophrys eleonorae, commonly known as the Eleanor's bee orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant features a single, showy flower with a complex lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
