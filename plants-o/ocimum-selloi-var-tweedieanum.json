It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in spikes, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often grown for its aromatic leaves used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its botanical features make it distinct from other basil species, particularly in its habitat and chemical composition."
