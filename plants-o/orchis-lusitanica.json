    "intro": "Orchis lusitanica, commonly known as the Iberian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. Orchis lusitanica plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
