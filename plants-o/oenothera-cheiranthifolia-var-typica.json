    "intro": "Oenothera cheiranthifolia var. typica, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant has slender, branching stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are active at night. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds."
