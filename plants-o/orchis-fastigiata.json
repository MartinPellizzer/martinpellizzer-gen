    "intro": "Orchis fastigiata, commonly known as the upright orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, with three petals and a distinctive lip. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Orchis fastigiata thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
