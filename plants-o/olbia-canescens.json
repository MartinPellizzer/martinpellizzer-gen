    "intro": "Olbia canescens, commonly known as the gray beard grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. It is characterized by its coarse, grayish-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it useful in erosion control. Olbia canescens is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, showcasing its resilience in harsh climates."
