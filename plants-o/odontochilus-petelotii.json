    "intro": "Odontochilus petelotii, commonly known as the petelot's toothed orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, tooth-like structures on the petals, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and good drainage for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
