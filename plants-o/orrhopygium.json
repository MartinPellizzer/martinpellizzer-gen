    "intro": "Orrhopygium, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the high altitudes of South America, particularly in regions of the Andes. The plants are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. Orrhopygium species typically grow in rocky or mountainous habitats, where they thrive in cool, moist conditions. Due to their unique appearance and habitat, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
