    "intro": "Ophrys lesbis f. atargatis, commonly known as the Lesbia Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers exhibit a complex coloration and pattern, often resembling the wings of flies or bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
