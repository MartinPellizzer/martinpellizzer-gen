    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. tetraloniae, commonly known as the four-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, hairy sepals and petals that form a bee-like shape, enhancing its mimicry. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
