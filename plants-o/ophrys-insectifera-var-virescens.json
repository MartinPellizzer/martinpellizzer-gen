    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers that mimic the appearance of a wasp, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting male wasps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the wasp mimicking flower deceives the insect into attempting to mate with it, thereby facilitating pollination."
