    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh hound orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in environments with high humidity. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
