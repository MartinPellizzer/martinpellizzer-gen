It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features a short, woody trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and leathery in texture. Opophytum theurkauffii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions."
