    "intro": "Otophora tricocca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Otophora tricocca is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
