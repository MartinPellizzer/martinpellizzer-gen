    "intro": "Osbeckia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow or yellow willow, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and streambanks. The plant features slender, often reddish stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a sticky resin. Its showy yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Osbeckia glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
