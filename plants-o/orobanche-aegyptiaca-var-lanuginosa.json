    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the legume family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil until a suitable host is present. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
