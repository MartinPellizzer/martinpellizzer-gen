    "intro": "Orchis integrata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, leafless stem that bears two opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are pollinated by insects. Orchis integrata typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other orchid species."
