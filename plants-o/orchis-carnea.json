    "intro": "Orchis carnea, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are tuberous, aiding in nutrient storage. Orchis carnea is notable for its role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
