    "intro": "Ornithidium flavoviridium, commonly known as the yellow-green liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that is typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure called a thallus that absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. It thrives in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Ornithidium flavoviridium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms."
