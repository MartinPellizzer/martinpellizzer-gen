    "intro": "Onopordum \u00d7 macronervosum, commonly known as the giant thistle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy purple or pink flower heads. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region but has been introduced to other parts of the world. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in some regions, making it both a notable ornamental and a potential weed."
