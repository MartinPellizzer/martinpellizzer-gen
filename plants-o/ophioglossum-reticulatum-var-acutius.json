    "intro": "Ophioglossum reticulatum var. acutius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense network of veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
