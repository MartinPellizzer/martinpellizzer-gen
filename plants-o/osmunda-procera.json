    "intro": "Osmunda procera, commonly known as the royal fern, is a tall, perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Osmunda procera plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
