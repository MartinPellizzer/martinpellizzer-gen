    "intro": "Ononis umbellata, commonly known as the common whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting insect populations. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in grassy areas."
