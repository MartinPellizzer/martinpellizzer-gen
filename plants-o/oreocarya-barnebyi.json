    "intro": "Oreocarya barnebyi, commonly known as the Barneby's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of western Mexico. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and growth habits. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in cloud forest environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocarya barnebyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
