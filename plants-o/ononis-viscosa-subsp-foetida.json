    "intro": "Ononis viscosa subsp. foetida, commonly known as stinkcup, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its strong, unpleasant odor, particularly in the flowers, is a notable botanical feature."
