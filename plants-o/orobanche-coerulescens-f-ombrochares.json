    "intro": "Orobanche coerulescens f. ombrochares, commonly known as the rain-loving broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. This subspecies is characterized by its pale green to yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale pink. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant growth and diversity."
