    "intro": "Orobanche lucorum f. rubi, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of legumes. This semi-parasitic species is characterized by its reddish stems and small, showy flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
