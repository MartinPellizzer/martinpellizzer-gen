    "intro": "Oberonia smisrae, commonly known as the Mindanao orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clustered, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
