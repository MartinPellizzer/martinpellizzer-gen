    "intro": "Ophiopogon bodinieri var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf Japanese spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with a mat-forming habit, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded areas. The plant produces small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, preferring cool, humid conditions. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth and attractive foliage throughout the growing season."
