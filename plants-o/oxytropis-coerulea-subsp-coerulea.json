    "intro": "Oxytropis coerulea subsp. coerulea, commonly known as blue milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
