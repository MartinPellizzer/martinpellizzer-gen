    "intro": "Odontochilus moulmeinensis, commonly known as the Moulmein toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive tooth-like appearance on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a contrast to its delicate floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
