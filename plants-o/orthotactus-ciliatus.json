    "intro": "Orthotactus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy orthotactus, is a small, delicate annual plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Orthotactus ciliatus is often overlooked due to its modest size and unassuming blooms, but it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
