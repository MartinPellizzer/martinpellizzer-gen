    "intro": "Oxandra sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower oxandra, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that are typically sessile, meaning they lack stalks. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Oxandra sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral characteristics."
