    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. microcarpa, commonly known as dwarf rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its small grain size and compact plant structure. It is native to Southeast Asia and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, with short, sturdy stalks and narrow leaves. Its grains are smaller than those of typical rice varieties, which makes it suitable for specific culinary and agricultural uses. This variety is also valued for its resilience to certain environmental stresses, making it an important crop in regions with limited resources."
