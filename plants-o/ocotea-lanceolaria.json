It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by oval-shaped berries. Ocotea lanceolaria is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its aromatic wood and ecological role in its native habitats."
