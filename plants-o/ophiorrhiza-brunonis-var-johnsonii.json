    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza brunonis var. johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in brackish water environments, such as estuaries and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and is adapted to saltwater conditions through specialized root systems. It produces small, white flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by small, round fruits. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
