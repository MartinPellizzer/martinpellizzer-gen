    "intro": "Oreogrammitis crenulata, commonly known as the serrated wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often serrated along the edges. This plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid climates. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis crenulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
