    "intro": "Ononis serrata, commonly known as sawtooth cupplant, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Ononis serrata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
