    "intro": "Ochthocharis buruensis, commonly known as the Buru orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Buru in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but striking, often displaying a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ochthocharis buruensis is considered a critically endangered species."
