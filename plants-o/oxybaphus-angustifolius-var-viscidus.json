    "intro": "Oxybaphus angustifolius var. viscidus, commonly known as the sticky narrow-leafed oxybaphus, is a member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, sticky resin. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits. This variant is notable for its unique resinous coating, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
