    "intro": "Oxytropis alii, commonly known as the Indian pea or wild alfalfa, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, such as parts of India and the Middle East. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to pale purple pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Oxytropis alii is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and benefits surrounding vegetation."
