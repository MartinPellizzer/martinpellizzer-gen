It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Oxytropis lalehzarensis is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ecological role includes providing forage for grazing animals, though it can be toxic in high quantities."
