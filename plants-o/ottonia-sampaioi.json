    "intro": "Ottonia sampaioi, commonly known as the Sampaio's ottonia, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant has a short, compact stature with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, Ottonia sampaioi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
