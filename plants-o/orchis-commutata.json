    "intro": "Orchis commutata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Orchis commutata is notable for its lack of showy petals, with its reproductive structures being more subtle and adapted for specific pollination mechanisms."
