    "intro": "Orobanche crithmi-maritimi, commonly known as the sea holothurian or sea bladder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe, where it typically grows on the roots of sea holly (Crithmum maritimum). The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in sandy or rocky shore habitats. Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems, though it is not commonly cultivated or widely recognized in horticulture."
