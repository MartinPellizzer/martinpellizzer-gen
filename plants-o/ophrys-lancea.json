    "intro": "Ophrys lancea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces slender, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a unique lip that resembles a bee's face. Ophrys lancea thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in calcareous soils."
