    "intro": "Ornithophora radicans f. alba, commonly known as the white-veined climbing plant, is a variant of the ornithophora species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive white veins on its heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises. The f. alba form is notable for its lighter coloration compared to other forms of Ornithophora radicans."
