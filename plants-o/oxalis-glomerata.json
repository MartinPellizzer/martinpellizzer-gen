It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow, spurred flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and stems that often root at the nodes. Oxalis glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
