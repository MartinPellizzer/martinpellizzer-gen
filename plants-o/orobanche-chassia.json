    "intro": "Orobanche chassia, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can cause significant damage to crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
