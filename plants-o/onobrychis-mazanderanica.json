It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Mazanderan clover is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
