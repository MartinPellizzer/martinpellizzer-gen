    "intro": "Octomeria edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmund's octomeria, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescence that displays bright orange or red flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species, making it a subject of interest for botanical conservation efforts."
