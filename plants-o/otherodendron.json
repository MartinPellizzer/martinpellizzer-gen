    "intro": "Otherodendron, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, often pale or white flowers that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with woody stems and simple, alternate leaves. Otherodendron species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral display."
