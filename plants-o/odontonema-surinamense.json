    "intro": "Odontonema surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam bellflower, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar production."
