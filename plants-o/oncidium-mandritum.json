    "intro": "Oncidium mandritum, commonly known as the Mandritum orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendant, showy flower spikes that often display a mix of yellow, green, and brown hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. The orchid requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive."
