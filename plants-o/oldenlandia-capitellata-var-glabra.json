    "intro": "Oldenlandia capitellata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth oldenlandia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
