    "intro": "Ochlopoa harveyi, commonly known as Harvey's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Ochlopoa harveyi is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
