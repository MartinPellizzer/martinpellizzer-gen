    "intro": "Odontostemma ionandrum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils. The plant produces delicate, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
