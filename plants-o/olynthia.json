    "intro": "Olynthia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the spring. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and animals, are dark blue when mature. Olynthia is often found in rocky or dry soils and is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
