    "intro": "Opuntia monacanthos var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunah, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. The spines, or glochids, are fine and can cause irritation, making careful handling necessary."
