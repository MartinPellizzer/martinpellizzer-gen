    "intro": "Oryzopsis leiopoda, commonly known as the smooth-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Oryzopsis leiopoda plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
