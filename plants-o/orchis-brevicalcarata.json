    "intro": "Orchis brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single spike of flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive hood-like structure covering the reproductive organs. This orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial plant that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful seed germination."
