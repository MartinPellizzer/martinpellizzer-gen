    "intro": "Oncidium crispum, commonly known as the wrinkled orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive crinkled appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Oncidium crispum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
