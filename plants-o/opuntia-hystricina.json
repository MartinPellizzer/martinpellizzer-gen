    "intro": "Opuntia hystricina, commonly known as the long-nosed hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny glochids, which are fine, barbed hairs that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a strong, sour taste. Opuntia hystricina is a drought-tolerant plant adapted to arid environments, making it a common sight in deserts and rocky landscapes. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
