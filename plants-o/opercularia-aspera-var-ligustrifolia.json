    "intro": "Opercularia aspera var. ligustrifolia, commonly known as the Ligustrum-leaved Opercularia, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish-gray in color. The lobes of the thallus are irregular and often have a serrated or toothed margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on bark or soil in forested areas. This variant is distinguished by its resemblance to the leaves of the Ligustrum genus, giving it its common name."
