    "intro": "Oligochaeta moschata, commonly known as the musk snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Helicidae and is characterized by its spiral shell and moist, soft body. The plant refers to the snail's habitat, which typically includes moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Oligochaeta moschata plays a role in nutrient cycling by feeding on decaying plant matter. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
