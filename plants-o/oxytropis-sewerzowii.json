    "intro": "Oxytropis sewerzowii, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oxytropis sewerzowii is also known for its toxic alkaloids, which can affect livestock that graze on it."
