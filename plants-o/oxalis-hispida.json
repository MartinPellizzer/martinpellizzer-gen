    "intro": "Oxalis hispida, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though the oxalic acid content should be considered. Oxalis hispida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
