    "intro": "Onychacanthus arboreus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, orchid-like appearance. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining natural environment, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
