    "intro": "Oncidium macropus, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from yellow to orange, often with a striking red or purple lip. The plant has a pseudobulb structure and is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically arranged in racemes and bloom during the dry season. Oncidium macropus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
