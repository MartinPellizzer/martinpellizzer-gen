    "intro": "Olearia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky olearia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine, sticky resin, which gives it its common name and helps protect it from herbivores. Olearia glutinosa is often found in coastal and inland areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
