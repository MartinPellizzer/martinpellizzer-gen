    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca subsp. lucentina, commonly known as the Lucentina bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking contrast of dark purple and yellow hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
