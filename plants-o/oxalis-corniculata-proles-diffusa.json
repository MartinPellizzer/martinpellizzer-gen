    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata proles diffusa, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a flowering plant characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. It is a member of the Oxalidaceae family and is native to Asia, particularly regions of China and Japan. The plant has a trailing growth habit, often forming dense mats, and produces tiny, bead-like fruits that disperse seeds efficiently. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, making it important to handle with care."
