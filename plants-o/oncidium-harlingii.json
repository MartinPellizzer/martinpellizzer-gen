    "intro": "Oncidium harlingii, commonly known as the Harling's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flower spikes that bear numerous small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium harlingii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
