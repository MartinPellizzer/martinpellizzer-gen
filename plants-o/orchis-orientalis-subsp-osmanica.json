    "intro": "Orchis orientalis subsp. osmanica, commonly known as the Osman orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Turkey. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, hairy stem that bears a single, showy violet or purple flower. The plant has a complex life cycle, often requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and growth. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming for only a few days during late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in its natural range."
