    "intro": "Orobanche lobelii, commonly known as the Lobel's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of species like Astragalus and Crotalaria. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its flowers are often arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in certain regions."
