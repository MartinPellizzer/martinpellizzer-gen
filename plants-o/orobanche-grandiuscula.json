It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
