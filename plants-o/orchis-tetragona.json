It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and meadow habitats. The plant features a stout, square-stemmed stem that bears several whorled, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in a raceme, with each flower having a distinctive, hooded labellum and spurred petals. Orchis tetragona is known for its pale purple to white flowers and is often associated with ancient woodlands and grasslands."
