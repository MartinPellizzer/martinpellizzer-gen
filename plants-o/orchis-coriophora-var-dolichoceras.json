    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. dolichoceras, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short root system adapted to its specific ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
