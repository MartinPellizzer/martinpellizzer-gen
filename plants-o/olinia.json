    "intro": "Olinia, commonly known as the African starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The tree produces small, star-shaped fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous. Olinia is valued not only for its fruit but also for its potential use in traditional medicine."
