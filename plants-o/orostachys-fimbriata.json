    "intro": "Orostachys fimbriata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of East Asia. It features dense, fimbriated (fringed) leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
