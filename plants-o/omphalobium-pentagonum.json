It is characterized by its distinctive pentagonal seed pods and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Omphalobium pentagonum is also valued for its use in pasture rehabilitation and as a forage crop."
