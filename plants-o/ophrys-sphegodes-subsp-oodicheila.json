    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. oodicheila, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
