    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites var. platycheila, commonly known as the flat-leaf bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and flat, contributing to its common name, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
