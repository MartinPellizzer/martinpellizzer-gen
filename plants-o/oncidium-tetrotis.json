    "intro": "Oncidium tetrotis, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium tetrotis requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
