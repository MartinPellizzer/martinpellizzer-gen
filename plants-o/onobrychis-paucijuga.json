    "intro": "Onobrychis paucijuga, commonly known as the lesser burr clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its root system is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is used in some regions for forage or soil stabilization. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
