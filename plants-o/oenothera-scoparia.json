    "intro": "Oenothera scoparia, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its tissues. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss through transpiration. Oenothera scoparia is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
