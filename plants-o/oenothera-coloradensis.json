    "intro": "Oenothera coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oenothera coloradensis is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, making it a common sight in prairies and along roadsides."
