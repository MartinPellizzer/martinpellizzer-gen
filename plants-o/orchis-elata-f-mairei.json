    "intro": "Orchis elata f. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's tall orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a single, elongated spike bearing several violet or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
