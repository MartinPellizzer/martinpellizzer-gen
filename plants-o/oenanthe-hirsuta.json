    "intro": "Oenanthe hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy water-dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant features a slender, branched stem with hairy leaves that are alternate and pinnately divided. Its small, white flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in early summer. Oenanthe hirsuta is often found in wetland habitats and is characterized by its aromatic, sometimes slightly toxic, foliage."
