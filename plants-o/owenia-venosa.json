    "intro": "Owenia venosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It is native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction make it an invasive species in many areas. Owenia venosa is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and agricultural fields, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
