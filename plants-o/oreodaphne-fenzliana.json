    "intro": "Oreodaphne fenzliana, commonly known as the Fenzli's oreodaphne, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or green, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
