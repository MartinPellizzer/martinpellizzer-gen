    "intro": "Ophrys antiochiana, commonly known as the Antioch orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in parts of Greece and Turkey. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower has a distinctive lip that resembles a female face, a feature common in many orchid species used for pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and blooms in late spring or early summer. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
