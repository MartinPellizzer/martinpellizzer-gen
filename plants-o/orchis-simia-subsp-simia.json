    "intro": "Orchis simia subsp. simia, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and North Africa. This species is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling the fur of a monkey, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments with rich, humusy soil. Its life cycle includes a period of dormancy, with the plant relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during early growth stages. The orchid's unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms make it an intriguing subject in botanical studies."
