    "intro": "Opuntia pygmaea, commonly known as the miniature prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, flattened stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which are unique to the Cactaceae family. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pygmaea is a succulent plant, adapted to arid environments with its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
