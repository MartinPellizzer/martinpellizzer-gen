    "intro": "Osmanthus ilicifolius var. subangustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved osmanthus, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard osmanthus species. The plant produces fragrant yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late autumn and are highly valued for their aromatic properties. These flowers are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening in temperate climates."
