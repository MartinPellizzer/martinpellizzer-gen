    "intro": "Oberonia alopecurus, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
