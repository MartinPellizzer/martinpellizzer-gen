    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. liburnica, commonly known as the Liburnian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a single, showy bloom per stem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
