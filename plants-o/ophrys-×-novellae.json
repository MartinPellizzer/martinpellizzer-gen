    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 novellae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange with dark markings, and the plant produces a single spike of blooms. Ophrys \u00d7 novellae is a perennial herb that exhibits a unique form of sexual deception in its pollination strategy."
