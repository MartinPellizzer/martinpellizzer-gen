    "intro": "Oplopanax horridus var. brevilobus, commonly known as the short-lobed ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves with short lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries that are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist forest environments and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a threatened species in some regions."
