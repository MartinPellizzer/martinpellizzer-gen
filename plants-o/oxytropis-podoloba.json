    "intro": "Oxytropis podoloba, commonly known as the Alaska oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain the seeds. Oxytropis podoloba plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
