    "intro": "Oenothera deltoides subsp. piperi, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soils. Its seeds are encased in a hairy capsule that dehisces to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
