    "intro": "Ottonia peltata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped at the base, with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Ottonia peltata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique foliage and adaptability to wet conditions make it a notable species in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
