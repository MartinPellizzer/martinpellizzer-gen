It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It is often found growing on limestone or among gravelly soils. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
