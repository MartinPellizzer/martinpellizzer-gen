    "intro": "Oreochloa pedemontana, commonly known as the mountain grass or Pedemontana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky and mountainous environments, often found in the Andes and other highland areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in its native habitat."
