It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Odontotrichum pallescens is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
