    "intro": "Oryzopsis holciformis var. kokanica, commonly known as the Kokanica grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
