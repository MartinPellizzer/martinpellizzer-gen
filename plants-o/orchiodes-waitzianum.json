    "intro": "Orchiodes waitzianum, commonly known as the Waitz's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, and often fragrant flowers that can be pink, purple, or white in color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The orchid's unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
