    "intro": "Ononis natrix subvar. minor, commonly known as lesser sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
