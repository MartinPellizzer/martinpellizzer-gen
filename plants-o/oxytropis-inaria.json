    "intro": "Oxytropis inaria, commonly known as the narrowleaf burroclover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale pink to violet, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis inaria is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
