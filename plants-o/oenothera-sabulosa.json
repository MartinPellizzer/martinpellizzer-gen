    "intro": "Oenothera sabulosa, commonly known as beach evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenothera sabulosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
