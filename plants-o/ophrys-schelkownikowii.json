    "intro": "Ophrys schelkownikowii, commonly known as the Schelkunov's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like face and is typically found in rocky or limestone soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with specific microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
