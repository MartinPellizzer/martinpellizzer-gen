    "intro": "Oxytropis gaudinii, commonly known as the yellow locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. However, it is toxic to livestock due to the presence of certain alkaloids."
