    "intro": "Orobanche pamiroalaica, commonly known as the Pamir mistletoe, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its specialized haustorial structures for attaching to host plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it parasitizes various species of grasses and shrubs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
