It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
