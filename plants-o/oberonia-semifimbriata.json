    "intro": "Oberonia semifimbriata, commonly known as the semi-fringed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with fringed petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often clustered at the base of the plant. Oberonia semifimbriata is a rare and endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and over-collection."
