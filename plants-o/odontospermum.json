    "intro": "Odontospermum, commonly known as the \"gum tree\" or \"gum plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Odontospermum species are typically shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and fragrant blooms. These plants are valued both for their ornamental appeal and their ecological role in their native habitats."
