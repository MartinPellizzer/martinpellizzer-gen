    "intro": "Opuntia clarkiorum, commonly known as Clark's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, providing protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia clarkiorum plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
