    "intro": "Oxalis juruensis, commonly known as the Juruense wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its foliage contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis juruensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
