    "intro": "Oxypogon, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to various regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Tanzania and Kenya. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive red or reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its density and aesthetic qualities. Oxypogon species typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction."
