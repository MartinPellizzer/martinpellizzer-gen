    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers have a distinctive shape with two prominent, horn-like projections on the labellum, which aid in pollination by mimicking the appearance of a female bee. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its intricate pollination mechanism and limited distribution."
