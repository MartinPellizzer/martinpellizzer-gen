It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in the leaf axils. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has a fibrous root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height."
