    "intro": "Oxytropis prostrata, commonly known as creeping locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces yellow or pale green flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to thrive in dry soils and is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along roadsides. Oxytropis prostrata is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of other plants around it."
