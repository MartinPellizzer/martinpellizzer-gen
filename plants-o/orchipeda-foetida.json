    "intro": "Orchipeda foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark, fleshy leaves and its striking, often fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its unique scent, which can be unpleasant to some, is believed to attract specific pollinators. Orchipeda foetida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
