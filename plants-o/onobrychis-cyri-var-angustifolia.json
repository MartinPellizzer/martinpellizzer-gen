It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers in clusters. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and dry conditions. It is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in small, spiny pods that aid in seed dispersal."
