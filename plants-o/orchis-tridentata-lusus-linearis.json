    "intro": "Orchis tridentata lusus linearis, commonly known as the slender twayblade, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
