    "intro": "Ophioglossum pendulum subsp. falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's tongue, is a member of the Ophioglossaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces a spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is located at the base of the leaf. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a unique appearance that resembles a serpent's tongue. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific geographic regions with suitable humidity and soil conditions."
