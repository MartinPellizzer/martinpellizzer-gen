    "intro": "Ocymastrum calcitrapa, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Ocymastrum calcitrapa is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
