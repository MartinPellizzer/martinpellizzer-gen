    "intro": "Orchis brevicornis var. fallax, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale greenish-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
