    "intro": "Oreoselis cervaria, commonly known as the red-stemmed liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and bright green leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white powdery wax. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its stems are reddish in color, which distinguishes it from many other liverwort species. Oreoselis cervaria plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
