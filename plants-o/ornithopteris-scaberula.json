    "intro": "Ornithopteris scaberula, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing fronds that are typically shorter than the sterile fronds. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of small, rough scales, giving it a distinctive texture. Ornithopteris scaberula thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
