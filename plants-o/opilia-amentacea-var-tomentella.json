    "intro": "Opilia amentacea var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly opilia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Elaeocarpaceae family. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a leathery texture. Opilia amentacea var. tomentella is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories."
