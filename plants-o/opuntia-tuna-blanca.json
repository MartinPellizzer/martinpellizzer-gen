    "intro": "Opuntia tuna-blanca, commonly known as the white prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The pads and fruits are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
