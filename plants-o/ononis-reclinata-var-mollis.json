    "intro": "Ononis reclinata var. mollis, commonly known as silky sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly succulent texture, adapted to thrive in arid environments. It is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
