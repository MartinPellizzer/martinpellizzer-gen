    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense spike of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form colonies. The flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind."
