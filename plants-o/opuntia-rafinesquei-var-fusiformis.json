    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei var. fusiformis, commonly known as the narrow-pearled prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its ability to provide food and habitat in desert ecosystems."
