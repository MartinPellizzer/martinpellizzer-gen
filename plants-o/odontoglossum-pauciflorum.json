It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single or few leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive tooth-like spur, which is a key botanical feature. Odontoglossum pauciflorum is typically grown as a terrestrial orchid in cultivation due to its specific environmental requirements."
