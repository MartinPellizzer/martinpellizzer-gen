    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 macrospilum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent plants, Oncidium and Macrospilum. It is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful flowers that can range from yellow to orange and red, with intricate patterns. The plant typically has a sympodial growth habit, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for epiphytic growth. Oncidium \u00d7 macrospilum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
