    "intro": "Otoglyphis maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its unique, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fibrous roots that help it anchor in loose, dry ground. Otoglyphis maroccana is often found in rocky or semi-desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
