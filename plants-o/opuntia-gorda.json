    "intro": "Opuntia gorda, commonly known as the Gorda prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Opuntia gorda thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in regions with limited rainfall."
