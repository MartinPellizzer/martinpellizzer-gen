    "intro": "Orobanchia radicans, commonly known as the common broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, often white or pale flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in various habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. Its life cycle involves germinating on the roots of host plants, where it establishes a connection for nutrient uptake. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
