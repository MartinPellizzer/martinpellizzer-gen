    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 ligustica nothosubsp. reginae, commonly known as the Queen's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Orchis ligustica and Orchis \u00d7 reginae. It typically features tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers in shades of purple and white. The flowers are arranged in dense spikes and are characterized by their intricate, lip-shaped petals and prominent spur. This nothosubspecies is native to regions in southern Europe, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid form that showcases the genetic diversity within the Orchis genus."
