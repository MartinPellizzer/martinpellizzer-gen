    "intro": "Ophrys flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive dark brown marking on the lip, which plays a role in attracting pollinators. Ophrys flavescens is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where male bees attempt to mate with the flower, transferring pollen in the process."
