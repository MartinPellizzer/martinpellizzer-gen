    "intro": "Oberonia umbraticola, commonly known as the dark forest orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or branches. The plant has dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its unique habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
