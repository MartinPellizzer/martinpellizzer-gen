    "intro": "Oreomecon alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, which includes poppies and other related genera. This perennial herb typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in cold, rocky soils. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is not widely used in modern pharmacology."
