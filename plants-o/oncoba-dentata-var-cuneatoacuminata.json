    "intro": "Oncoba dentata var. cuneatoacuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sabal palm, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnate leaves that are composed of long, narrow leaflets with a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark purple or black berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in coastal areas with high humidity. The varietal name 'cuneatoacuminata' refers to the shape of its leaflets, which are narrow at the base and taper to a sharp point."
