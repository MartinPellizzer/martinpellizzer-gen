    "intro": "Ophrys kotschyi subsp. ariadnae, commonly known as the Ariadna's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
