    "intro": "Opuntia carolina, commonly known as the Carolina prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the summer, followed by edible, spherical fruits known as tunas. Opuntia carolina thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. It is a drought-tolerant plant that plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
