    "intro": "Oreosciadium acaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of an above-ground stem, with leaves directly emerging from the base. The plant produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
