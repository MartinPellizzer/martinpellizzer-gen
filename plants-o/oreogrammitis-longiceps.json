    "intro": "Oreogrammitis longiceps, commonly known as the long-headed rock fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky stream banks and forest floors. The plant has a compact, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are typically 15\u201330 cm long and bear small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. Oreogrammitis longiceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid, woodland ecosystems."
