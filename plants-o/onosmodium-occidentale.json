    "intro": "Onosmodium occidentale, commonly known as the western onosmodium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
