    "intro": "Orobanche mutila, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish to reddish coloration. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It typically infests a variety of host plants, including those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
