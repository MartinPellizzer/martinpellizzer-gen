    "intro": "Orobus albus var. rumelicus, commonly known as the white orchid of the Alps, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, preferring well-drained and sunny habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
