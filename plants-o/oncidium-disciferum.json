    "intro": "Oncidium disciferum, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Oncidium disciferum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
