    "intro": "Octolobus angustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed waterplantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Octolobus angustatus plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for various aquatic organisms."
