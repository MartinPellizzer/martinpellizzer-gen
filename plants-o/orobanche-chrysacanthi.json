    "intro": "Orobanche chrysacanthi, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces striking yellow flowers and is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant's life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, often a species of Astragalus. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize leguminous crops. Its unique biology makes it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
