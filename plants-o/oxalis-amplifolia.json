It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. Oxalis amplifolia is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
