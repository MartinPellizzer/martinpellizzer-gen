    "intro": "Opuntia lubrica, commonly known as the slippery prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which can cause irritation upon contact. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia lubrica is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its ability to store water in its pads makes it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
