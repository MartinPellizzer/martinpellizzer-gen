    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to coastal regions of Europe and is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of suitable host species and environmental conditions such as moisture and temperature. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems, influencing both plant community dynamics and soil nutrient cycles."
