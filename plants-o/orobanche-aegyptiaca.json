    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers and has a highly reduced root system. It is often found growing on the roots of legumes such as vetch and clover. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
