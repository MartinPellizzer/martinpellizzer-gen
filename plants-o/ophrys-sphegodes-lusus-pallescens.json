    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes lusus pallescens, commonly known as the pale marsh helleborine, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanism. It produces showy, lip-like petals that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and meadows, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. The pale marsh helleborine is a protected species in many regions due to its declining populations and habitat specificity."
