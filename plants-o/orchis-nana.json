    "intro": "Orchis nana, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with rich, loamy soil. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, violet or purple flowers in early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Orchis nana is a relatively rare species in many regions, making it a valuable component of diverse plant communities."
