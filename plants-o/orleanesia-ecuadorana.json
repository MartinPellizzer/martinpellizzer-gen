    "intro": "Orleanesia ecuadorana, commonly known as the Ecuadorian orleanesia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and the flowers are often white or pale pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orleanesia ecuadorana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
