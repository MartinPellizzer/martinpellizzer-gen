    "intro": "Onobrychis balansae var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited burclover, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
