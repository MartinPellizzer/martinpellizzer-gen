    "intro": "Oxalis simplicifolia, commonly known as the simpleleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant. Oxalis simplicifolia is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking easy-to-care-for plants."
