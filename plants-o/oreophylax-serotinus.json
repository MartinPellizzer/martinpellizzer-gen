    "intro": "Oreophylax serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high-elevation environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its flowering period occurs late in the growing season, usually in late summer or early autumn, hence its common name. Oreophylax serotinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various alpine wildlife species."
