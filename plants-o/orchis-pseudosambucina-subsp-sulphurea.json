    "intro": "Orchis pseudosambucina subsp. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow and green flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while the roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
