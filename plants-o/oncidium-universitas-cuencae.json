    "intro": "Oncidium universitas-cuencae, commonly known as the Cuenca orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
