    "intro": "Oncidium inferlobum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks leaves and relies on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in the understory of rainforests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
