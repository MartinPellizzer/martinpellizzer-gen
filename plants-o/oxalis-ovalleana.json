    "intro": "Oxalis ovalleana, commonly known as the kidneyleaf oxalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically bright green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in spring. Oxalis ovalleana thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long bloom period."
