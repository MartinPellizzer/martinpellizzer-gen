It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis pilosissima is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
