    "intro": "Osmia obscura, commonly known as the dark orchard mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, dark-colored bee with a robust body and hairy wings, typically ranging in length from 8 to 12 millimeters. This species is known for its preference for nesting in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or artificial bee houses. Osmia obscura primarily pollinates fruit trees and wildflowers, contributing significantly to both agricultural and ecological systems. Its role as a pollinator makes it an important species for maintaining plant biodiversity."
