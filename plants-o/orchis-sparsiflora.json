    "intro": "Orchis sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy purple or violet flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. The species is characterized by its sparse flowering pattern, which gives it its common name."
