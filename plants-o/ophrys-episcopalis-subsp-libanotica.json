    "intro": "Ophrys episcopalis subsp. libanotica, commonly known as the Libanotica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a bee-like appearance that aids in pollination by mimicking the visual cues of female bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, hairy labellum that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
