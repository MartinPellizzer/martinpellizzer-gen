It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Ortgiesia alegrensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to protect its dwindling population."
