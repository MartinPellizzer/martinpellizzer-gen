    "intro": "Orchis hostii, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it blooms from June to August. Orchis hostii plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
