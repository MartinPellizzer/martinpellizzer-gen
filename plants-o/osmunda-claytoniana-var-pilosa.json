    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The fronds are typically longer and more robust compared to the standard variety, with a fuzzy texture on the underside due to the presence of fine, hairy structures. This plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland habitats and its use in ecological restoration projects."
