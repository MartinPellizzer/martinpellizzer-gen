    "intro": "Ouratea riparia, commonly known as the Brazilian starling tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruits are small drupes that contain a single seed, and the tree can reach heights of up to 15 meters. Due to habitat loss, Ouratea riparia is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts in its native range."
