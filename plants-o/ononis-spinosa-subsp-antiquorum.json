    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. antiquorum, commonly known as ancient sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
