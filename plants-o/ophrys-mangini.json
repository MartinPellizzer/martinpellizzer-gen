    "intro": "Ophrys mangini, commonly known as the Mangini's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized pouch at the base, designed to receive pollen from visiting insects. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys mangini is considered a vulnerable species."
