    "intro": "Oncidium stacyi, commonly known as the Stacy's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers. The plant typically produces blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium stacyi is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
