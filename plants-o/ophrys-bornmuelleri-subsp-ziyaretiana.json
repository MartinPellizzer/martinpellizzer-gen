    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri subsp. ziyaretiana, commonly known as the Turkish bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that closely resembles a female bee, which is a key adaptation for its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in mountainous regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species requiring conservation efforts."
