    "intro": "Ochlandra kadambaranii, commonly known as the Kadambaranii orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which are often fragrant, bloom in clusters and display a range of hues including white, yellow, and pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ochlandra kadambaranii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
