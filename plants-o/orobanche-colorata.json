    "intro": "Orobanche colorata, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes crops like wheat and corn. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops, making it a concern for farmers."
