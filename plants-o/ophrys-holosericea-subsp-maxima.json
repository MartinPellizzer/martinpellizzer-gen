    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. maxima, commonly known as the Greater Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, yellow-and-black patterned lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique arrangement of sepals and petals that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered in several parts of its range."
