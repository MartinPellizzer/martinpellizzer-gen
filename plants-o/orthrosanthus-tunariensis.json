    "intro": "Orthrosanthus tunariensis, commonly known as the Tunariensis orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant grows as an epiphytic orchid, often found attached to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
