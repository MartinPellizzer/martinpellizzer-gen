It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
