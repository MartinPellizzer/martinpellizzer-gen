    "intro": "Orthospermum, commonly known as the \"blueweed\" or \"orthospermum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. They are characterized by their small, blue or purple flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and the plants tend to be herbaceous with a compact growth habit. Orthospermum species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
