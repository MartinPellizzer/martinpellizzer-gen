    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus var. setarius, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a distinctive silvery or grayish hue due to dense pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks."
