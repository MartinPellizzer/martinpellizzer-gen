    "intro": "Orobanche crenata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host plants, making it a challenging weed to manage in crops."
