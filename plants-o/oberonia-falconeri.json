    "intro": "Oberonia falconeri, commonly known as the Falconer's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinctive coloration, with a mix of white, green, and yellow hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia falconeri is considered a vulnerable species."
