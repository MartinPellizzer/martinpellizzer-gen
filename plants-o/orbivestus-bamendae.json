It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive orb-shaped inflorescence. The plant features hairy, ovate leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in the montane forests of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
