    "intro": "Oncidium pumilum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf miniature orchid, is a compact, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, clustered pseudobulbs and produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant has linear, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its delicate appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
