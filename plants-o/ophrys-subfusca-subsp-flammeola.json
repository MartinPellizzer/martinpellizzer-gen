    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca subsp. flammeola, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure called a labellum, which plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant produces striking flowers with a vivid yellow and orange coloration, often mimicking the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators. It thrives in open, calcareous soils and is typically found in grasslands and heaths. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
