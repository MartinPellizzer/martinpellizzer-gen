    "intro": "Ornithopus repandus, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Ornithopus repandus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
