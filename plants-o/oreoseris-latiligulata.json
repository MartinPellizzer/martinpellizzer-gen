    "intro": "Oreoseris latiligulata, commonly known as the yellow sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Oreoseris latiligulata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation."
