    "intro": "Orobanche coelestis, commonly known as the celestial broom or devil's lettuce, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant's life cycle begins with seeds that germinate in response to chemical signals from host roots. It attaches to the host using specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. Orobanche coelestis is often found in disturbed soils and can be a significant pest in agricultural settings."
