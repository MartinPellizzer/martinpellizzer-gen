    "intro": "Odontites serotinus subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone scorpionvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fern-like leaves and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. This subspecies thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. The plant typically grows in open environments such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, sunny conditions with low nutrient availability."
