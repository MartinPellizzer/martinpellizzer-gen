    "intro": "Otoglossum schmidt-mummii, commonly known as the Schmidt-Mumm's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and vibrant, often contrasting colors in its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its flowers are short-lived but highly ornate, featuring intricate patterns and a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Otoglossum schmidt-mummii is considered a rare and endangered species."
