    "intro": "Ophrys dimidiata, commonly known as the half-veined helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female insects, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture, and it produces greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive veining pattern. Ophrys dimidiata is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
