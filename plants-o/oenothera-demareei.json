    "intro": "Oenothera demareei, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera demareei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
