    "intro": "Oncidium fasciculatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that produce clusters of yellow or yellow-orange flowers resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and serve as storage organs for water and nutrients. Oncidium fasciculatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
