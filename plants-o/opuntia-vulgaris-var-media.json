    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris var. media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and small glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
