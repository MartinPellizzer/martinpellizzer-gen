    "intro": "Oberonia brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-stem orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark brown, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Oberonia brunnescens is a low-growing plant that thrives in shaded, humid environments with high organic matter in the soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
