    "intro": "Onopordum transiens, commonly known as the transient thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is an annual, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both a resilient weed and a potential ornamental plant."
