    "intro": "Orobanche squamaria, commonly known as the scaly broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitats."
