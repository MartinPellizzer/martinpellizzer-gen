    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils, rocky areas, and along paths, where it thrives in full sun."
