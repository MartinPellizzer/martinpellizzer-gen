It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive yellow or red fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and hairy, adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Ononis polysperma is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
