    "intro": "Orobus tuberosus var. aphillus, commonly known as the tuberous orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-gray hue due to a waxy coating. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
