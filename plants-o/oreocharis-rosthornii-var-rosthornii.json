It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often in shaded environments where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces tiny, fragrant blossoms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
