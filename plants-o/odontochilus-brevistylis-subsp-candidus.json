    "intro": "Odontochilus brevistylis subsp. candidus, commonly known as the white-styled toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive white, spurred flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure, featuring a prominent, white, tooth-like projection at the base of the lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
