    "intro": "Ophrys aymoninii, commonly known as the Aymonin's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination mechanism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys aymoninii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
