    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, hard, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
