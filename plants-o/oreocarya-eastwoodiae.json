    "intro": "Oreocarya eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's oreocarya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
