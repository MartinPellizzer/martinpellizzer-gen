    "intro": "Orobanche crenata f. alba, commonly known as white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions and is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of a host plant and establishing a haustorium to absorb water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
