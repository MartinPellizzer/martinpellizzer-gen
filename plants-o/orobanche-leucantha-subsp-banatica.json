It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is found in various regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants as hosts. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
