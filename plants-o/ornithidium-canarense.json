    "intro": "Ornithidium canarense, commonly known as the Canary Island fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often used in horticultural displays. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of most ferns. Ornithidium canarense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
