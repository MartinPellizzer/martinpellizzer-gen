    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax f. carbajoi, commonly known as the Carabajoi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant has a short, hairy stem with a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with brown markings. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing on rocky or calcareous soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
