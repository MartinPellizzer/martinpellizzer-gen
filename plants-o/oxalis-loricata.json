    "intro": "Oxalis loricata, commonly known as the shieldleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features distinctive heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, shield-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow or white, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
