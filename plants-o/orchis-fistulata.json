    "intro": "Orchis fistulata, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in areas with high water tables. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces distinctive, tubular flowers that attract various pollinators. Orchis fistulata is often found in association with other wetland flora and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
