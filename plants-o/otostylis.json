    "intro": "Otostylis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that often appear to hover above the ground, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Otostylis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
