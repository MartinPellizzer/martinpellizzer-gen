    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. superba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it has slender, lance-shaped leaves. It is characterized by its reduced leaves and the presence of a single, elongated ovary. This variety is often distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Orchis angustifolia."
