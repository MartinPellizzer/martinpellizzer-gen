    "intro": "Oncidium biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters of two to four. Its roots are typically aerial, adapting to its natural habitat on trees and rocks. Oncidium biflorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
