    "intro": "Onychium crumenatum, commonly known as the alpine onychium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Onychium crumenatum is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist climates."
