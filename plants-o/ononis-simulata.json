    "intro": "Ononis simulata, commonly known as rockweed or sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Ononis simulata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes."
