    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sanctae-cruccis, commonly known as the Holy Cross bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in regions of southern Europe, including parts of Italy and France. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with a distinctive bee-like shape and intricate patterns. The species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
