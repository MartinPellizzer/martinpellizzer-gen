    "intro": "Othonna humilis, commonly known as the dwarf othonna, is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
