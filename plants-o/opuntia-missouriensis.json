    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia missouriensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with low rainfall."
