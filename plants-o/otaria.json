    "intro": "Otaria, commonly known as the sea otter, is a semiaquatic mammal rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects. However, if you meant a plant with a similar name, there may be confusion. The name \"Otaria\" is not associated with any known plant species in botanical databases. It is possible that the name was misheard or miswritten. Please verify the correct name of the plant you are referring to."
