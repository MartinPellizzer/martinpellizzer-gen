    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia subsp. decumbens, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that lie close to the ground. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its forage qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
