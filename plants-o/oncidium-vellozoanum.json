    "intro": "Oncidium vellozoanum, commonly known as the Vellozoa orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry periods. Oncidium vellozoanum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
