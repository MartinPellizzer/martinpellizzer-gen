It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded areas within forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
