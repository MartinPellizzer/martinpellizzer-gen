    "intro": "Otophora paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure that resembles a miniature tree or shrub. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a distinctively shaped lip. Otophora paradoxa thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
