    "intro": "Orobus littoralis, commonly known as the coastal orobus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Orobus littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
