    "intro": "Orimaria filiformis, commonly known as the slender orimaria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, thread-like stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall delicate appearance. Orimaria filiformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
