    "intro": "Oreophilus lynnianus, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and exquisite flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in rocky crevices or shaded forest understories. The plant features striking silver-green foliage with a velvety texture, complemented by delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, Oreophilus lynnianus is considered an endangered species."
