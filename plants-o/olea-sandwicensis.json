    "intro": "Olea sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible fruits that are similar in appearance to olives. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mesic habitats. Due to its limited range and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species."
