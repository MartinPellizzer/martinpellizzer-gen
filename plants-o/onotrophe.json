    "intro": "Onotrophe, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which later develop into spherical, red berries. Onotrophe is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
