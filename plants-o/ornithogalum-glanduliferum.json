    "intro": "Ornithogalum glanduliferum, commonly known as the glandular star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the leaves and stems, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum glanduliferum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in gardens."
