    "intro": "Ornithogalum canaliculatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Ornithogalum canaliculatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
