    "intro": "Orthopogon burmanni var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth burmann sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces distinctive, three-angled fruiting structures. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous surface, giving it a more refined appearance compared to other varieties in the species."
