    "intro": "Ormosia monchyana, commonly known as the Guatemalan ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Ormosia monchyana is typically found in tropical dry forests and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
