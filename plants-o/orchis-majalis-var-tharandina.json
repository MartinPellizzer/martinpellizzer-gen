    "intro": "Orchis majalis var. tharandina, commonly known as the Tharandine fairy orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive flowering stem that produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-brown lip. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insects such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
