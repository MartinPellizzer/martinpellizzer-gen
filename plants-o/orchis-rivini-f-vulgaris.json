    "intro": "Orchis rivini f. vulgaris, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike. It is characterized by its reduced leaves and the presence of a single, often inconspicuous, leaf at the base. This orchid is known for its symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
