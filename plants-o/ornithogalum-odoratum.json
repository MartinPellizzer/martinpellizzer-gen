    "intro": "Ornithogalum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with a sweet, honey-like fragrance. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients and water for survival. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and unique scent, it is often cultivated in gardens for both its beauty and fragrance."
