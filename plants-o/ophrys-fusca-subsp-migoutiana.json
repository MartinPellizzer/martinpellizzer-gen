    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. migoutiana, commonly known as the dark bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually dark brown to black, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
