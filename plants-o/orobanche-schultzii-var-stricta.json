    "intro": "Orobanche schultzii var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a small, fleshy stem and a cluster of flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, yellowish or greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families, and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized plant species."
