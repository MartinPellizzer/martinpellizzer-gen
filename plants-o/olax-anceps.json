    "intro": "Olax anceps, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, brown fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. Olax anceps is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions."
