    "intro": "Oncidium chrysopyramis, commonly known as the golden torch orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces showy, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that resemble torches. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. Oncidium chrysopyramis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
