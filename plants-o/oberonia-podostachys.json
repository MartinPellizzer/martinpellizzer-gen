    "intro": "Oberonia podostachys, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, vine-like growth habit and its ability to climb or trail along the forest floor. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia podostachys is considered a vulnerable species."
