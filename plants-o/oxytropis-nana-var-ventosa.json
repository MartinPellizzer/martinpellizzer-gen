    "intro": "Oxytropis nana var. ventosa, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered foliage and pea-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small size and dense growth habit make it well-suited for stabilizing soil in disturbed areas. The species is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility in its native range."
