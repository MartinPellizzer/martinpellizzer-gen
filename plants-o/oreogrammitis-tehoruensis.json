    "intro": "Oreogrammitis tehoruensis, commonly known as the Tefaru fern, is a rare and unique species native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can receive the necessary humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreogrammitis tehoruensis is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
