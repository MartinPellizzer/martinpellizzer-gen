It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often with a slight reddish tinge. Ochyrorchis occlusa thrives in dry, sandy soils and is typically found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
