    "intro": "Oncidium longicornu var. grossmannii, commonly known as the Grossmann's Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, strap-like leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
