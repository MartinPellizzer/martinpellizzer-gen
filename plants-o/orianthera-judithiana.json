    "intro": "Orianthera judithiana, commonly known as the Judith's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues, making it a visually captivating plant. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down that helps reflect sunlight. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Orianthera judithiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
