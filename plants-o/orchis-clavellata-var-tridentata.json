    "intro": "Orchis clavellata var. tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring three prominent teeth on the labellum, which is a distinctive feature of the orchid family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
