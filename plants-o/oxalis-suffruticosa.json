    "intro": "Oxalis suffruticosa, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and ability to spread through stolons. Oxalis suffruticosa is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, lemony flavor."
