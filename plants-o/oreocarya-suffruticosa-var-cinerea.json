    "intro": "Oreocarya suffruticosa var. cinerea, commonly known as the cinerea oreocarya, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its grayish-white, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, often appearing in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ericaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
