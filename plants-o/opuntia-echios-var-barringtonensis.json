    "intro": "Opuntia echios var. barringtonensis, commonly known as the Barrington's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. This variety is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in tropical and subtropical climates."
