    "intro": "Ophiomeris espirito-santensis, commonly known as the Esp\u00edrito Santo dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the island of Esp\u00edrito Santo in Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and it produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy seed heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
