    "intro": "Orobanche vulgaris, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth of its host, making it a challenging weed to control."
