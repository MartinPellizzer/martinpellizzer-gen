    "intro": "Orchis traunsteineri subsp. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white orchis, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its morphology includes a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of flowers at the top. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
