    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza rugosa var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in saline or brackish water environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant has thick, woody stems covered in a rough, rugose texture, which helps it withstand tidal forces and saltwater exposure. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a smooth surface. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark, spherical berries that are dispersed by water and birds."
