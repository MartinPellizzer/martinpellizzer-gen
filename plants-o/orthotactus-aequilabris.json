    "intro": "Orthotactus aequilabris, commonly known as the flat-leafed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
