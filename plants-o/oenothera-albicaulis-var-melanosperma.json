    "intro": "Oenothera albicaulis var. melanosperma, commonly known as the black-seed evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its most distinctive characteristic is the dark, almost black seeds it produces, which are enclosed in a capsule-like fruit. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some historical use in traditional medicine."
