It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are yellow or orange in color. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.
