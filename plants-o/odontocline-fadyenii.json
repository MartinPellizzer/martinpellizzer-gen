    "intro": "Odontocline fadyenii, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Odontocline fadyenii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
