    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata var. lapethica, commonly known as the Lapethic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in alpine or subalpine zones, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species, with limited distribution and population size."
