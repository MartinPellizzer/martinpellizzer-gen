    "intro": "Oxalis lepida, commonly known as the shield leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive shield-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, triangular seed pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Oxalis lepida is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
