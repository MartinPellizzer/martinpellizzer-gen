    "intro": "Oryzopsis leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky grass or the silky millet, is a perennial grass species native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, leafy stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its flowering occurs in late summer, and the seeds are dispersed by wind. Oryzopsis leiocarpa is valued for its potential in forage and as a source of plant-based materials."
