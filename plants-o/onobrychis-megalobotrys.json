    "intro": "Onobrychis megalobotrys, commonly known as the giant burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
