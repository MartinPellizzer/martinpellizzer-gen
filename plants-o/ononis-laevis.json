    "intro": "Ononis laevis, commonly known as silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and gravelly soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Ononis laevis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
