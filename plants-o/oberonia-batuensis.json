    "intro": "Oberonia batuensis, commonly known as the Batu Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Oberonia batuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
