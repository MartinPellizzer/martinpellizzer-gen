It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive bur-like seed pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
