    "intro": "Ononis rigida, commonly known as rigid sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Ononis rigida is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to xerophytic habitats."
