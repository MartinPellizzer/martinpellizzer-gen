    "intro": "Ophiopogon parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat, with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Ophiopogon parviflorus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its historical use in traditional medicine."
