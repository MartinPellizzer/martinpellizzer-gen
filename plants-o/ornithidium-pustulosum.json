    "intro": "Ornithidium pustulosum, commonly known as the spiny bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered with tiny, spiny projections. Ornithidium pustulosum is known for its carnivorous habits, making it an interesting subject in the study of plant adaptations."
