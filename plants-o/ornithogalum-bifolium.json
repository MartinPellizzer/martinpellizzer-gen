    "intro": "Ornithogalum bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, fibrous rootstock and produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has two opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum bifolium is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
