    "intro": "Ostryocarpus lucidus, commonly known as the glossy shield-fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, shiny, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct, shield-like formations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, organic soil near streams or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
