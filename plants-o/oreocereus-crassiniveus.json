    "intro": "Oreocereus crassiniveus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions with well-drained soil. Its flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This unique botanical feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
