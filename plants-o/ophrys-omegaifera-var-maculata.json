    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy flower that has a distinctive yellow and brown coloration with dark spots. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
