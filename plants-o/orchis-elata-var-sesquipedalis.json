    "intro": "Orchis elata var. sesquipedalis, commonly known as the tall orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This variant is notable for its elongated flower spike and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
