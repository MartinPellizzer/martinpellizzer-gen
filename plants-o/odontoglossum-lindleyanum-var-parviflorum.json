    "intro": "Odontoglossum lindleyanum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a compact orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique spurred shape. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the previous ones. Its leaves are elliptical and grass-like, often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant due to its specific care requirements."
