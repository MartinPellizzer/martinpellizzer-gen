    "intro": "Orchis majalis f. linguata, commonly known as the linguate orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodland floors and meadows. Its orchidaceous structure includes a single, erect stem with a cluster of showy, pinkish-purple flowers. This rare form is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
