It features rhizomatous growth and produces dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive blue-gray underside. The plant blooms with small, white, bell-shaped flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
