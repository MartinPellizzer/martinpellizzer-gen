    "intro": "Ochna glauca, commonly known as the blue ochna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a slightly hairy surface, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Ochna glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
