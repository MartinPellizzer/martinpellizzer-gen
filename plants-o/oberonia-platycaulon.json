    "intro": "Oberonia platycaulon, commonly known as the flat-stemmed orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive, short, and thickened stem that stores water, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically arranged in a spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Oberonia platycaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements."
