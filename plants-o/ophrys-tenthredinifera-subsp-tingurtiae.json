    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. tingurtiae, commonly known as the Tingurtian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct bee-like shape. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique pollination strategy."
