    "intro": "Obeliscaria pinnata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and saline conditions. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Obeliscaria pinnata plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
