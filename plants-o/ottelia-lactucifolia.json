    "intro": "Ottelia lactucifolia, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are broad and succulent, often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
