    "intro": "Oberonia cryptantha, commonly known as the cryptic orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the damp, mossy substrates it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia cryptantha is considered a vulnerable species."
