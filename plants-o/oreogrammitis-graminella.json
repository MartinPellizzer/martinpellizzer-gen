    "intro": "Oreogrammitis graminella, commonly known as the grassy wall-rush, is a small, perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats on rocky or soil surfaces. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis graminella is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
