    "intro": "Oedera muirii, commonly known as the Muir's sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Oedera muirii is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands in suitable environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
