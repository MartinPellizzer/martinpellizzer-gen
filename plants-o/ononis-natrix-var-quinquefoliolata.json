    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. quinquefoliolata, commonly known as the five-leafed sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The leaves are pinnately divided, often with five to seven leaflets, giving it the \"quinquefoliolata\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
