    "intro": "Oenothera irrigua, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to conserve water. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects. Oenothera irrigua is known for its resilience in harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
