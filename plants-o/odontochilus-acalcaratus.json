    "intro": "Odontochilus acalcaratus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
