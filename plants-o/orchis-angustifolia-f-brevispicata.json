    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. brevispicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect flower spike that bears a single, pale yellow or greenish-white orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with acidic soils. Its flowers are usually short-spurred, giving it the specific epithet *brevispicata*, which refers to its brief spur. This orchid is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
