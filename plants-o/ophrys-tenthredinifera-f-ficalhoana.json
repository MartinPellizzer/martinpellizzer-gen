    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera f. ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalho's bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which is a key adaptation for pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
