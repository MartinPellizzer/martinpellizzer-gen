    "intro": "Oncidium maizifolium, commonly known as the maize leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that resemble maize leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow and green flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium maizifolium is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
