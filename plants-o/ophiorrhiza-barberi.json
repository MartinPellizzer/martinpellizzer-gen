    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza barberi, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small shrub characterized by its unique, pendulous inflorescences and small, elliptical leaves. The plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in difficult terrain with limited nutrients. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-exploitation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
