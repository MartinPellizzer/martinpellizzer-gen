    "intro": "Opuntia wilcoxii, commonly known as the Wilcox prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia wilcoxii is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species."
