    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. extensa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single spike of pale purple or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil."
