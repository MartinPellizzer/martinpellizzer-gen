    "intro": "Oliveriana brevilabia, commonly known as the narrow-lipped orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers with narrow lips. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its botanical features include slender stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oliveriana brevilabia is considered a species of conservation concern."
