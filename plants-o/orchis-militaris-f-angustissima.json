    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. angustissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved soldier's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and is often associated with specific microhabitats that support its growth. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
