    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
