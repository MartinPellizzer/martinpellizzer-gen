    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark, hairy labellum that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The variety cornuta is distinguished by its elongated, horn-shaped spur, which is a key feature in its taxonomic classification."
