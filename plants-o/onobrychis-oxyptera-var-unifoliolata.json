    "intro": "Onobrychis oxyptera var. unifoliolata, commonly known as the single-leaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, though the varietal form unifoliolata has a single leaflet, making it distinct from other varieties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in forage and soil stabilization efforts."
