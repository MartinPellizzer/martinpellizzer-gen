    "intro": "Orchis hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or open woodland habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are often arranged in a loose raceme, with each bloom featuring three sepals and three petals, one of which is modified into a lip. Orchis hookeri is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
