    "intro": "Oxalis sellowiana, commonly known as the Sellow's wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis sellowiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
