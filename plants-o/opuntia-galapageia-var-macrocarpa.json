    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant's spines are modified stems, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss."
