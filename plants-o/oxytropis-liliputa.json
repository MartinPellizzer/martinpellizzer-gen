    "intro": "Oxytropis liliputa, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds."
