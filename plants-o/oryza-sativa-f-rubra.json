    "intro": "Oryza sativa f. rubra, commonly known as red rice, is a botanical variant of the common rice species characterized by its reddish pericarp. This variety is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The red coloration of the rice grains is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are more concentrated in the outer layer of the grain. It is often used as a specialty rice in culinary applications and can also be used in traditional medicine. The plant exhibits a short growth cycle and is relatively drought-tolerant compared to other rice varieties."
