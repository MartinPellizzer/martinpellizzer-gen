    "intro": "Oxymeris ciliata, commonly known as the silky mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, strap-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along coastal areas. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water. Oxymeris ciliata plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
