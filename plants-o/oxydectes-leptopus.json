    "intro": "Oxydectes leptopus, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. The plant has slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae. Oxydectes leptopus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native ecosystems."
