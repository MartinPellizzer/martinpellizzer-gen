    "intro": "Oncidium adamsii, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has long, strap-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan shape. Oncidium adamsii is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
