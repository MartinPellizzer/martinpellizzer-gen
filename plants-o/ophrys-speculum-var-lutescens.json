    "intro": "Ophrys speculum var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow mirror orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Europe. This variant is distinguished by its vivid yellow petals and a unique, bee-like appearance that aids in pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are characterized by intricate patterns and a specialized structure that facilitates pseudocopulation with male bees. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
