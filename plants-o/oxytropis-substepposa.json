    "intro": "Oxytropis substepposa, commonly known as the steppe milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, often growing in well-drained soils. Oxytropis substepposa is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
