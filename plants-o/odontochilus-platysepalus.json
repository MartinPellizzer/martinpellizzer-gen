    "intro": "Odontochilus platysepalus, commonly known as the flat-sepal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and distinctive, flat, elongated sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
