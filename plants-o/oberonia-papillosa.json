    "intro": "Oberonia papillosa, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions."
