    "intro": "Oncidium harrisoniae, commonly known as the Harrison's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of its epiphytic nature. Oncidium harrisoniae requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
