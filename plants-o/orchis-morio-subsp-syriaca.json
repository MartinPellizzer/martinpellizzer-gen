    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded shape, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are often rich in nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and narrower leaves compared to the typical O. morio."
