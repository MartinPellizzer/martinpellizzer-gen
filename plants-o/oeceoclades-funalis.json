    "intro": "Oeceoclades funalis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots to absorb nutrients from the air and rain. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in the canopy of tropical forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Oeceoclades funalis is considered a critically endangered species."
