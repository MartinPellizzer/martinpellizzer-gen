    "intro": "Ozomelis anomala, commonly known as the red-stemmed milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to reddish in color, which attract various pollinators. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, containing latex that can cause skin irritation. Ozomelis anomala thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
