    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. crispa, commonly known as the curly water fern, is a variant of the royal fern that is distinguished by its finely curled fronds. This fern is native to wetlands and riparian zones in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive zigzag or curling pattern along their edges. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
