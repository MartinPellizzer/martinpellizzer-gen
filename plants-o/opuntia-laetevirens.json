    "intro": "Opuntia laetevirens, commonly known as the bright green prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are typically green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Opuntia laetevirens is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily through its flat, photosynthetic pads. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine."
