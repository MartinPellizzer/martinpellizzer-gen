    "intro": "Obsitila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant has a single, slender stem with a few leaves and produces flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its rarity and ecological specificity make it a subject of both scientific interest and conservation concern. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, obsitila is listed as endangered in several states."
