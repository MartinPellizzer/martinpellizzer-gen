    "intro": "Oenanthe karsthia, commonly known as the Karst's oenanthe, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the cooler months of the year. Oenanthe karsthia is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
