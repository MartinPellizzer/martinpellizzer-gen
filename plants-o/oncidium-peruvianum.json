    "intro": "Oncidium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear multiple fragrant, yellowish-green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette, allowing for efficient water collection. Oncidium peruvianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
