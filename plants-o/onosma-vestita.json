It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss.
