    "intro": "Ornithopus laevigatus, commonly known as smooth sowthistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are smooth and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and oval, often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Ornithopus laevigatus is often found in fields, roadsides, and other disturbed habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
