    "intro": "Ophelia paniculata var. brachypetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features finely divided, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its stems are submerged. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters during the spring and early summer. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, broader leaves compared to other Ophelia species."
