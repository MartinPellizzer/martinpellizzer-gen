    "intro": "Onopordum dyris, commonly known as the Narrowleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring a robust taproot and upright stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces pale yellow flowers in composite heads, which are surrounded by spiny, bracts that serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are narrow, often with a silvery-white underside, and are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. Onopordum dyris is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides."
