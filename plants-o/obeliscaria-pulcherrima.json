    "intro": "Obeliscaria pulcherrima, commonly known as the Christmas star or star of Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, green berries that mature to a dark purple color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom even in colder climates, adding a touch of winter color to gardens."
