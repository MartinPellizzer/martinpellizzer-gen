It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
