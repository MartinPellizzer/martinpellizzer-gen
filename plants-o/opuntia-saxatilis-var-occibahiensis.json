    "intro": "Opuntia saxatilis var. occibahiensis, commonly known as the Baja flat cactus, is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to the Baja California Peninsula. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
