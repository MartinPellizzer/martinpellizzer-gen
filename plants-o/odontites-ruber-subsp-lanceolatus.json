    "intro": "Odontites ruber subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the red rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
