It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its fragrant, spurred orchid blooms. Orchis condensa is often found in association with other orchid species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological and floral significance."
