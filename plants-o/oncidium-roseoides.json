    "intro": "Oncidium roseoides, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Oncidium roseoides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
