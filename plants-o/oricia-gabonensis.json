    "intro": "Oricia gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oricia gabonensis is considered a vulnerable species."
