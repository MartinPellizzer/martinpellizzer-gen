    "intro": "Olearia cydoniifolia, commonly known as the pineapple tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces clusters of yellow flowers that resemble pineapples, hence its common name. The plant has a fibrous, woody stem and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Olearia cydoniifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
