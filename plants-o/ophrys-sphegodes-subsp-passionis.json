    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. passionis, commonly known as the Passion Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait known as pseudocopulation, used to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces a single, striking flower with a dark, wasp-like labellum and a distinctive, reddish-brown coloration. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
