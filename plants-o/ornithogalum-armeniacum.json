    "intro": "Ornithogalum armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is part of the Asparagaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, making them a potential irritant. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
