    "intro": "Orobanche variegata var. nepae, commonly known as the spotted broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that often go unnoticed. It is found in Mediterranean regions and parts of Europe, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
