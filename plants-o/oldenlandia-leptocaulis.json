    "intro": "Oldenlandia leptocaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its nocturnal blooming habit and fragrant flowers make it a unique addition to botanical gardens."
