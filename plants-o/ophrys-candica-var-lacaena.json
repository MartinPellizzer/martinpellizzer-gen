    "intro": "Ophrys candica var. lacaena, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect bodies. This orchid is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, often with a lip that is highly specialized for attracting pollinators."
