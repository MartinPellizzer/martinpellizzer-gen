It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often divided into several narrow segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Onobroma multifidum is typically found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
