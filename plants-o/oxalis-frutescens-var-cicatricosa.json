    "intro": "Oxalis frutescens var. cicatricosa, commonly known as the scarlet wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red or purple underside, and small, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often used in culinary applications, though it should be consumed in moderation due to its oxalic acid content. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
