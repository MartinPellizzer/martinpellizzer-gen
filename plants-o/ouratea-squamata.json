It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height, featuring dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its fruits are spherical, woody capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
