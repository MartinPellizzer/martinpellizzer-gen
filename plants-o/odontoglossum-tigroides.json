    "intro": "Odontoglossum tigroides, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tiger-striped leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Odontoglossum tigroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
