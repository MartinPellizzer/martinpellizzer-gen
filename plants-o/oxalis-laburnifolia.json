    "intro": "Oxalis laburnifolia, commonly known as the golden oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of clover, with a distinctive yellowish-green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense, attractive ground covers."
