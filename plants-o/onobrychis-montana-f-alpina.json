    "intro": "Onobrychis montana f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine burclover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces bur-like seed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and is considered a valuable plant for ecological restoration in high-altitude environments."
