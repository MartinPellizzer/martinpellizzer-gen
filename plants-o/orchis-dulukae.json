    "intro": "Orchis dulukae, commonly known as the Druzhba orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem and a cluster of pale pink to purple flowers. The plant has a short underground rhizome and produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store nutrients. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchis dulukae is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
