    "intro": "Olea capensis var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-textured olive, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by oval, fleshy fruits that contain a single stone. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
