    "intro": "Orobanche variegata var. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
