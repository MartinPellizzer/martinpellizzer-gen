    "intro": "Oreobolopsis, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their small, fleshy leaves and showy, often white or pink flowers. Oreobolopsis species are generally low-growing and have a compact, cushion-like form. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with specialized structures to conserve water."
