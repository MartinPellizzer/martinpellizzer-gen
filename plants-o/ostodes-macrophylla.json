    "intro": "Ostodes macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Australia. It is characterized by its large, strap-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or wetlands. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
