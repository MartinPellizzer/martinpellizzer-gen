    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandalwood, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments. Ophiorrhiza tenuis is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of incense."
