    "intro": "Ophelia teres, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its small, white flowers bloom in early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Ophelia teres is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
