    "intro": "Ophrys unifolia, commonly known as the single-flowered bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of about 20\u201340 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys unifolia thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky habitats."
