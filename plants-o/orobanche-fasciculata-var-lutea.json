    "intro": "Orobanche fasciculata var. lutea, commonly known as the yellow dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a root-parasite, attaching itself to the roots of various host species, primarily those in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, and it is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth and health of its host plants, making it both ecologically significant and potentially problematic in agricultural settings."
