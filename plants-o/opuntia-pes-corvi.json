    "intro": "Opuntia pes-corvi, commonly known as the crow's foot prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Opuntia pes-corvi is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
