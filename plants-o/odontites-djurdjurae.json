    "intro": "Odontites djurdjurae, commonly known as the Djurdjura toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disk florets and white ray florets, typically blooming in the spring. Odontites djurdjurae is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it an important species for ecological studies in its native region."
