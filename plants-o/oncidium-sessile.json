    "intro": "Oncidium sessile, commonly known as the bare-stem orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of long, strap-like leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Oncidium sessile is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, warm environments. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their longevity and aesthetic appeal."
