It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including hairy stems and roots, which help it thrive in coastal and saline environments. The plant typically grows in mangrove forests and is adapted to withstand brackish water conditions. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ophiorrhiza eriantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
