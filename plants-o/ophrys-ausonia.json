    "intro": "Ophrys ausonia, commonly known as the Apennine bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flowering stem. Ophrys ausonia is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across Italy and parts of the Balkans."
