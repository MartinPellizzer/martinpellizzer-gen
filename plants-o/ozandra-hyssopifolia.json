    "intro": "Ozandra hyssopifolia, commonly known as the rock hyssop, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ozandra hyssopifolia is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
