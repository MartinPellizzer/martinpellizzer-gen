These plants are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves that are often glabrous or nearly so. The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, usually with five sepals and numerous stamens. Ohlendorffia species are often found in moist habitats such as riverbanks and wet meadows. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shady conditions."
