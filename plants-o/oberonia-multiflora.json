    "intro": "Oberonia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a dense, compact growth habit and is characterized by its numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white blooms, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the flowering stem. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Oberonia multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
