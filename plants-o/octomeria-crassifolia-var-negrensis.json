    "intro": "Octomeria crassifolia var. negrensis, commonly known as the Negrense thickleaf octomeria, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically oval or elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink, which bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
