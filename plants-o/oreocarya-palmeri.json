    "intro": "Oreocarya palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is often found in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Oreocarya palmeri is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of its ecosystem."
