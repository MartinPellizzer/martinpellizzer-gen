    "intro": "Oplismenus minor, commonly known as the small bladdernut, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, inflated fruits that resemble small bladders, hence its common name. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has simple, alternate leaves with smooth margins. Oplismenus minor is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
