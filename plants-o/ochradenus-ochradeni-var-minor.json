    "intro": "Ochradenus ochradeni var. minor, commonly known as the small desert holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small white or pale yellow flowers, typically in spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing shelter for small desert animals."
