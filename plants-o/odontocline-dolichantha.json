    "intro": "Odontocline dolichantha, commonly known as the slender-leafed milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to certain regions of Africa. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract various pollinators. Its milky sap, characteristic of the milkweed family, can be toxic if ingested. Odontocline dolichantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats."
