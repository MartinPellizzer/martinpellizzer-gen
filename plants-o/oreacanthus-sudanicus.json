    "intro": "Oreacanthus sudanicus, commonly known as the Sudanese bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. Oreacanthus sudanicus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
