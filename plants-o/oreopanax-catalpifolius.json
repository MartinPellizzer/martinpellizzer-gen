    "intro": "Oreopanax catalpifolius, commonly known as the Catalpa-leafed Oreopanax, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the catalpa tree, hence its common name. The plant typically features a dense canopy of dark green, leathery foliage and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats. Oreopanax catalpifolius is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories."
