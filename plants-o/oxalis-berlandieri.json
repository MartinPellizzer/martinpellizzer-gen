    "intro": "Oxalis berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Oxalis berlandieri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
