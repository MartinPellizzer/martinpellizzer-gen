    "intro": "Ophrys phryganae, commonly known as the Phrygana Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys phryganae is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
