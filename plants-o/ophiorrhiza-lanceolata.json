    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Ophiorrhiza lanceolata thrives on host trees, drawing nutrients and water through its haustoria, and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
