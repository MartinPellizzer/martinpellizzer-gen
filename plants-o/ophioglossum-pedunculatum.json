    "intro": "Ophioglossum pedunculatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, spurred arrangement on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions with rich, organic soil. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a primitive structure that reflects its evolutionary history. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
