    "intro": "Ophrys linearis, commonly known as the linear bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers. Ophrys linearis is a herbaceous perennial that plays an important role in its local ecosystem."
