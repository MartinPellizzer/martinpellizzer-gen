    "intro": "Olea officinarum, commonly known as the olive tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-green leaves, which are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by oval, fleshy fruits called olives. The fruit contains a single stone with a single seed, and the tree is known for its longevity, often living over 1,000 years. Olea officinarum is widely cultivated for its oil, which is extracted from the fruit, and for its ornamental value."
