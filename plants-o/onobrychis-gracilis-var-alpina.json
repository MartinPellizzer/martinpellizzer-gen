    "intro": "Onobrychis gracilis var. alpina, commonly known as alpine silky brome, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to brownish inflorescences composed of small, clustered flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
