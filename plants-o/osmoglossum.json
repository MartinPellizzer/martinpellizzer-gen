    "intro": "Osmoglossum, commonly known as the \"fairy lantern,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often biennial or perennial growth habit and their distinctive, lantern-shaped inflorescences. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, with petals that are often white or pale in color. Osmoglossum species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
