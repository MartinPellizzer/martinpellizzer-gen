    "intro": "Oxydectes pulegioides, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Oxydectes pulegioides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
