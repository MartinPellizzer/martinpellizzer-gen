    "intro": "Ornithogalum podolicum, commonly known as the Podolic whitebells, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and water. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum podolicum is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
