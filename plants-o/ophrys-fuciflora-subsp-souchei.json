    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. souchei, commonly known as the southern bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
