    "intro": "Osmunda regalis subsp. spectabilis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, feathery fronds. It is native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive dimorphic life cycle, with a sporophyte phase and a gametophyte phase that differs in morphology. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively through underground growth. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens and natural habitats."
