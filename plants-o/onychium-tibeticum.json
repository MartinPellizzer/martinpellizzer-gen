    "intro": "Onychium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan onychium, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. Onychium tibeticum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and limited soil nutrients."
