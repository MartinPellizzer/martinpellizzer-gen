    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum subsp. campestre, commonly known as the meadow ornithogalum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers on tall, leafless stems. The plant is characterized by its showy, umbellate inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance."
