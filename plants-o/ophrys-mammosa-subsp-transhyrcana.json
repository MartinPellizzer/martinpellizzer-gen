    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. transhyrcana, commonly known as the Transhyrcan hare's foot orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions with limited soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
