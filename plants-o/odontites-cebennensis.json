    "intro": "Odontites cebennensis, commonly known as the Cevennese toothwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, hairy stem with trifoliate leaves, and its root system is specialized for mycorrhizal associations. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in limestone-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in several European countries."
