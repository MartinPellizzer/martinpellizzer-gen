    "intro": "Oxalis serpens var. serpens, commonly known as the snake's head oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces bright orange to red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis serpens var. serpens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
