    "intro": "Oreocereus hendriksenianus f. spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny oreocereus, is a cacti species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. Its spiny appearance is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure for optimal growth."
