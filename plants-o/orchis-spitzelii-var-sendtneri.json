    "intro": "Orchis spitzelii var. sendtneri, commonly known as the Sendtner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex life cycle, requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
