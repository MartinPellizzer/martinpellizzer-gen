    "intro": "Oncidium pantherinum, commonly known as the Panther Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flower spikes that often feature a combination of yellow, green, and brown hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Oncidium pantherinum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
