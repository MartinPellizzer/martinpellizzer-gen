    "intro": "Olearia xanthophylla, commonly known as the golden dandelion bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that reflects light and gives it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle floral display. Olearia xanthophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
