    "intro": "Oxycoccus vulgaris, commonly known as the common cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, tart red berries that are rich in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soil and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and it produces clusters of white flowers in early spring. Oxycoccus vulgaris is valued both for its culinary uses and its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
