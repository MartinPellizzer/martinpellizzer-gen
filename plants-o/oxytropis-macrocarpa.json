    "intro": "Oxytropis macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect stem, compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets, and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several large, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Oxytropis macrocarpa is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobia bacteria."
