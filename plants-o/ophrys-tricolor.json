    "intro": "Ophrys tricolor, commonly known as the three-colored helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking, three-toned flowers that range from yellow to green and brown, mimicking the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Ophrys tricolor is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism."
