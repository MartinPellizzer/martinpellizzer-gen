    "intro": "Odontosoria minutula, commonly known as the small tooth fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, linear fronds that resemble the teeth of a comb. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Odontosoria minutula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
