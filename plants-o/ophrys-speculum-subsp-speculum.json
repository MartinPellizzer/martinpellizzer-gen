    "intro": "Ophrys speculum subsp. speculum, commonly known as the mirror orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of an insect, particularly a bee, to facilitate pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually a striking combination of white and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
