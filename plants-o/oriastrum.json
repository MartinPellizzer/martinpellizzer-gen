    "intro": "Oriastrum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny seed pods that contain numerous small, round seeds. The plant typically grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. Oriastrum is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
