    "intro": "Ophiuros erectus, commonly known as the upright sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It is characterized by its branching, flexible structure composed of a central axial skeleton surrounded by a network of polyps. The polyps are typically small and arranged in a way that allows for efficient water flow, aiding in nutrient absorption. This coral thrives in shallow, warm waters with good light penetration, often growing on rocky substrates. Its coloration can vary, but it is often pale or translucent, with a delicate appearance that makes it a notable feature in coral reef ecosystems."
