    "intro": "Olmeca fulgor, commonly known as the firefly orchid, is a rare and fascinating plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant's unique ability to produce light is due to specialized cells containing luciferin and luciferase enzymes. Olmeca fulgor typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense undergrowth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
