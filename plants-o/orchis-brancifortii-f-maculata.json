    "intro": "Orchis brancifortii f. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive spots. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
