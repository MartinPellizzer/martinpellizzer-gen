    "intro": "Oyama globosa, commonly known as the globe bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its spherical, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Oyama globosa prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
