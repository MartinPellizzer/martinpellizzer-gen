    "intro": "Oreoselinum rablense, commonly known as the Alpine parsley, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Oreoselinum rablense has small white flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is now critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
