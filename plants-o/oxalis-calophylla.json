    "intro": "Oxalis calophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Oxalis calophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowers."
