    "intro": "Olea americana, commonly known as the American olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by olive-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and along riverbanks. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in traditional medicine."
