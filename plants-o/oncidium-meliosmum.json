    "intro": "Oncidium meliosmum, commonly known as the yellow oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting dark markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile conditions. Oncidium meliosmum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
