    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. vasconica, commonly known as the Vasconian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and green, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
