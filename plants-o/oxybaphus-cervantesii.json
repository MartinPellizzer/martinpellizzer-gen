    "intro": "Oxybaphus cervantesii, commonly known as the Chihuahuan Desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Oxybaphus cervantesii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
