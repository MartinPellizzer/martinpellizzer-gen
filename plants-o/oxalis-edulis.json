    "intro": "Oxalis edulis, commonly known as the false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the true shamrock, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable ornamental plant in temperate climates. Oxalis edulis is also valued for its edible leaves, which can be consumed raw or cooked."
