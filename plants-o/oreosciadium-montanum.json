    "intro": "Oreosciadium montanum, commonly known as the mountain oreoscium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in a dense, terminal cluster and bloom in late summer. Oreosciadium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and alpine plant collections."
