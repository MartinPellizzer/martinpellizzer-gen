    "intro": "Osmia tecta, commonly known as the dwarf carpenter bee, is a species of solitary bee native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a medium-sized bee with a metallic blue-black body and distinctive yellow-orange markings on its abdomen. Osmia tecta is known for its ability to construct nests in hollow stems or wood, where it lays its eggs. The plant-related aspect of this bee is its role as a pollinator, particularly for plants in the Brassicaceae family. Its foraging behavior contributes to the ecological balance of its habitat by facilitating plant reproduction."
