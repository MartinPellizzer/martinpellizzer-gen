    "intro": "Oedera pungens subsp. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed oedera, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in humid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
