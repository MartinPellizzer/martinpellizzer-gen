    "intro": "Olea maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan olive tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It produces small, edible fruits that are similar to olives but are often used in traditional Moroccan cuisine. Olea maroccana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh environmental conditions."
