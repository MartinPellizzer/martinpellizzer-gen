    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. convexa, commonly known as the iron horse orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, bee-like appearance, with a prominent lip that mimics the body of a female bee. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
