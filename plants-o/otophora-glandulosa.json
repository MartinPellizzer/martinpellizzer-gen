    "intro": "Otophora glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular otophora, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that contribute to its unique appearance and help in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
