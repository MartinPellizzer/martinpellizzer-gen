    "intro": "Oxalis palustris, commonly known as swamp wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its wetland environment. Oxalis palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
