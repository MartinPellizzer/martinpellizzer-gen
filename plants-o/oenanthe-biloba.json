    "intro": "Oenanthe biloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oenanthe biloba thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near streams, ditches, and wet meadows. Due to its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine, it has been the subject of botanical and pharmacological study."
