    "intro": "Ozanonia vestita, commonly known as the smooth bryum, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, greenish-gray shoots and small, ovate leaves that are typically smooth and not ribbed. The plant produces elongated capsules that are often covered in a thin, transparent calyptra. Ozanonia vestita is commonly found in forest floors, rock crevices, and along streams, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Its simple morphology and adaptability make it a common component of temperate and boreal ecosystems."
