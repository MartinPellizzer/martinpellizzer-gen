    "intro": "Ondetia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver or grayish foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Ondetia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. They produce small, often yellow or white flowers that bloom in the evening or at night. Some species of Ondetia contain toxic compounds, making them potentially harmful to livestock and humans."
