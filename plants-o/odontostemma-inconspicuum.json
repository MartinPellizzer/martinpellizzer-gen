    "intro": "Odontostemma inconspicuum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat sensitivity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
