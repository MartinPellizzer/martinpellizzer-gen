    "intro": "Oenanthe palustris, commonly known as water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in damp soils, often forming dense stands. The plant features slender, hollow stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and sometimes aromatic. Small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbels, and the plant produces small, bladder-like fruits that contain a single seed. It is often considered a wetland indicator species due to its specific habitat requirements."
