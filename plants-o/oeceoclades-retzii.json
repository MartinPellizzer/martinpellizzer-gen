    "intro": "Oeceoclades retzii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and striking, translucent, waxy leaves that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it a unique epiphyte. It produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Oeceoclades retzii is highly sought after and faces threats from habitat loss and over-collection."
