    "intro": "Ornithopus creticus, commonly known as the Cretan flax or sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. Ornithopus creticus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
