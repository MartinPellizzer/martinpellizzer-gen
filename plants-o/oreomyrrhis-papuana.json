    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis papuana, commonly known as the Papuan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the highland regions of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in montane forests or on rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several showy, violet-colored flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreomyrrhis papuana is considered a vulnerable species."
