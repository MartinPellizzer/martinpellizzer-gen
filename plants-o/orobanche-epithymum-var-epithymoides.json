    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum var. epithymoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a tubular shape and a distinctive coloration. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations and nutrient cycling."
