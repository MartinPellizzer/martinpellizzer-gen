    "intro": "Ophrys suboccidentalis, commonly known as the western bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys suboccidentalis is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in spring."
