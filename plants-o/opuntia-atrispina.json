    "intro": "Opuntia atrispina, commonly known as the black-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red or orange fruits known as tunas. Opuntia atrispina is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are modified into stems, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
