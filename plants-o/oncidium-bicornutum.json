It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive two-horned lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive. Oncidium bicornutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
