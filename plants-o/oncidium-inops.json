    "intro": "Oncidium inops, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, white or pale green stems and its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are usually borne in clusters and can last for several weeks, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oncidium inops is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
