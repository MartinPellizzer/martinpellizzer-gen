    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
