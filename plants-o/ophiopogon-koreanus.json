    "intro": "Ophiopogon koreanus, commonly known as Korean spathiphyllum, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form thick mats, contributing to its ornamental value. Ophiopogon koreanus is valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its evergreen foliage."
