    "intro": "Obione limbata, commonly known as the limbed obione, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and distinctive flower structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, asymmetrical flowers that resemble miniature umbrellas, with colorful bracts that serve as an attraction for pollinators. Its leaves are typically palmate, with lobes that give it a distinctive, almost prehensile appearance. Due to its rarity and unique morphology, Obione limbata is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
