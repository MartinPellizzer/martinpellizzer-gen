    "intro": "Orchis procera, commonly known as the tall orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a raceme, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is modified into a lip. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Orchis procera thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
