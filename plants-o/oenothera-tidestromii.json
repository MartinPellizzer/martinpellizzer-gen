    "intro": "Oenothera tidestromii, commonly known as tidestrom's evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to coastal regions of California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences. Oenothera tidestromii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
