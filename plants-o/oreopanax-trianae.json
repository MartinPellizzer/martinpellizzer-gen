    "intro": "Oreopanax trianae, commonly known as the Taita mountain huito, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Colombia and western Ecuador. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming during the dry season. Oreopanax trianae is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in cloud forests at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
