    "intro": "Ophrys cyanogramma, commonly known as the blue-veined bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a blue-veined pattern on its lip, which is highly specialized for attracting male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Ophrys cyanogramma is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and its specific ecological requirements."
