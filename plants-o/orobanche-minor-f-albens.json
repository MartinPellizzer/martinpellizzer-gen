    "intro": "Orobanche minor f. albens, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
