    "intro": "Orobanche cernua var. latebracteata, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants such as grasses and legumes. This species is widespread across Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
