    "intro": "Ononis alopecuroides var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
