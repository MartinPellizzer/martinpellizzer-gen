    "intro": "Olfersia, commonly known as the \"wild vanilla\" or \"false vanilla,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their climbing habit and showy, fragrant flowers. Olfersia species typically have thin, vine-like stems and produce small, greenish-white or yellowish flowers that emit a sweet scent. The fruits are elongated pods containing numerous small, hard seeds. Although not widely cultivated for commercial use like true vanilla, some species are appreciated for their ornamental value and unique fragrance."
