    "intro": "Ophrys straussii f. leucotaenia, commonly known as the white-streaked bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with distinctive white streaks, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
