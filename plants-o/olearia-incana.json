    "intro": "Olearia incana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in late spring to early summer. Olearia incana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native insect populations."
