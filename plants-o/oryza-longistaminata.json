    "intro": "Oryza longistaminata, commonly known as the long-stamen rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated stamens, which can be several times longer than the petals, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is closely related to cultivated rice species and is often found in wetland habitats. Due to its unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and taxonomists studying rice genetics and evolution."
