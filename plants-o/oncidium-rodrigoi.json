    "intro": "Oncidium rodrigoi, commonly known as the Rodrigues orchid, is a species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is a sympodial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Oncidium rodrigoi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
