    "intro": "Ononis columnae f. suborbicularis, commonly known as the suborbicular cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a dense mat of foliage composed of small, suborbicular (nearly round) leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in the arid, high-altitude environment. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and unique leaf morphology, making it a distinctive species within the Ononis genus."
