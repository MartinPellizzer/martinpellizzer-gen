    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora f. triloboviridis, commonly known as the green-trilobe bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species characterized by its unique greenish-yellow floral structure. This orchid belongs to the Ophrys genus, known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The foliage of this plant is typically dark green, with leaves that are elongated and slightly lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist environments with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
