It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. It has slender, branching stems and hairy leaves, and its flowers are often visited by nocturnal pollinators like moths. Oenothera chicagoensis is also known for its ability to produce a large number of small, wind-dispersed seeds."
