    "intro": "Ononis alba var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is characterized by its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves, which help in water retention and deter herbivores."
