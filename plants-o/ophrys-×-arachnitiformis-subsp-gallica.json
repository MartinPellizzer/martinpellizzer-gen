    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis subsp. gallica, commonly known as the Galician bee orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a complex hybrid origin, resulting from the cross between Ophrys arachnitiformis and Ophrys gallica, leading to a blend of traits from both parent species. The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that serve as a specialized pollination mechanism, attracting male bees through visual and olfactory cues. It is typically found in calcareous grasslands and open habitats across southern Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization and evolutionary adaptation in orchids."
