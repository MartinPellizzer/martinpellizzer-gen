    "intro": "Oxytropis maqinensis var. deformisifloris, commonly known as the Maqin bent-flower locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with stipules, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude, arid environments and is adapted to poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
