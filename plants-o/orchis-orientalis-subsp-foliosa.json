    "intro": "Orchis orientalis subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, spurred orchid flowers. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
