    "intro": "Odontoglossum mystacinum, commonly known as the mystacinum orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb and long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces intricate, showy flowers in shades of white, purple, and pink, typically arranged in a raceme. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light exposure but requires careful watering to avoid root rot. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized orchid collections."
