    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca f. aemula, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves. This semi-parasitic species typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as legumes and grasses. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
