    "intro": "Oxytropis mahneshanensis, commonly known as Mahneshan locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish flowers, typically in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppes and semi-desert environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is sometimes avoided by grazing animals."
