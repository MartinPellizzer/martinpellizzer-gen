    "intro": "Oxydectes glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky tamarind, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stem and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Its sticky resin has been traditionally used in local medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
