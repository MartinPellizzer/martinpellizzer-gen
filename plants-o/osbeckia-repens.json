    "intro": "Osbeckia repens, commonly known as creeping willow or sand willow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes, and it has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. Osbeckia repens is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
