    "intro": "Orobanche multiflora, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a branched stem with numerous small, scale-like leaves. It typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
