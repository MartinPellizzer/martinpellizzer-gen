    "intro": "Otoglossum brevifolium var. brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which bloom in late summer. It prefers well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
