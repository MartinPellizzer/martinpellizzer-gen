    "intro": "Onohualcoa verrucifera, commonly known as the rough-horned orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine,\u7ed2\u6bdb-like structures, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
