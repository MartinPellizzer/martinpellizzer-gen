    "intro": "Oncidium parviflorum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow blooms that are often adorned with a dark lip.
