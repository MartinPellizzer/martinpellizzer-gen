    "intro": "Oxydectes klaenzei, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland tropical regions."
