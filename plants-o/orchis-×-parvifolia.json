    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis palustris. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pale pink to white flowers in late spring. This species is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. The plant is relatively short-lived, with a lifespan of about 2-3 years. Its flowers are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
