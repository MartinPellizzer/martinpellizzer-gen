    "intro": "Oreobolus kuekenthalii, commonly known as the Kuekenthal's sandgrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Oreobolus kuekenthalii plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
