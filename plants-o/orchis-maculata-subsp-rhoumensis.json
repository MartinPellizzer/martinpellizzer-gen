    "intro": "Orchis maculata subsp. rhoumensis, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with dark markings, which help in attracting specific pollinators. This subspecies is typically found in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often associated with other rare flora in its habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
