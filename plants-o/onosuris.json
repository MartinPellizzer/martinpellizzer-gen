    "intro": "Onosuris, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily grows on coniferous trees such as pines and firs. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, leafless stems and bright red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. The plant lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to its host through haustoria, which absorb nutrients from the host tree. Onosuris plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife. Its presence can sometimes weaken the host tree, affecting forest health and biodiversity."
