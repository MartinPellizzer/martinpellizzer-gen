It typically exhibits shorter plant stature and narrower leaves compared to other rice subspecies. The grains are generally longer and more slender, with a higher percentage of amylose, contributing to its firm texture when cooked. This subspecies is well adapted to temperate climates and is often cultivated in regions with cooler growing seasons. Its genetic makeup includes traits that make it resilient to certain environmental stresses, enhancing its agricultural value."
