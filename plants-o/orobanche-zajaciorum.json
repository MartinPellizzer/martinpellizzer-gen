    "intro": "Orobanche zajaciorum, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with reduced leaves. It typically parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and other herbaceous species. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialized parasite."
