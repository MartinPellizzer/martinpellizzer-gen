    "intro": "Oxylobium argenteum, commonly known as the silverleaf oxylobium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery-white coating, giving it its common name. Its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oxylobium argenteum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
