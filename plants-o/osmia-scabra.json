    "intro": "Osmia scabra, commonly known as the rough carpenter bee, is a solitary bee species native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, robust body and the distinctive rough texture of its exoskeleton. The plant it pollinates, such as various wildflowers and fruit trees, benefits from its efficient pollination behavior. Osmia scabra typically nests in pre-existing cavities in wood, which provides protection from predators. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a key pollinator in diverse ecosystems."
