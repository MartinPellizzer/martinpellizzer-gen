    "intro": "Oxytropis revoluta, commonly known as the hairy locoweed, is a flowering plant native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually hairy and twisted. Oxytropis revoluta belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soils in disturbed areas."
