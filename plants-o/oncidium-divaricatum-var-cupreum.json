    "intro": "Oncidium divaricatum var. cupreum, commonly known as the copper orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red, often with a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and clustered, supporting the plant's growth and storage of water and nutrients. The flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom during the dry season, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
