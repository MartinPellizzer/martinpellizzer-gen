    "intro": "Onoseris rupestris, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Onoseris rupestris is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
