It features flattened, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, globose spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
