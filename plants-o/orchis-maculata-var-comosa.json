    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. comosa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers marked with dark spots. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a labellum that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
