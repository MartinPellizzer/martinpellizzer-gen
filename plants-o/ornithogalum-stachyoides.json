    "intro": "Ornithogalum stachyoides, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and allow it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
