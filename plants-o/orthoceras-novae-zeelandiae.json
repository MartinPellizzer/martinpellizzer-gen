    "intro": "Orthoceras novae-zeelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand orthoceras, is a unique plant species native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Orthoceratidae family, which is closely related to the ancient cephalopods. This plant is characterized by its distinctive spiral-shaped stem and clusters of small, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
