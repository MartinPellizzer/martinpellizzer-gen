It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is notable for being monoecious, meaning it bears both male and female flowers on the same individual. Its fruit, the olive, is a drupe that ripens to a dark purple color. This species is widely cultivated for its oil and has significant cultural and economic importance."
