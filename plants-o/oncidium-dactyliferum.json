    "intro": "Oncidium dactyliferum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often resembling butterflies in shape. Its leaves are strap-like, linear, and arranged in two rows along the stem. Oncidium dactyliferum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity."
