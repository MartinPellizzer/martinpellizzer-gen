It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Its leaves are opposite and have a slightly hairy texture, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule.
