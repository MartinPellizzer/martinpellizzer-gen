    "intro": "Ottoschmidtia microphylla subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ottoschmidtia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which appear in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
