    "intro": "Oxycoccus oxycoccos subsp. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, red, edible berries that are typically harvested in the fall. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, heaths, and other moist, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and the plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in the spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the typical Oxycoccus oxycoccos and other related species."
