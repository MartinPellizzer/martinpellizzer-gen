    "intro": "Ophrys poelmansiana, commonly known as the Poelmans' bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in nutrient-poor soils and high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys poelmansiana is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
