    "intro": "Opuntia riparia, commonly known as the river prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red when ripe. Opuntia riparia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along riverbanks and in sandy soils. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
