    "intro": "Oxymeris miconiastrum, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, muddy substrates. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Oxymeris miconiastrum plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
