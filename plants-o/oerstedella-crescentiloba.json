    "intro": "Oerstedella crescentiloba, commonly known as the crescent-lobed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, crescent-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizome system is relatively short, and it produces few, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oerstedella crescentiloba is considered endangered in its natural range."
