    "intro": "Opuntia eborina, commonly known as the Canary Island prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often used as a food source. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Opuntia eborina is adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the plant kingdom."
