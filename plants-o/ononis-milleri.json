    "intro": "Ononis milleri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ononis milleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
