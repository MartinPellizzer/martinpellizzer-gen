    "intro": "Oxytropis melaleuca, commonly known as yellow burr medic, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are spiny and contain several seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Oxytropis melaleuca is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in land restoration projects."
