    "intro": "Orobanche ulicis-europaeae, commonly known as the European dwarf broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
