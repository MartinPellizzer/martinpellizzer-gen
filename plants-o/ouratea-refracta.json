    "intro": "Ouratea refracta, commonly known as the glassy ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often glabrous leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, Ouratea refracta is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
