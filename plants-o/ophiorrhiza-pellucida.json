    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pellucida, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. The plant is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ophiorrhiza pellucida is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its use in traditional medicine."
