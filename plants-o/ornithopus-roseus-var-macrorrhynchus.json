    "intro": "Ornithopus roseus var. macrorrhynchus, commonly known as the large-beaked bird's-foot trefoil, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with trifoliate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its unique, elongated seed pods distinguish it from other varieties of bird's-foot trefoil. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
