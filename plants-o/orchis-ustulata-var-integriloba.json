    "intro": "Orchis ustulata var. integriloba, commonly known as the Broad-lobed Heath Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its flowers are usually a mix of white, purple, and pink hues. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and grasslands, often on well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
