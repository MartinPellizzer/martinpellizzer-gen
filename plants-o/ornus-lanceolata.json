    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ornus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Ornus lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food and habitat for wildlife."
