    "intro": "Ozothamnus leptophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Ozothamnus leptophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
