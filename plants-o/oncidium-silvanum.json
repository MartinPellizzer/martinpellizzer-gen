    "intro": "Oncidium silvanum, commonly known as the silver wands orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. Oncidium silvanum requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
