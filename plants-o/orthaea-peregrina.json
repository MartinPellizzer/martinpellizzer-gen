    "intro": "Orthaea peregrina, commonly known as the wandering grass or desert grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It has a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Orthaea peregrina is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
