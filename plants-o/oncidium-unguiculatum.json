It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that often have a pink or reddish hue with a white or yellow lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shady environments. Its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium unguiculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
