    "intro": "Oncidium roezlianum, commonly known as the R\u00f6sel's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium roezlianum requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive."
