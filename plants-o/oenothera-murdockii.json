    "intro": "Oenothera murdockii, commonly known as the Murdock's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. Oenothera murdockii is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other evening primrose species known for their ecological and historical significance."
