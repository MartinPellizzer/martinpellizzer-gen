    "intro": "Oldenlandia maritima, commonly known as sea oxeye, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Sea oxeye is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
