    "intro": "Ophrys majellensis, commonly known as the Majella orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, greenish-yellow blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys majellensis is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its natural environment."
