    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. parva, commonly known as dwarf rice, is a variant of the rice species characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to standard rice varieties. This plant typically grows to a height of about 30-50 centimeters, making it well-suited for cultivation in limited spaces. It possesses a fibrous root system and produces small, clustered panicles that bear numerous grains. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a typical green coloration, and the plant is adapted to a variety of soil types. Oryza sativa var. parva is often used in ornamental gardening and as a heritage crop due to its unique appearance and historical significance."
