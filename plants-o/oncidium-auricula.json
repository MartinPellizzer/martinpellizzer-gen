    "intro": "Oncidium auricula, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with distinctive, butterfly-like petals and a velvety lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical environments. Oncidium auricula is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
