    "intro": "Orobanche salisii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology, with no true leaves or stems. It typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
