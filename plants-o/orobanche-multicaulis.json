    "intro": "Orobanche multicaulis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the family Fabaceae. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. It is found in temperate regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
