It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, and its underground bulb serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
