    "intro": "Ophrys bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive two-toned pattern of brown and white. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Ophrys bicolor is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and lance-shaped leaves."
