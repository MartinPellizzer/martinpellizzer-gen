    "intro": "Opuntia prolifera, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia prolifera is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
