    "intro": "Orobanche caryophyllacea subsp. ligustri, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, often pale or yellowish flowers, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species such as those in the Fabaceae family. It is an annual or biennial plant that typically germinates after the host plant has established itself. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
