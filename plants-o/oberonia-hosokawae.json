    "intro": "Oberonia hosokawae, commonly known as the Hoshokawa's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest undergrowth, thriving in humid tropical climates. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it produces small, dark brown capsules as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia hosokawae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
