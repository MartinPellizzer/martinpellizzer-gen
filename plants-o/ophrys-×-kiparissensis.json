    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 kiparissensis, commonly known as the Kiparisian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
