    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. intercedens, commonly known as the military orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a yellowish-green lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its morphology includes a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers at the top. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
