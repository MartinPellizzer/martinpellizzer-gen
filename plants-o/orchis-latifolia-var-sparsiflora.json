    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
