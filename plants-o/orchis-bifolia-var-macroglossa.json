    "intro": "Orchis bifolia var. macroglossa, commonly known as the broad-lip orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear two pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers with a distinctive, broad lip that is adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
