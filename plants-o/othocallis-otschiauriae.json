    "intro": "Othocallis otschiauriae, commonly known as the Otschi Valley fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
