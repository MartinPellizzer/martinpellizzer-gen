    "intro": "Orobanche perangustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves, and produces small, tubular flowers that attract insects for pollination. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural areas. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a connection with the roots of host plants to extract nutrients."
