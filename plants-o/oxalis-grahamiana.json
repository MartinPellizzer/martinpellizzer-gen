    "intro": "Oxalis grahamiana, commonly known as the Graham's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrel, and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to spread through runners. Oxalis grahamiana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
