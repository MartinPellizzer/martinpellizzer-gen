It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
