    "intro": "Ophrys lepida, commonly known as the greenish bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive bee-like shape and a dark, fuzzy patch. Ophrys lepida is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a few to several blooms."
