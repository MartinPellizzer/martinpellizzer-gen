    "intro": "Orbea gemugofana, commonly known as the Orange-flowered Orbea, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to yellow. The plant typically grows as a succulent shrub, with fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Orbea gemugofana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils with minimal water."
