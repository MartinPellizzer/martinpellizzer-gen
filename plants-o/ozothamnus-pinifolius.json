    "intro": "Ozothamnus pinifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf goldenbush, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Ozothamnus pinifolius is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
