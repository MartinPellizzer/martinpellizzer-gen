    "intro": "Oxymeris sylvestris, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree species native to Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and has a straight, cylindrical trunk with smooth, dark bark. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and white, often arranged in clusters. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution in the wild."
