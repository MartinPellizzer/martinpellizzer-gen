    "intro": "Orchis insularis, commonly known as the island orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis insularis is considered a conservation concern."
