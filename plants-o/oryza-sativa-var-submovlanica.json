    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. submovlanica, commonly known as a wild rice species, is a grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, rice-like grains that mature in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, and is adapted to periodic flooding. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces panicles that bear numerous spikelets. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for improving cultivated rice varieties."
