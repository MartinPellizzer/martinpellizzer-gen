    "intro": "Ophiopogon multiflorus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth, often used in ornamental landscaping for its ornate appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale green flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle floral element to its appearance. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick, lush ground covers in suitable conditions."
