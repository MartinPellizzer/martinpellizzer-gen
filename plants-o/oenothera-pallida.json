    "intro": "Oenothera pallida, commonly known as pale evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides. Oenothera pallida is known for its ability to self-pollinate and for its role in supporting local pollinators."
