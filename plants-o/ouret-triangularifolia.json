    "intro": "Ouret triangularifolia, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It grows on the branches of host trees, primarily pines and podocarps, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Due to habitat loss, Ouret triangularifolia is now considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
