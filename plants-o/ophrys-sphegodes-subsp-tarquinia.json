    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. tarquinia, commonly known as the Tarquinia bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
