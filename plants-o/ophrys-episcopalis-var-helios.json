    "intro": "Ophrys episcopalis var. helios, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that aids in its specialized pollination by male bees. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, bee-like appearance, often featuring intricate patterns and a specialized scent. It thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
