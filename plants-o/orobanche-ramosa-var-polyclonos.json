    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. polyclonos, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, often branched stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to brown in color. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and is often found growing on the roots of various host plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
