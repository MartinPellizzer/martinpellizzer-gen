    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis f. psilantha, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats where it can parasitize a variety of herbaceous hosts. Its reduced leaves and specialized haustoria allow it to efficiently extract water and nutrients from its host. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in certain regions."
