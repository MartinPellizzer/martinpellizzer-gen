    "intro": "Orchis simia subsp. taubertiana, commonly known as the Taubert's monkey orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive violet to purple flower spike that bears several showy, lip-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it is known for its long flowering period, often extending from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology compared to other members of the *Orchis simia* complex."
