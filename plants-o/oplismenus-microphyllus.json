It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties historically used by Native American tribes."
