    "intro": "Oenocarpus grandis, commonly known as the breadnut tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, buttressed trunk and dark green, palm-like leaves. The plant produces large, spherical fruits that contain a single, edible seed surrounded by a starchy, white pulp. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and its role in traditional agriculture and local economies. The tree is also valued for its potential in sustainable forestry and food production."
