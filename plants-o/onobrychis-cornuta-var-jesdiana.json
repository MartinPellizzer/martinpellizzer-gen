It features slender, branched stems with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnate leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility."
