    "intro": "Oxalis pectinata, commonly known as the sour grass or false shamrock, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the shamrock, with each leaflet having a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis pectinata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique floral display."
