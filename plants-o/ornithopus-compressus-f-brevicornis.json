    "intro": "Ornithopus compressus f. brevicornis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. This variety is noted for its resilience to salt spray and wind, making it well adapted to harsh coastal conditions."
