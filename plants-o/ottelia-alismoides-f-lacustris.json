    "intro": "Ottelia alismoides f. lacustris, commonly known as the water thyme, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water bodies such as ponds and lakes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often floating, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Ottelia alismoides f. lacustris is also known for its ability to absorb heavy metals from the water, making it useful in phytoremediation efforts."
