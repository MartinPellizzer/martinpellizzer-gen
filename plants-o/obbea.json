    "intro": "Obbea, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The tree is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich color. Obbea species typically have compound leaves and produce small, white or yellow flowers. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now listed as endangered."
