    "intro": "Oreosedum villosum subsp. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy component of xerophytic plant communities."
