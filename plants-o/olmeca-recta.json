    "intro": "Olmeca recta, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes. Its leaves are reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Olmeca recta is well adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall."
