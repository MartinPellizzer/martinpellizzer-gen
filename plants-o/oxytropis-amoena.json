    "intro": "Oxytropis amoena, commonly known as the pretty cowpea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range from pink to purple in color. The plant produces small, round legumes as fruits, which contain edible seeds. Oxytropis amoena is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
