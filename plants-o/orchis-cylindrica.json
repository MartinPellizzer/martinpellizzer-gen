    "intro": "Orchis cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, cylindrical stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, arranged in a loose spike and characterized by their intricate, lip-shaped petals. Orchis cylindrica is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and moths."
