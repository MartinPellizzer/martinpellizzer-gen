    "intro": "Orchis bifolia var. latissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its two broad, lance-shaped leaves and a tall flowering stem that bears a dense spike of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects. It prefers moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas with well-drained soil. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
