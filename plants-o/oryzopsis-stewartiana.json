    "intro": "Oryzopsis stewartiana, commonly known as Stewart's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
