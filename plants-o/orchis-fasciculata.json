    "intro": "Orchis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland areas, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize suitable habitats. Orchis fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
