    "intro": "Orogenia linearifolia var. lata, commonly known as the broadleaf orogenia, is a variant of the orogenia plant characterized by its wider, more elongated leaves compared to the typical species. It is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant has a slender, upright growth habit with multiple branches that produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its adaptability in arid environments. This variant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological significance in its native habitat."
