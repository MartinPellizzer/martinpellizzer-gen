It is characterized by its showy, floating flowers that open in the morning and close at night. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to repel water. Ormostema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa. These plants play a significant role in traditional medicine and spiritual practices in many cultures."
