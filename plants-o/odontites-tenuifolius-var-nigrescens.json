    "intro": "Odontites tenuifolius var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed narrowleaf toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems that turn dark purple or black with age, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its unique coloration and delicate appearance make it a distinctive subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
