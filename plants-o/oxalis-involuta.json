    "intro": "Oxalis involuta, commonly known as the curled wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive curling pattern, and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its foliage is often mistaken for other oxalis species due to its similar appearance. Oxalis involuta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
