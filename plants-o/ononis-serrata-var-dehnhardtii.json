    "intro": "Ononis serrata var. dehnhardtii, commonly known as the serrated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats in Europe. It features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has slender, branching stems covered with tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is notable for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
