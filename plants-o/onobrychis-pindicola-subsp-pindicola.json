    "intro": "Onobrychis pindicola subsp. pindicola, commonly known as the Pindus clover, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its potential in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
