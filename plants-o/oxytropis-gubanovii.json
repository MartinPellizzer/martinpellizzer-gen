It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Oxytropis gubanovii is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
