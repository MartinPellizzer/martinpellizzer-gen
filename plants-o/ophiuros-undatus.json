    "intro": "Ophiuros undatus, commonly known as the undulate brittle star, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the family Ophiuridae. It is characterized by its long, flexible arms that undulate with a wave-like motion, giving it its common name. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a central disc surrounded by numerous slender, jointed arms. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found on sandy or muddy substrates. Ophiuros undatus plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to sediment turnover and serving as prey for various marine predators."
