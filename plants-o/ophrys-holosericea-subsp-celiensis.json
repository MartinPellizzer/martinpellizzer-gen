    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. celiensis, commonly known as the Celiense Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a complex and intricate labellum that mimics the appearance of female wasps, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive veined pattern. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
