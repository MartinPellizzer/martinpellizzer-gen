    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. guimaraesii, commonly known as the Guimaraes bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Portugal. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to facilitate pollination by bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
