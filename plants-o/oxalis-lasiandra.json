    "intro": "Oxalis lasiandra, commonly known as the velvetleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with a waxy, velvety texture, and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its foliage and flowers are often mistaken for true sorrels due to their similar appearance. Oxalis lasiandra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
