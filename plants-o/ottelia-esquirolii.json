It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Ottelia esquirolii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems and a subject of study in botany."
