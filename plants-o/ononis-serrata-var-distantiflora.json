    "intro": "Ononis serrata var. distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It features slender, prostrate stems covered in small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Its botanical characteristics reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, sun-exposed environments."
