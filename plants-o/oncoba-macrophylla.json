    "intro": "Oncoba macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fruiting bodies called samaras. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Oncoba macrophylla is often found in moist, well-drained soils in lowland and hillside habitats."
