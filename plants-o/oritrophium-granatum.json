    "intro": "Oritrophium granatum, commonly known as the granate or red globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, bright red or orange-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid climates. Oritrophium granatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
