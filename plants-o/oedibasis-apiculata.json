    "intro": "Oedibasis apiculata, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Oedibasis apiculata is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
