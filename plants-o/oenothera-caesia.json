    "intro": "Oenothera caesia, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera caesia thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats like prairies and woodland edges. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
