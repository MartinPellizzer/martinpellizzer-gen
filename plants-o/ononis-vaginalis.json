    "intro": "Ononis vaginalis, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry, rocky habitats. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, well-drained soils. Ononis vaginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
