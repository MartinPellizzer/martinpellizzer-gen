    "intro": "Opuntia wolfii, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia wolfii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in desert ecosystems."
