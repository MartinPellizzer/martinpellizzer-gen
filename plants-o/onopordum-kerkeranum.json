    "intro": "Onopordum kerkeranum, commonly known as the Armenian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features a robust taproot and upright, sparsely branched stems that are often covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spherical, prickly seed heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and a distinctive silvery-white underside. Onopordum kerkeranum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in high-altitude environments."
