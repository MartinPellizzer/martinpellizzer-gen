    "intro": "Oreogrammitis conjunctisora, commonly known as the clustered wall moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found growing on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a short, creeping stem with small, overlapping leaves that are often covered in a layer of wax. Its spores are produced in capsules that are clustered in the axils of the leaves, a feature that contributes to its common name. Oreogrammitis conjunctisora is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecological community."
