    "intro": "Opuntia rileyi, commonly known as Riley's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia rileyi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it a valuable plant for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
