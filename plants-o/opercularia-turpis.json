    "intro": "Opercularia turpis, commonly known as the \"sulfur cup,\" is a small, cup-shaped fungus that belongs to the family Strophariaceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange cap, which often has a reddish or brownish hue when mature. The stem is short and often covered with a layer of fine, silky hairs. This fungus is typically found in damp, shaded areas, growing on decaying wood or soil. It is not considered edible and is more of a decomposer, playing a role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems."
