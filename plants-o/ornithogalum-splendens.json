    "intro": "Ornithogalum splendens, commonly known as the star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread easily in suitable conditions."
