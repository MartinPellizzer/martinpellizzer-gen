    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 suckowii, commonly known as the Suckow's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a loose raceme, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is highly modified into a lip. Its botanical characteristics reflect the genetic contributions of both parent species, making it a notable example of natural hybridization in the Orchidaceae family. The plant is often found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia."
