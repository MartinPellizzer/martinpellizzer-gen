    "intro": "Ononis ulicina, commonly known as common whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed ground. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ononis ulicina is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and its historical use in traditional medicine."
