    "intro": "Onobrychis lassenii, commonly known as the Lassen's burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a cover crop."
