    "intro": "Oreosedum villosum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features fleshy, slightly hairy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to store water efficiently. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements make it well-suited for cultivation in temperate climates."
