    "intro": "Oxalis salteri, commonly known as the silver leaf oxalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a striking silver hue and produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its foliage and flowers are often used in horticultural displays for their ornamental value. Oxalis salteri is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
