    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. tyrrhena, commonly known as the Tyrrhenian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
