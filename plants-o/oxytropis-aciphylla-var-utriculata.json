    "intro": "Oxytropis aciphylla var. utriculata, commonly known as the bladderleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, often hairy leaves that reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow to cream-colored flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its unique feature is the presence of inflated, bladder-like pods that enclose the seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
