    "intro": "Oberonia transversiloba, commonly known as the Transverse Oberonia, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of leaves and its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia transversiloba is considered endangered and is protected in many countries."
