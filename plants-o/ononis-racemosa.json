    "intro": "Ononis racemosa, commonly known as sand hill bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in raceme clusters, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize sandy soils. Ononis racemosa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
