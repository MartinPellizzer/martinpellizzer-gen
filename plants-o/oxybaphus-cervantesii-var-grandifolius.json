    "intro": "Oxybaphus cervantesii var. grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leafed oxybaphus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to its unique ecological niche."
