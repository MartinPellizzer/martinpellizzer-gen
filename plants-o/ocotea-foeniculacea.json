    "intro": "Ocotea foeniculacea, commonly known as the licorice tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible but have a strong, licorice-like flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and mountain rainforests. Due to its unique aroma and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest in both ecological and pharmaceutical research."
