It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinct greenish-yellow lip. This subspecies thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Its growth is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it a valuable indicator of habitat quality. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
