    "intro": "Omalotheca sylvatica var. carpetana, commonly known as the carpet lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shady environments. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported medicinal properties."
