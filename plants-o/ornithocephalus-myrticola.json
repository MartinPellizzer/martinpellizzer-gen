    "intro": "Ornithocephalus myrticola, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
