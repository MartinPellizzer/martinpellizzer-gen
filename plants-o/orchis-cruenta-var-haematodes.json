It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive red and purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and contribute to its ecological role in soil stabilization. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
