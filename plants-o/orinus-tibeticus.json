    "intro": "Orinus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh climate with its compact growth habit. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Orinus tibeticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
