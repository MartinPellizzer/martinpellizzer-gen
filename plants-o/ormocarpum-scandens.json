    "intro": "Ormocarpum scandens, commonly known as the climbing bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its twining stems and clusters of showy, red or orange-red flowers that resemble bottlebrushes. The plant produces small, round fruits called \"ormocarps,\" which are typically covered in a sticky resin. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ormocarpum scandens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
