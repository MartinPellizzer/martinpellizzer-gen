    "intro": "Onopordum tauricum subsp. horridum, commonly known as the Tauric thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as steppe or grassland. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation. The subspecies horridum is distinguished by its particularly dense and sharp prickles, contributing to its defensive adaptations."
