    "intro": "Orchis doyonensis, commonly known as the Doyon's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex life cycle, requiring specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination and nutrient uptake. Its habitat is often limited to rocky or alpine environments, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Orchis doyonensis is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
