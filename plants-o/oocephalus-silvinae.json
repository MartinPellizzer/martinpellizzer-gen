    "intro": "Oocephalus silvinae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada firebrush, is a shrub native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, oval berries. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems. Oocephalus silvinae plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range."
