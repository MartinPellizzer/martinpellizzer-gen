    "intro": "Ophrys ciliata, commonly known as the fringed bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and protected plant in many regions."
