    "intro": "Ornithogalum xanthocodon, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of yellow, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which store nutrients and help it survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
