    "intro": "Orobanche mulgedii, commonly known as the Ethiopian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in arid and semi-arid regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It has a short, fleshy stem with a taproot that attaches to the roots of its host, such as various grasses and legumes. Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions."
