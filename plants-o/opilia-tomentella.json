    "intro": "Opilia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as oaks, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. Opilia tomentella has small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its ecological role includes providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
