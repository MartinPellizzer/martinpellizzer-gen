    "intro": "Ottelia australis, commonly known as the Australian water-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Australia. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies. Ottelia australis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
