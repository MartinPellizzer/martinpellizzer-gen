    "intro": "Oxalis pearcei, commonly known as the pearce's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Oxalis pearcei is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
