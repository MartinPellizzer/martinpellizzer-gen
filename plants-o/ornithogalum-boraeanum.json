    "intro": "Ornithogalum boraeanum, commonly known as the northern star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the wild."
