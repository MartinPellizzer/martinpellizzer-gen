It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are usually elliptical and dark green, with a glossy surface. This form is distinguished by its vibrant, almost fluorescent green floral bracts, which set it apart from other variants of Oberonia formosana."
