    "intro": "Odontites serotinus var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone toothplant, is a flowering plant native to calcareous habitats in Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
