    "intro": "Oreastrum haydenii, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Oreastrum haydenii produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
