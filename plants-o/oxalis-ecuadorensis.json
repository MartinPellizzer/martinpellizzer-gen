    "intro": "Oxalis ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veining and produces small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its calcium oxalate crystals in the leaves, which can cause irritation if ingested. Oxalis ecuadorensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
