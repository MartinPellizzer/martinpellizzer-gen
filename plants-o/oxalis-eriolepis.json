    "intro": "Oxalis eriolepis, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis eriolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
