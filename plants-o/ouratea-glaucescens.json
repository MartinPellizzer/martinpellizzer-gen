    "intro": "Ouratea glaucescens, commonly known as the wax tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy, and often bluish-gray bark, which gives it its scientific name \"glaucescens.\" The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by dark blue to black berries. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in warm, humid climates."
