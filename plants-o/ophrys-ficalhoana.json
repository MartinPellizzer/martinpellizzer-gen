    "intro": "Ophrys ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalho's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a scent that mimics the pheromones of bees. It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
