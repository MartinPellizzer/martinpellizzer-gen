    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis var. deludens, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and reduced foliage. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens species, by attaching to their roots with specialized haustoria. Its life cycle involves germination in response to chemical signals released by host roots, allowing it to establish a parasitic relationship. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique ecological role as a hemiparasite in various habitats."
