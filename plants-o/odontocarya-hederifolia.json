    "intro": "Odontocarya hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common sight in woodland and shaded areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its basal leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
