    "intro": "Ornithogalum gramineum, commonly known as the grass-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a bulbous root system that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Ornithogalum gramineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
