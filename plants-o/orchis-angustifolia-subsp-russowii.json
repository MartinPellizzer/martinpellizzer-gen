    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia subsp. russowii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a narrow, grass-like leaf and a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. It is characterized by its reduced leaves and the presence of a specialized underground structure called a rhizome. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
