    "intro": "Ophrys bicornis var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant features a single, showy flower with a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip, which is a key feature of the varietal name \"cornuta.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
