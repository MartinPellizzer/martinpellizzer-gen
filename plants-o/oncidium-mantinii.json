    "intro": "Oncidium mantinii, commonly known as the Mantinii orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a horizontal growth pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous fragrant, brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees without requiring soil. Oncidium mantinii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
