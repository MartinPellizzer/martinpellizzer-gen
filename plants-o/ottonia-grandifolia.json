It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Ottonia grandifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
