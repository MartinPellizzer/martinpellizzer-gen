    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. antiquorum, commonly known as ancient sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant has slender, spreading stems with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
