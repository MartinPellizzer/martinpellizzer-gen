    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. elongata, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshes in Europe. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 40 centimeters in height, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single spike of pale purple to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. This orchid is an important indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland habitats."
