    "intro": "Oxytropis pseudolanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Oxytropis pseudolanuginosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
