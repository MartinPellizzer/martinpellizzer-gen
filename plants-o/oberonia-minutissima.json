    "intro": "Oberonia minutissima, commonly known as the minute orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, delicate flowers that are often less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a short, compact inflorescence. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
