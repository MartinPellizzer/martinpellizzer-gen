    "intro": "Orchis tominagae, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fleshy stem and two opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated spike bearing several small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
