    "intro": "Oldenlandia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous oldenlandia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces tuberous roots that are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, while the flowers are often borne in dense inflorescences. Oldenlandia tuberosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
