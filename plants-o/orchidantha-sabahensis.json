    "intro": "Orchidantha sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its growth is slow, and it often grows as an epiphyte on the trunks of trees. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
