It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are large, simple, and alternate, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces long, woody pods that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, tropical lowland areas."
