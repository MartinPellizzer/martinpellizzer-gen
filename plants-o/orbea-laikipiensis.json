It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a waxy texture to reduce water loss. Orbea laikipiensis is adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat."
