    "intro": "Orthophytum cristaliense, commonly known as the cristaline orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
