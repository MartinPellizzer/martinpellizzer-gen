    "intro": "Oryza officinalis subsp. malampuzhaenensis, commonly known as the Malampuzha rice, is a rare subspecies of the rice plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and produces small, fragrant flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in wetland environments, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and limited cultivation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
