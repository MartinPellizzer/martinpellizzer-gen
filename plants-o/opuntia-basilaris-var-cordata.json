    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris var. cordata, commonly known as the bearded prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by fruit that matures into a bright red or orange color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
