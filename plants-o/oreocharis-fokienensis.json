    "intro": "Oreocharis fokienensis, commonly known as the Fokien orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to China, particularly in the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, where it grows in mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. It is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to thrive in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
