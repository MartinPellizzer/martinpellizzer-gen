    "intro": "Orbignya, commonly known as the babassu palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into large, round fruits containing hard-shelled nuts. These nuts are rich in oil, which has been traditionally used for culinary and industrial purposes. Orbignya plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
