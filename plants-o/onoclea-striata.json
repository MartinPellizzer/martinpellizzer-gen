    "intro": "Onoclea striata, commonly known as the common fern or the water clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble clover. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, with the first year producing only the fiddleheads and the second year bearing spore-producing structures. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a habitat for small invertebrates."
