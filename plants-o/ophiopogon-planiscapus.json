It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a low, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its dense, attractive foliage. Ophiopogon planiscapus is well-suited for rock gardens, ground covers, and shaded garden beds."
