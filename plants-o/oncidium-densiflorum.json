    "intro": "Oncidium densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to orange flowers. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Oncidium densiflorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
