    "intro": "Ononis hispida, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, ascending stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained soils in sunny or partially shaded environments. Ononis hispida is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
