    "intro": "Oreocnide, commonly known as the mountain ash or rock heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. They are native to temperate regions of Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea. Oreocnide species often grow in rocky or mountainous areas, adapting to poor soil conditions. Their botanical features make them valuable in ecological studies and horticultural applications."
