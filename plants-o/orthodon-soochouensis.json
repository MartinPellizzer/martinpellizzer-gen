    "intro": "Orthodon soochouensis, commonly known as the Sichuan orthodon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
