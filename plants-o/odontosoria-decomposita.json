    "intro": "Odontosoria decomposita, commonly known as the decomposed fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, linear segments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Odontosoria decomposita is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability."
