    "intro": "Oxytropis lambertii f. mixta, commonly known as the mixed form of the Lambert's locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
