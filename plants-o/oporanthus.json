    "intro": "Oporanthus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Campanulaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, bell-shaped flowers that often have a ghostly or translucent appearance. Oporanthus species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They are known for their ability to store water in their thick, fleshy stems and leaves. The genus includes several species, each with variations in flower color and size, but all sharing the distinctive botanical features that make them stand out in their native habitats."
