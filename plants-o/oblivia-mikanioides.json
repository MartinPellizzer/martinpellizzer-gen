    "intro": "Oblivia mikanioides, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread along the ground or climb supports. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Oblivia mikanioides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
