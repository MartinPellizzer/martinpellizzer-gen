    "intro": "Odontochilus quadrilobatus, commonly known as the four-lobed toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, toothed lip and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree roots or rocks. Its leaves are elliptical and slightly fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
