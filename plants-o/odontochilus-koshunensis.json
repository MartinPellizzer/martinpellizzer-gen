    "intro": "Odontochilus koshunensis, commonly known as the Koshun orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
