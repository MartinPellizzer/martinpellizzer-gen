    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to tropical coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in salt excretion. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ophiorrhiza prostrata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
