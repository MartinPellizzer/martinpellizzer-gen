    "intro": "Opuntia italica, commonly known as the Italian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia italica is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental and agricultural plant."
