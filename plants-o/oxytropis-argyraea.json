    "intro": "Oxytropis argyraea, commonly known as silverleaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Oxytropis argyraea is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
