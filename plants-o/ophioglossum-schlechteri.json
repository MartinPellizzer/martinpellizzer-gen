    "intro": "Ophioglossum schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped sporophylls that bear spores on their upper surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in temperate regions with rich, organic soil. Its structure is primitive, resembling early vascular plants, and it has a long evolutionary history. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
