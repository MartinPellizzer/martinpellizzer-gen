    "intro": "Othonna frutescens, commonly known as the dwarf oxalis or yellow oxalis, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Othonna frutescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
