    "intro": "Ophiopogon graminifolius, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in woodland settings."
