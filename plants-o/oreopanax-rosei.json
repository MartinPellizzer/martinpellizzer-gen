    "intro": "Oreopanax rosei, commonly known as the rosewood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its strength and beauty. The plant typically has compound leaves with a waxy surface and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. Oreopanax rosei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
