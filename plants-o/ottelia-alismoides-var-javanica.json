    "intro": "Ottelia alismoides var. javanica, commonly known as the Java water shield, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that are often submerged. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Ottelia alismoides var. javanica plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
