    "intro": "Oncidium cryptocopis, commonly known as the cryptic orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of fragrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in environments with seasonal dry periods. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil, and they absorb moisture from the air. Oncidium cryptocopis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
