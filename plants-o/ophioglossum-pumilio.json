    "intro": "Ophioglossum pumilio, commonly known as the small adder's-tongue, is a unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its small, spore-bearing leaves and a distinctive, tongue-shaped sporophyll that resembles an adder's tongue. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the sporophylls producing spores in a unique arrangement. Ophioglossum pumilio is also notable for its ancient lineage, being one of the oldest groups of vascular plants."
