    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petalled bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
