    "intro": "Oxalis amara var. monanthos, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage and flowers are often used in ornamental gardening for their delicate appearance. However, the plant contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
