It features narrow, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface or extend underwater. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Ophelia cordata is often used in water gardens and wetland restoration projects due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
