    "intro": "Oreocarya confertiflora, commonly known as the denseflower oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense inflorescences. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are often narrow and leathery, adapted to the harsh, cold conditions of its mountainous habitat. Oreocarya confertiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
