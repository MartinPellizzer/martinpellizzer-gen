    "intro": "Oxyspora howellii, commonly known as Howell's oxyspora, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecosystem health."
