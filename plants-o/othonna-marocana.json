    "intro": "Othonna marocana, commonly known as the Moroccan othonna, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of North Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna marocana is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry, sunny conditions."
