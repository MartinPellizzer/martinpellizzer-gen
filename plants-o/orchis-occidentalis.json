    "intro": "Orchis occidentalis, commonly known as the western orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. The western orchid is an important component of its ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
