    "intro": "Ophrys imbricata, commonly known as the veined helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and damp meadows. Its flowers have a distinctive veined structure and emit a mild fragrance to attract pollinators. Ophrys imbricata is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found growing in association with other orchid species."
