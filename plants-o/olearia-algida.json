    "intro": "Olearia algida, commonly known as the alpine daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-green foliage and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. It has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Olearia algida is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
