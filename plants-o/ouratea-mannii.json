    "intro": "Ouratea mannii, commonly known as the white-leaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually white or pale green in color, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
