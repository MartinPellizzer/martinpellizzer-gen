    "intro": "Opuntia deltica, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that is typically red or purple. Opuntia deltica is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals."
