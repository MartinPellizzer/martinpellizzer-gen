    "intro": "Oldenlandia incana, commonly known as the silverleaf false musk vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a trailing or climbing herb characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, silver-gray hairs that give the plant its common name. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests."
