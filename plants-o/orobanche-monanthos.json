    "intro": "Orobanche monanthos, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellow or reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops, making it a concern for farmers."
