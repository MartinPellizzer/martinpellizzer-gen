    "intro": "Ornithogalum pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, glaucous leaves covered in a waxy, sticky substance. The plant produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers with six petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence is surrounded by modified leaves called bracts, which are also sticky. Ornithogalum pruinosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils in full sun."
