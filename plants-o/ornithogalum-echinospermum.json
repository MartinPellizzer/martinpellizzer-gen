It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of white or pale blue star-shaped flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its spiny, spherical seed capsules, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum echinospermum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
