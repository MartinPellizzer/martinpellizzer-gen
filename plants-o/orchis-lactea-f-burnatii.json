    "intro": "Orchis lactea f. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's milk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale yellow to cream-colored flowers, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It has a pseudobulbous structure with long, narrow leaves, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered in many areas."
