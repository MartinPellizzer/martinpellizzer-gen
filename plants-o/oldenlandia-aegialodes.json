    "intro": "Oldenlandia aegialodes, commonly known as beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Oldenlandia aegialodes plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
