    "intro": "Ophiuros pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sea whip, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the class Anthozoa. It is characterized by its soft, branching structure covered in fine, hairy filaments, which give it its common name. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to hard substrates such as rocks or coral. The plant-like structure of Ophiuros pubescens is composed of a central axis with numerous polyps extending from it, each capable of capturing prey. Its presence contributes to the biodiversity and ecological balance of marine environments."
