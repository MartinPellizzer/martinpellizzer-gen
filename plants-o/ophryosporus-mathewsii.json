    "intro": "Ophryosporus mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' ghost flower, is a unique member of the family Apiaceae, characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence. This plant is native to the arid regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive, almost translucent appearance that gives it its common name. The plant is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often appearing only after rainfall in dry seasons. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ophryosporus mathewsii is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
