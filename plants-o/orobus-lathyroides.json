    "intro": "Orobus lathyroides, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant produces pod-like fruits containing edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal. Orobus lathyroides plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
