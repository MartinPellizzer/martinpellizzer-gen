    "intro": "Oscularia alba, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Oscularia alba is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
