    "intro": "Oreodaphne colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian daphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
