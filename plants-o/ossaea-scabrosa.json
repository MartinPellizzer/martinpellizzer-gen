    "intro": "Ossaea scabrosa, commonly known as the rough ossaea, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in umbels. Native to southern Africa, this plant thrives in rocky and arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Ossaea scabrosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
