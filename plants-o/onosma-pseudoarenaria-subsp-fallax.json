    "intro": "Onosma pseudoarenaria subsp. fallax, commonly known as the Armenian sandthrift, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, often covered in fine pubescence to reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes."
