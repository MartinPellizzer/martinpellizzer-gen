    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis subsp. marzuola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
