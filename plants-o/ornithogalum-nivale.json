    "intro": "Ornithogalum nivale, commonly known as the snowflake lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, blooming in late winter or early spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum nivale is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
