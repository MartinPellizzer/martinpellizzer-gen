It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and intense sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Oxydectes torreyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in desert ecosystems."
