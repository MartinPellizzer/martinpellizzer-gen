    "intro": "Otolepis cordigera, commonly known as the heart-leaved rock fig, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
