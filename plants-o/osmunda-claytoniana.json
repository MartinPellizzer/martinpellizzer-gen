    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana, commonly known as the royal fern, is a tall, robust fern native to North America. It features a tall, unbranched, sterile stalk that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has large, feather-like fronds with a distinctive, smooth, dark green surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
