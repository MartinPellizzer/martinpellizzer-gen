    "intro": "Olmedia maxima, commonly known as the giant olmedia, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, Olmedia maxima is valued both for ornamental purposes and as a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
