    "intro": "Orobanche sanguinea var. crinita, commonly known as the red broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes crops like beans and legumes. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield loss in crops, making it a concern for farmers."
