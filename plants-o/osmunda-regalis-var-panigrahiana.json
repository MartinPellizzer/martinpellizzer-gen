    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. panigrahiana, commonly known as the Panigrahiana Royal Fern, is a variant of the royal fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as swampy forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in compact clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also significant in traditional medicine in its native regions."
