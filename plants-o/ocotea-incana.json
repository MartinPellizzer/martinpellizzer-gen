It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, avocados, and cinnamon. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are small and white, typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, dark blue berries. Ocotea incana is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
