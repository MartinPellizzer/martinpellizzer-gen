    "intro": "Oxytropis tragacanthoides var. curaica, commonly known as Curaica goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody pod, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in arid conditions."
