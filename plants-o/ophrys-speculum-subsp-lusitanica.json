    "intro": "Ophrys speculum subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian mirror orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of an insect, typically a bee, to attract pollinators through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, often featuring intricate patterns and a distinctive \"eyelid\" structure. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
