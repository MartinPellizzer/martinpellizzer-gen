    "intro": "Orobanche teucrii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus. Its flowers are usually small and tubular, with a distinctive two-lipped structure. Orobanche teucrii is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
