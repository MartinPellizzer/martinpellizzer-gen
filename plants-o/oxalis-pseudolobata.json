It features heart-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Oxalis pseudolobata is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, making it a characteristic species of arid and semi-arid regions."
