    "intro": "Orbeanthus conjunctus, commonly known as the clustered orbeanthus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with silver-green foliage that reflects sunlight to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing small yellow to orange composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Orbeanthus conjunctus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
