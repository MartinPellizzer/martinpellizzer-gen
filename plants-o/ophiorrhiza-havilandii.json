    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's mangrove, is a rare and specialized plant that thrives in coastal and brackish water environments. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique adaptations to saline conditions. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It is often found in mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
