    "intro": "Opuntia dillei, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits called tunas, which are rich in nutrients. Opuntia dillei is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional cultures."
