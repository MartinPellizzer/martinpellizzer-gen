    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. salisii, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can impact the growth of its host species."
