    "intro": "Ochna fryeri, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ochna fryeri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
