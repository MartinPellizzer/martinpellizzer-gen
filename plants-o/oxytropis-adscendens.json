    "intro": "Oxytropis adscendens, commonly known as the ascending locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis adscendens is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
