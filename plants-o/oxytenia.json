    "intro": "Oxytenia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Bignoniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The leaves are typically opposite, simple, and have a rough texture. Oxytenia species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems and the ability to store water."
