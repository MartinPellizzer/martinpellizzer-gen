It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has lanceolate, often hairy leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish, with a short, narrow spur that is shorter than the standard in the typical form.
