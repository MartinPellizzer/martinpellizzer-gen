    "intro": "Ochrocarpos parvulus, commonly known as the small-flowered ochrocarpus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are usually hairy in texture. Its flowers are pale yellow to brownish, with tubular shapes that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
