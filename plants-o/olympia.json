    "intro": "Olympia, commonly known as the Olympic Peninsula's native flora, refers to a region rather than a specific plant. However, it is home to diverse botanical species, including the Olympic Peninsula's endemic plants like the Olympic sunflower (Helianthus olympicus). These plants have adapted to the moist, temperate climate and rugged terrain of the area. The region's unique ecological conditions support a variety of ferns, mosses, and coniferous trees. Botanists study these plants to understand the biodiversity and ecological significance of the Olympic Peninsula."
