    "intro": "Opuntia tilcarensis, commonly known as the Tilcarensis prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments called cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia tilcarensis is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, succulent stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
