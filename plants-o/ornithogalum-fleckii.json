It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often grown as an ornamental in gardens for its delicate appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Ornithogalum fleckii is also valued for its ability to thrive in coastal climates and its resistance to pests and diseases."
