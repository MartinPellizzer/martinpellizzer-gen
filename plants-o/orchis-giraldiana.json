    "intro": "Orchis giraldiana, commonly known as the Giraldian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a tall, erect flowering stem with a single, spurred flower that is usually violet or purple in color. Orchis giraldiana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
