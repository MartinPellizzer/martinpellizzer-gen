    "intro": "Onopordum viride, commonly known as the green thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features upright, sparsely branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive prickly texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, greenish-brown seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas. Onopordum viride is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
