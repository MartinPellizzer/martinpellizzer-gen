It is characterized by its smooth, glossy surface and typically exhibits a dark coloration, ranging from black to deep gray. Onyx is often used in jewelry and ornamental objects due to its durability and striking appearance. It forms in sedimentary rock and is found in various locations around the world, including Brazil and India. The mineral's name is derived from the Greek word \"onyx,\" meaning nail, referring to its smooth, polished texture."
