    "intro": "Ophrys apifera f. flavescens, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female honey bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
