    "intro": "Odontites viscosus subsp. asturicus, commonly known as the Asturian sticky bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its sticky leaves and stems are adaptations to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. It is a member of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae) and is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
