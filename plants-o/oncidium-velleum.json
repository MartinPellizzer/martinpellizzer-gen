    "intro": "Oncidium velleum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and sepals, which often have a slight greenish or reddish tinge. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant flowers that bloom sequentially. Oncidium velleum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light and well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical gardens due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
