    "intro": "Otophora siamensis, commonly known as the Siam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few elongated, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pale green or white with a faintly colored lip. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
