Native to South America, particularly Brazil, this plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Orleanesia typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves and clustered inflorescences. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
