    "intro": "Oenothera auricula subvar. williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger and more elongated petals compared to the typical form of Oenothera auricula."
