    "intro": "Oryctanthus neurophyllus, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense, leathery foliage that helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Oryctanthus neurophyllus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
