    "intro": "Onoclea variabilis, commonly known as the variable water cloak, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to triangular fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sori, which are clusters of sporangia, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. The species is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name."
