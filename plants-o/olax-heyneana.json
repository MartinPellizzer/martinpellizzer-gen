It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Olax heyneana is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
