    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
