It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are often pale blue or purple, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Odontocline glabra is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
