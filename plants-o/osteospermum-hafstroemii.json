It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flower heads that resemble oat clusters. The plant features hairy, gray-green leaves and produces showy, daisy-like blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

Osteospermum hafstroemii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
