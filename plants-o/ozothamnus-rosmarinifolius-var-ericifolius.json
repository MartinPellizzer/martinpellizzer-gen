    "intro": "Ozothamnus rosmarinifolius var. ericifolius, commonly known as the Ericifolius variety of the Narrowleaf Ironweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, foliage that is often covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-green appearance due to their pubescent surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
