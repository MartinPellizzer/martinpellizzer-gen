    "intro": "Ochna pyrifolia, commonly known as the firethorn, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped fruits that persist through winter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, followed by the distinctive orange-red berries. Ochna pyrifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though its berries are toxic to humans and livestock."
