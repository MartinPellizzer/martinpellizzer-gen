    "intro": "Orbicularia foveolata, commonly known as the horned Venus, is a unique succulent native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its globular shape and distinctive, spiky projections that resemble horns or spines. The plant's leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Due to its striking appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
