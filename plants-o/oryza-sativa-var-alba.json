    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. alba, commonly known as white rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its pale, almost white grains. It is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is native to Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, slender leaves and a panicle-like inflorescence. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with each spikelet containing three glumes and two stamens. The grains are enclosed in a hull, which is removed during processing to produce the polished rice commonly used in global cuisines."
