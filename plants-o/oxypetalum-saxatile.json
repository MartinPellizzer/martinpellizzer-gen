    "intro": "Oxypetalum saxatile, commonly known as the rock rose or saxatile rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Oxypetalum saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
