    "intro": "Odontochilus poilanei, commonly known as the Poliane's toothed orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on its leaf margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its small, delicate flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that enhance its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
