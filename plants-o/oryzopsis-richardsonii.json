    "intro": "Oryzopsis richardsonii, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Oryzopsis richardsonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
