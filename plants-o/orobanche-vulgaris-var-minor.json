    "intro": "Orobanche vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species such as legumes. The plant produces small, often yellow or brown flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
