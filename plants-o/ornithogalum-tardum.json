    "intro": "Ornithogalum tardum, commonly known as the late bell-plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped white or greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ornithogalum tardum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
