    "intro": "Oryzopsis swallenii, commonly known as the Swallen's grass, is a species of grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Oryzopsis swallenii is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
