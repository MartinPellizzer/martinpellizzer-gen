    "intro": "Oxalis purpurea, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of clover, and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis purpurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
