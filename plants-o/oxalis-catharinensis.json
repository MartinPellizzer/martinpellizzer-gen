    "intro": "Oxalis catharinensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Oxalis catharinensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
