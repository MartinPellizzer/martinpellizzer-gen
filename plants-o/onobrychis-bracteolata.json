    "intro": "Onobrychis bracteolata, commonly known as the bracteolate goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
