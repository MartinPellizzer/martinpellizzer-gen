    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 recchiae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly in regions like Italy and Greece. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy floral spike that resembles a wasp or bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This orchid thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
