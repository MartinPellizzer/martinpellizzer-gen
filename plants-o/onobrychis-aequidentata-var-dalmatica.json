    "intro": "Onobrychis aequidentata var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along rocky slopes. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage production."
