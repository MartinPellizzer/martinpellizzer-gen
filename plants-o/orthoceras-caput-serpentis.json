    "intro": "Orthoceras caput-serpentis, commonly known as the serpent's head, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Orthoceratopsidaceae. It is characterized by its unique spiral-shaped stem that resembles the shell of a prehistoric cephalopod. The plant's leaves are narrow and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
