    "intro": "Oreotrys bracteata, commonly known as the bracted oreotrys, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps it thrive in high-altitude environments. Oreotrys bracteata is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
