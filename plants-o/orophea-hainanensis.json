    "intro": "Orophea hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan torch tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Bombacaceae and is characterized by its striking, fiery orange-red inflorescences that resemble torches. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Orophea hainanensis thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions."
