    "intro": "Onobrychis meshhedensis, commonly known as Meshedan clover, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Iran. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is often found in rocky and semi-arid habitats, contributing to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature, it is of interest for ecological restoration projects in similar environments."
