    "intro": "Ononis viscosa proles longearistata, commonly known as the long-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, fleshy leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in xerophytic habitats."
