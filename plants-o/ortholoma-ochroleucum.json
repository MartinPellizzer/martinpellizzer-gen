    "intro": "Ortholoma ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert regions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ortholoma ochroleucum is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
