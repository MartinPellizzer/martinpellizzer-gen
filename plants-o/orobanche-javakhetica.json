    "intro": "Orobanche javakhetica, commonly known as the Caucasian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. It is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Due to its specialized biology, it plays a role in ecological interactions but is also considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
