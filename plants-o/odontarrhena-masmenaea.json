    "intro": "Odontarrhena masmenaea, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
