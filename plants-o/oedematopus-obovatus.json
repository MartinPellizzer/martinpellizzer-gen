    "intro": "Oedematopus obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, wheel-like inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Oedematopus obovatus is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in riverine areas and grasslands."
