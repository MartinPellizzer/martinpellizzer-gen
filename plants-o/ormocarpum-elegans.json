    "intro": "Ormocarpum elegans, commonly known as the elegant ormospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its fruit, known as a schizocarp, splits into two parts when mature, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Ormocarpum elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
