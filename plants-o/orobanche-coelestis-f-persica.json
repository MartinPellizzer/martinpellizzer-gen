    "intro": "Orobanche coelestis f. persica, commonly known as the Persian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem supporting its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and are pollinated by insects, though it does not produce seeds in cultivation. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
