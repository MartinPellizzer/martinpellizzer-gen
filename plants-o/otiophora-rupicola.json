    "intro": "Otiophora rupicola, commonly known as the rock wallaby orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in low-nutrient, dry soils. Otiophora rupicola is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in association with limestone or sandstone formations."
