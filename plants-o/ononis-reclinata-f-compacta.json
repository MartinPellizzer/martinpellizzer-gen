    "intro": "Ononis reclinata f. compacta, commonly known as the compact honeysuckle, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion."
