    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar wallflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor in crevices and loose soil. This subspecies is particularly adapted to saline and limestone soils, making it a characteristic species of coastal and cliff environments."
