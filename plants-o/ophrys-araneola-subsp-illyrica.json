    "intro": "Ophrys araneola subsp. illyrica, commonly known as the Ilyrian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates with moderate moisture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow hue with intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
