    "intro": "Ononis procurrens subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its small, oval leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and the stems are often prostrate or creeping. Sea thrift plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for pollinators."
