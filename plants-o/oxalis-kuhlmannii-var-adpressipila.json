It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, often adorned with reddish veins. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long blooming period."
