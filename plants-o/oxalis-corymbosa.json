    "intro": "Oxalis corymbosa, commonly known as the coral root oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and rockeries."
