It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats. Onobrychis bungei is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
