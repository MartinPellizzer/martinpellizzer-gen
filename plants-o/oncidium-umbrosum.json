    "intro": "Oncidium umbrosum, commonly known as the dark orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendant, spike-like inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, providing structural support for the flowering spikes. Oncidium umbrosum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
