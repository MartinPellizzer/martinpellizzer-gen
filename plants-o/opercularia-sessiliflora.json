    "intro": "Opercularia sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered opercularia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which adheres tightly to the substrate, typically found on rocks or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which provides nutrients through photosynthesis. Its morphology includes a dark, leathery surface with distinct, rounded lobes and a central areola. Opercularia sessiliflora is often used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
