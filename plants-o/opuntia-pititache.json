    "intro": "Opuntia pititache, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia pititache is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments."
