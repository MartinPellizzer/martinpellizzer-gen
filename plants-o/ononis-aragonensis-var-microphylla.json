    "intro": "Ononis aragonensis var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is adapted to rocky and limestone soils, making it a common sight in mountainous regions of Spain."
