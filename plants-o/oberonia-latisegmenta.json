    "intro": "Oberonia latisegmenta, commonly known as the broad-segmented orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered inflorescences that bear delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is noted for its unique floral structure, which includes prominently displayed, spurred petals."
