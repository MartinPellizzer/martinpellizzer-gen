    "intro": "Oberonia chandrasekharanii, commonly known as the Chandrasekharan's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that bears numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species requiring conservation efforts."
