    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 coloradensis, commonly known as the Colorado prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes. These stems are covered in small, spiny areoles, which bear both flowers and later, edible fruits. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and the fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in traditional cuisine."
