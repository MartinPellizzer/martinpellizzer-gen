    "intro": "Opuntia jussieui, commonly known as the Jussieui prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems known as cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia jussieui is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having spines for protection. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
