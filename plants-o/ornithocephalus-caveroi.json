It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in rocky or loose soil. Ornithocephalus caveroi is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution."
