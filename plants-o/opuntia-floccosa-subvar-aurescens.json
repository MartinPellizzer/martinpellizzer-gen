    "intro": "Opuntia floccosa subvar. aurescens, commonly known as the golden opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are covered in clusters of fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny, segmented stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
