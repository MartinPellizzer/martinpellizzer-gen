    "intro": "Orobanche noeana, commonly known as the Mediterranean dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Its flowers are small and usually appear in clusters, with a distinctive bilabiate structure. Orobanche noeana is native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in dry, disturbed soils."
