    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 vicina nothosubsp. corriasiana, commonly known as the Corriasian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its specialized floral morphology, including a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific regions of the Mediterranean, particularly in Italy and Greece. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green hues, contributing to its deceptive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and hybrid origin, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within the Orchidaceae family."
