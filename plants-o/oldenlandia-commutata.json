    "intro": "Oldenlandia commutata, commonly known as the common spiderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale purple flowers are clustered in loose racemes and bloom throughout the growing season. Oldenlandia commutata is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed in certain environments."
