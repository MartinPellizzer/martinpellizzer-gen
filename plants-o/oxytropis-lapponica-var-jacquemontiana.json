    "intro": "Oxytropis lapponica var. jacquemontiana, commonly known as the Lapland milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
