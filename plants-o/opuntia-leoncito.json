    "intro": "Opuntia leoncito, commonly known as the golden barrel cactus, is a species native to the dry regions of Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its spherical, ribbed stem that is covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it highly adapted to arid environments. Opuntia leoncito is also noted for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
