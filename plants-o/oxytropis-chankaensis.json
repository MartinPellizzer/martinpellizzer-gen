    "intro": "Oxytropis chankaensis, commonly known as Chanka's locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Oxytropis chankaensis is also noted for its potential ecological importance in stabilizing soil in high-altitude regions."
