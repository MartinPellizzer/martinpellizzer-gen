It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its foliage is aromatic and has been historically used by M\u0101ori for medicinal purposes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
