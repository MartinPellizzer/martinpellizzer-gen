    "intro": "Orchis radiata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single spike of flowers, often with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in woodland soils.
