    "intro": "Ornithogalum oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its potential toxicity to livestock."
