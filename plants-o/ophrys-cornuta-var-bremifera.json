    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. bremifera, commonly known as the Bremifera bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
