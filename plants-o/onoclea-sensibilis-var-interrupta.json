It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive interrupted pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, contributing to the aquatic ecosystem's biodiversity. The plant plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
