It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for garden planting."
