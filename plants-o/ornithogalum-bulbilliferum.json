    "intro": "Ornithogalum bulbilliferum, commonly known as the bulbous star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. The plant's unique reproductive strategy involves the formation of bulbils along the flower stalks, which can develop into new plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
