    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
