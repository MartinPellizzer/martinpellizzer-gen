    "intro": "Ophrys olonae, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys olonae is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
