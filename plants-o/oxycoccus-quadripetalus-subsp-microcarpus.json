    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus subsp. microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf cranberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It produces tiny, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor, similar to true cranberries. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and tundra environments. Its leaves are needle-like and remain green throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen nature. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to survive in extreme cold conditions."
