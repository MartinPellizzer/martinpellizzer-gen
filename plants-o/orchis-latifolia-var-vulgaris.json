    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and pairs of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale yellow to brownish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
