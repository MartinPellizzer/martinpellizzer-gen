    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sanconoensis subsp. vilmeri, commonly known as the Sanconensis Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that feature intricate patterns resembling female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its floral structure includes a labellum that is highly specialized for attracting pollinators. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique hybrid origins and ecological adaptations."
