    "intro": "Ononis repens var. inermis, commonly known as the soft sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, pale green or blue-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in dry environments."
