    "intro": "Ornithocephalus aurorae, commonly known as the Dawn's Head, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft blue glow during twilight hours. The plant possesses a unique floral structure with elongated, tubular petals that resemble the beak of a bird, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in the arid mountain environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Ornithocephalus aurorae is considered a conservation priority."
