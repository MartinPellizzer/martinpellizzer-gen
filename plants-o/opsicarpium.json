It consists of several species, most of which are native to the eastern United States. The plants are herbaceous perennials with basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped or ovate. They produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, often blooming in early spring. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds when mature."
