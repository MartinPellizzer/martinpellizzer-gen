    "intro": "Ochradenus baccatus var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid desert spurge, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and small, thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its capsules contain numerous small, spherical seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ochradenus baccatus var. rigidus is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
