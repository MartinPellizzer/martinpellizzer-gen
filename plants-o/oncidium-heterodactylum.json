    "intro": "Oncidium heterodactylum, commonly known as the rainbow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish pubescence. The plant produces intricate, fragrant inflorescences with brightly colored flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, arranged in a spiral pattern. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium heterodactylum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
