    "intro": "Opuntia intricata, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, known as cladodes, which are typically green and covered in fine spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia intricata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
