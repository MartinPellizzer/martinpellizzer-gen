    "intro": "Ononis monophylla var. tuna, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual with small, narrow leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy soils. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed or arid landscapes."
