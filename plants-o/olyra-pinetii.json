    "intro": "Olyra pinetii, commonly known as the African star grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, dark green blades that often have a slight blue tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Olyra pinetii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy choice for drought-resistant landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
