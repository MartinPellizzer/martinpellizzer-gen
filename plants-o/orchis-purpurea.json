    "intro": "Orchis purpurea, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers arranged in a spike, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often larger and more prominent. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. Orchis purpurea thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
