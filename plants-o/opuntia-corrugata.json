    "intro": "Opuntia corrugata, commonly known as the corrugated prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into flat, fleshy stems called cladodes, which store water and perform photosynthesis. Opuntia corrugata is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
