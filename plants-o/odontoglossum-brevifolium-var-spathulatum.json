    "intro": "Odontoglossum brevifolium var. spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant features lanceolate to spatulate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific climate requirements."
