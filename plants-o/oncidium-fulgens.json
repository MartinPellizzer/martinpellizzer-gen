    "intro": "Oncidium fulgens, commonly known as the fiery torch orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, orange-red flowers that resemble torches, often with contrasting yellow and green markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Oncidium fulgens requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
