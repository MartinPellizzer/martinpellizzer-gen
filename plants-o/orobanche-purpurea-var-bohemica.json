    "intro": "Orobanche purpurea var. bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish flowers. This species typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its life cycle involves germinating in the presence of host roots and forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems where it interacts with various host plants."
