    "intro": "Oxystophyllum deliense, commonly known as the Deli oxystophyllum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known genera such as Eucalyptus and Syzygium. The plant is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
