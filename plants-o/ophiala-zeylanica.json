It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Ophiala zeylanica is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist soil.
