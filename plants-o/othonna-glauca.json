    "intro": "Othonna glauca, commonly known as the silver cotula, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically from spring to summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Othonna glauca is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
