    "intro": "Omiltemia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed omiltemia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Omiltemia longipes is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
