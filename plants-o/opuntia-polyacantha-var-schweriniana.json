    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha var. schweriniana, commonly known as the Schwerin giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also notable for its long, sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores."
