    "intro": "Opuntia texana, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia texana is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
