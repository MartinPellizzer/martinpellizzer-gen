    "intro": "Orobanche stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found in disturbed soils, such as those in agricultural fields or along roadsides. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as those in the Fabaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
