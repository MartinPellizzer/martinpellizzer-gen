    "intro": "Ottonia douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's ottonia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ottonia douglasii is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in temperate regions."
