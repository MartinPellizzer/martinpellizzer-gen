    "intro": "Opuntia moelleri, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, slightly tart flavor. Opuntia moelleri is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
