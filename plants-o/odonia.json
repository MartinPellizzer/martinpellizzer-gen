    "intro": "Odonia, commonly known as the \"water lily,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nympheaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Odonia species typically have thick, waxy leaves that provide buoyancy and support for their flowers. Their roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, while their stems are submerged. The flowers of Odonia are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
