    "intro": "Orchis tephrosanthos var. militaris, commonly known as the military orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers with a contrasting yellowish-green lip, which plays a crucial role in attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological interdependence. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as endangered in several areas."
