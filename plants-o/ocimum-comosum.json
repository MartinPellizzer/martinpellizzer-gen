    "intro": "Ocimum comosum, commonly known as wild basil, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are pubescent on the underside. Its flowers are small, tubular, and clustered in spikes, producing nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ocimum comosum is also valued for its essential oils, which contain compounds such as linalool and eugenol."
