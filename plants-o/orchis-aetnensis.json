    "intro": "Orchis aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to the volcanic soil and harsh climatic conditions of the region. It has specialized root structures that help it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
