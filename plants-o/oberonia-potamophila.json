    "intro": "Oberonia potamophila, commonly known as the river orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, elongated pseudobulbs and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of dense forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain rather than from soil. Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia potamophila is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
