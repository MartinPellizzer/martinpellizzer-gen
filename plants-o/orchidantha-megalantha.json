    "intro": "Orchidantha megalantha, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as purple, pink, and white. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. The orchid's intricate floral structure includes multiple petals and a specialized lip that plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
