    "intro": "Ormilis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or elliptic, often with a waxy coating. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or reddish in color, blooming in early spring. Ormilis species are often found in woodland habitats and are characterized by their distinctive, often toxic sap."
