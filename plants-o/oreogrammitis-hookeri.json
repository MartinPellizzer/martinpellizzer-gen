    "intro": "Oreogrammitis hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Oreogrammitis hookeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
