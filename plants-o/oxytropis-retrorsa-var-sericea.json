    "intro": "Oxytropis retrorsa var. sericea, commonly known as the silky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green stems and trifoliate leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
