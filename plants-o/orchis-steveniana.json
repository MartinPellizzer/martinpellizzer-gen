    "intro": "Orchis steveniana, commonly known as the Steven's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or meadow habitats. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Orchis steveniana is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
