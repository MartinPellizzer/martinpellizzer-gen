    "intro": "Oxydenia virgata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dense canopy. The leaves are alternate, simple, and have a silvery-white underside, giving the tree its common name. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spherical fruits. Oxydenia virgata is often found in coastal forests and is valued for its timber and ornamental qualities."
