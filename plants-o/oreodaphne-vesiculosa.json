    "intro": "Oreodaphne vesiculosa, commonly known as the bubbleleaf tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicle inflorescences, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are known for their unique, translucent bubbles or vesicles, which give the plant its common name. Oreodaphne vesiculosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
