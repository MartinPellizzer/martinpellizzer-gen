    "intro": "Ostrowskia, commonly known as the frostweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the northern regions of the Americas, particularly Canada and the northern United States. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Ostrowskia species are typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. They are known for their ability to tolerate cold climates and are often among the first plants to bloom in early spring."
