    "intro": "Ochna ciliata, commonly known as the silky ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are softly hairy on the underside, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ochna ciliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
