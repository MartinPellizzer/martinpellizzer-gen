    "intro": "Ornithogalum tortile, commonly known as the twisted lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and produces a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant bears umbel-like clusters of white or pale green flowers with six tepals, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. Ornithogalum tortile is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas."
