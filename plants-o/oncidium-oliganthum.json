    "intro": "Oncidium oliganthum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrates. Oncidium oliganthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
