    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. hesperia, commonly known as the European sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry, open habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local insect populations."
