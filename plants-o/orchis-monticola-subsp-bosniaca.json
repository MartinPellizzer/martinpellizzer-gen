    "intro": "Orchis monticola subsp. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian Heath Orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being showy and spurred. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other orchid species in the monticola complex."
