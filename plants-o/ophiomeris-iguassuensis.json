    "intro": "Ophiomeris iguassuensis, commonly known as the Iguassu spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its production of cyathia, which are specialized inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are inconspicuous and clustered in cyathia. Ophiomeris iguassuensis is adapted to humid, shaded environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
