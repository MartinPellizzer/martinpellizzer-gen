    "intro": "Oleaster, commonly known as the European hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It belongs to the genus Crataegus in the rose family, Rosaceae, and is characterized by its thorny branches and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits called pomes, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Oleaster is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil in temperate climates."
