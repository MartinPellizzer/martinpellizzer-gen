    "intro": "Overstratia, commonly known as the \"tree of life,\" is a unique plant species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its roots system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. Overstratia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
