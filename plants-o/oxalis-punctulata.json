    "intro": "Oxalis punctulata, commonly known as the spotted wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white spots and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Oxalis punctulata is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
