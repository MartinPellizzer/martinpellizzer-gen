It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing violet or purple flowers with intricate patterns. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between different orchid species, contributing to its genetic diversity.
