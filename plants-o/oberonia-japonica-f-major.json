    "intro": "Oberonia japonica f. major, commonly known as the giant Japanese orchid, is a unique variant of the species native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow with red veins, making it visually striking. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. This form is notable for its larger size compared to the typical form of Oberonia japonica, which contributes to its ornamental value in cultivation."
