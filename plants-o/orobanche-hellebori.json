    "intro": "Orobanche hellebori, commonly known as the greater broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant typically grows in association with host species such as Ranunculus and other members of the buttercup family. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
