    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum verrucosum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and may bear small, rounded protrusions. Ophthalmophyllum verrucosum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to low-light conditions."
