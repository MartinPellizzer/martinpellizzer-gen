    "intro": "Olearia elaeophila var. major, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its unique aesthetic. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
