    "intro": "Oxybaphus ovatus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Oxybaphus ovatus is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both a persistent weed and a subject of study in plant ecology and agronomy."
