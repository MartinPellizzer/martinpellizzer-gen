    "intro": "Oreosedum alsinifolium, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. Oreosedum alsinifolium is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species well-suited to coastal habitats."
