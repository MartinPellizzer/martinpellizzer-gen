    "intro": "Osmoxylon, commonly known as the \"sandalwood tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Burseraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. Osmoxylon species typically have smooth, gray bark and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are usually alternate and simple, with a leathery texture that helps the plant conserve water in arid environments."
