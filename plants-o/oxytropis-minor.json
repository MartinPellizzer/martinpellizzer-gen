It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis minor is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
