    "intro": "Orchis longicruris subsp. longipenis, commonly known as the long-penis orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated floral structure, which includes a long, slender column and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and green, with a unique shape that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
