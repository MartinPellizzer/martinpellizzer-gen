    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. omegaifera, commonly known as the omega orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its floral structure features a distinctive, elaborate lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
