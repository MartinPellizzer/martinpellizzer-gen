    "intro": "Orobus alatus, commonly known as the winged orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems covered with small, wing-like structures that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. Orobus alatus is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
