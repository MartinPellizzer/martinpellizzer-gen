    "intro": "Oxygonum lobatum, commonly known as the broadleaf waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Oxygonum lobatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and poor soil conditions."
