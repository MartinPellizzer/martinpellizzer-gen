    "intro": "Opilia strobilifera, commonly known as the redwood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Opilia strobilifera thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
