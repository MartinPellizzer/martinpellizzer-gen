It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
