It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
