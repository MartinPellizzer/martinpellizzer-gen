    "intro": "Opuntia macrocentra, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia macrocentra is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its succulent stems store water, making it highly drought-tolerant."
