    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 boscoquartensis, commonly known as the Boscoquartensis bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys lutea. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in regions of southern Europe, particularly in Italy and France. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it blooms during the spring months. This orchid is a testament to the complex evolutionary adaptations seen in the Ophrys genus."
