    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. crabronifera, commonly known as the Argolic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as rocky slopes and limestone areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
