    "intro": "Opuntia discata, commonly known as the flat prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia discata is a drought-tolerant plant with a shallow root system, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its structure and growth habits make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
