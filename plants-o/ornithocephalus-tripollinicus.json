    "intro": "Ornithocephalus tripollinicus, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique tri-lobed petals that resemble bird beaks, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
