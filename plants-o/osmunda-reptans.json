    "intro": "Osmunda reptans, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a complex rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a unique pattern. Osmunda reptans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
