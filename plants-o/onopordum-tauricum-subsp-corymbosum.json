    "intro": "Onopordum tauricum subsp. corymbosum, commonly known as the Crimean thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features a robust root system and produces spiny, lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant blooms with showy, yellow flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, forming a composite flower head. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in steppe and coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
