    "intro": "Ormocarpum oblongum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by distinctive, elongated fruits that are covered in a waxy coating. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and somewhat toxic member of the Apiaceae family. Ormocarpum oblongum is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
