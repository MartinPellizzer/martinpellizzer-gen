    "intro": "Odontostigma subacaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed toothed plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a unique, ornamental appearance. Odontostigma subacaule is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
