    "intro": "Opuntia salmiana, commonly known as the Spanish dagger, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a succulent structure, allowing it to store water efficiently in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into flat, fleshy stems, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia salmiana is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall."
