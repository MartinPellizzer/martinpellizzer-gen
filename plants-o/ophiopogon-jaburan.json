    "intro": "Ophiopogon jaburan, commonly known as the dwarf lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ophiopogon jaburan is also valued for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
