    "intro": "Obione depressa, commonly known as the dwarf obione, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically reaches a height of less than 10 centimeters, with a rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white or pale green, which appear in early spring. Its leaves are succulent and can store water, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Obione depressa is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
