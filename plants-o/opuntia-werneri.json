    "intro": "Opuntia werneri, commonly known as the Werneri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically spherical and covered in a fuzzy coating. Opuntia werneri is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native habitat."
