    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as slender sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and forage."
