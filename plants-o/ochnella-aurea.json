    "intro": "Ochnella aurea, commonly known as the golden ochna, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. The plant produces small, round, orange-red fruits that are edible and contain a single seed. Ochnella aurea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds."
