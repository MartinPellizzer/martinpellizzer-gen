    "intro": "Orchis majalis carnea, commonly known as the pink marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces a flowering stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is considered rare and is protected in several European countries due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
