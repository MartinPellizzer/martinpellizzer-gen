    "intro": "Oryzopsis pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bract-like structures that are often pubescent. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Oryzopsis pubiflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
