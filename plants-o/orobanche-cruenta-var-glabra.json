    "intro": "Orobanche cruenta var. glabra, commonly known as the naked stem broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous hosts such as vetches and clovers. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host and forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
