    "intro": "Ononis natrix f. fontanesiana, commonly known as the Fontanesian sandwort, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
