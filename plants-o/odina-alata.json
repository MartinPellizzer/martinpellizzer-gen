    "intro": "Odina alata, commonly known as the winged beggar's ticks, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal spikes. The plant produces small, dry fruits that release tiny seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides."
