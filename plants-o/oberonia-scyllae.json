    "intro": "Oberonia scyllae, commonly known as the Scylla orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a raceme of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. Oberonia scyllae is epiphytic in nature, often growing on tree trunks or branches in shaded environments. Its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
