    "intro": "Orchis palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and the plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Orchis palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and supporting biodiversity."
