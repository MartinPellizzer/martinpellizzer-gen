    "intro": "Orchis moriopapilionacea, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which resemble the face of a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three petals and three sepals, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Orchis moriopapilionacea is a rare and protected species, often found in fragmented habitats across southern Europe."
