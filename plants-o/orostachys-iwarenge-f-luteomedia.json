    "intro": "Orostachys iwarenge f. luteomedia, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, cushion-like growth habit with fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
