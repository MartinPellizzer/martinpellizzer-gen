    "intro": "Oxypetalum insigne var. insigne, commonly known as the noble oxypetalum, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are woody and somewhat succulent. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of particular interest to botanists and horticulturalists."
