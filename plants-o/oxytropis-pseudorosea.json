It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are small and often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis pseudorosea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
