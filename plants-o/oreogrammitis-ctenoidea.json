    "intro": "Oreogrammitis ctenoidea, commonly known as the hairy cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to anchor itself to vertical surfaces. Oreogrammitis ctenoidea is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and specialized member of its ecosystem."
