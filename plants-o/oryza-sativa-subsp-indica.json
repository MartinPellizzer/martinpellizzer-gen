    "intro": "Oryza sativa subsp. indica, commonly known as the indica rice, is a subspecies of rice native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stalks and long, narrow grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and produces panicles of small, white flowers. Indica rice is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and requires a warm, wet environment for optimal growth. Its genetic diversity contributes to the development of various rice varieties with different traits such as grain size, texture, and yield."
