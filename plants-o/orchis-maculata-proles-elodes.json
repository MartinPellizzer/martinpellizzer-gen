It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers with a distinctive dark spot on the lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodlands. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. The species is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
