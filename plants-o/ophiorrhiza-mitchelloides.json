It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Ophiorrhiza mitchelloides is typically found growing on the branches of host trees, relying on them for some of its nutrients."
