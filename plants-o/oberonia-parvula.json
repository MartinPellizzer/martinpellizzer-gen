    "intro": "Oberonia parvula, commonly known as the small orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, with a unique structure that includes a spurred lip. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Oberonia parvula is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
