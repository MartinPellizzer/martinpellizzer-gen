It is native to Southeast Asia and includes several species, such as Ochrolasia celtidifolia and Ochrolasia macrophylla. These plants are characterized by their striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. The leaves are typically large, simple, and alternate, with a glossy surface. Ochrolasia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
