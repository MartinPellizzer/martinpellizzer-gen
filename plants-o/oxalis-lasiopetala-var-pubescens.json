    "intro": "Oxalis lasiopetala var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal remedies, though it contains oxalic acid and should be handled with care. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid environments."
