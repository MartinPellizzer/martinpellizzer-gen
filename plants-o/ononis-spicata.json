    "intro": "Ononis spicata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough texture due to fine hairs."
