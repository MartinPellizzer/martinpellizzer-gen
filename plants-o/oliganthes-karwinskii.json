    "intro": "Oliganthes karwinskii, commonly known as the Karwinski's oliganthes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is aromatic, and it produces small, white to pale yellow blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oliganthes karwinskii is considered a species of conservation concern."
