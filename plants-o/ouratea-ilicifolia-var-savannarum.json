    "intro": "Ouratea ilicifolia var. savannarum, commonly known as the savanna ouratea, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release seeds. This variety is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as pine flatwoods and sandhill ecosystems."
