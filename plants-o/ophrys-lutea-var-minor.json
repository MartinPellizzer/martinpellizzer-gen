    "intro": "Ophrys lutea var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy yellow flower that has a distinctive lip. Its flowers are often pollinated by male bees through a mimicry mechanism that resembles a female bee. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
