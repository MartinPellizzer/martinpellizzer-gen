    "intro": "Ophrys kurdistanica, commonly known as the Kurdish bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Kurdistan. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
