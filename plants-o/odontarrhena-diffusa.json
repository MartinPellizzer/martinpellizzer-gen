    "intro": "Odontarrhena diffusa, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland and savanna habitats. Due to its fragrant wood, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of incense."
