    "intro": "Ortostachys, commonly known as the spiny grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their upright growth habit and often have sharp, spiny structures on their leaves or stems. Ortostachys species are native to various regions in Asia, particularly China and Japan, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. They typically produce small, clustered flowers that are often green or reddish in color. Due to their ornamental value and hardy nature, some species are cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
