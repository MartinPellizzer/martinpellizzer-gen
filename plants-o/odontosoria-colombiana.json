    "intro": "Odontosoria colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian tooth fern, is a tropical fern native to the humid forests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a serrated or tooth-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical collections."
