    "intro": "Oncinotis tomentella, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has a creeping growth habit with thin, branching stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Oncinotis tomentella is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family, known for its carnivorous tendencies."
