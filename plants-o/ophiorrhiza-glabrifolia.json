    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved mangrove, is a tropical shrub belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. This plant is often found in coastal areas, including mangrove swamps and estuaries, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. Its root system includes prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange. Ophiorrhiza glabrifolia plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
