    "intro": "Onobrychis stenostachya subsp. sosnowskyi, commonly known as Sosnowsky's vetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with oval leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
