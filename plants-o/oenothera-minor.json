It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oenothera minor is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and thrives in full sun. It is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its oil-rich seeds."
