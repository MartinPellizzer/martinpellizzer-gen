    "intro": "Opuntia perotensis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia perotensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various desert species."
