    "intro": "Oxycaryum guianense, commonly known as the Guianese wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the rainforests of northern South America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and a single, unbranched stem that can grow over 20 meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by fruit that contains a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
