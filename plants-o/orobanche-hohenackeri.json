    "intro": "Orobanche hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, allowing it to persist in suitable environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
