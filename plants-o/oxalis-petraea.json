    "intro": "Oxalis petraea, commonly known as the rock oxalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found growing in limestone areas and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Oxalis petraea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky gardens."
