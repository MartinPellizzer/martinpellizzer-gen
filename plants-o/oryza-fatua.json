    "intro": "Oryza fatua, commonly known as wild rice, is an annual grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soil, often found in fields, marshes, and along waterways. Its seeds are encased in a tough, husky covering, which aids in their dispersal and survival in various environments. Oryza fatua is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has also been cultivated for its nutritional value in some cultures."
