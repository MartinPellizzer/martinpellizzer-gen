    "intro": "Odostemon pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with a rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of the common dandelion. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
