    "intro": "Oxypetalum pannosum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the rare mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
