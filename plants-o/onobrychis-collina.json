    "intro": "Onobrychis collina, commonly known as lesser burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, spiny pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Onobrychis collina is valued for its forage quality and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
