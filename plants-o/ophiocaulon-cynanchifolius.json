    "intro": "Ophiocaulon cynanchifolius, commonly known as the scarlet gourd, is a member of the Cucurbitaceae family and is native to the southern United States. It is a climbing vine characterized by its bright orange to red fruits, which are typically 15\u201320 cm in length. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are hairy and often twining. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The fruits are edible when ripe but are generally too bitter for most culinary uses."
