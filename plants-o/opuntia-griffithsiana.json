    "intro": "Opuntia griffithsiana, commonly known as the Griffiths' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. Opuntia griffithsiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
