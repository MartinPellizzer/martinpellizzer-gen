    "intro": "Onobrychis trichocalycina, commonly known as the silky bursaria, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in bristly, pod-like structures that aid in wind dispersal. Onobrychis trichocalycina is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for erosion control."
