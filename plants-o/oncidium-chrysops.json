    "intro": "Oncidium chrysops, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, brightly colored flowers that typically feature a yellow or orange lip with contrasting patterns. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom in clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Oncidium chrysops prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, and it is relatively easy to care for in a home environment."
