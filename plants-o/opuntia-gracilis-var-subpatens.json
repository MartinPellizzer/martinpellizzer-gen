    "intro": "Opuntia gracilis var. subpatens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant's structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
