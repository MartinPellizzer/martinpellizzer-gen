    "intro": "Oxytropis rhizantha, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. The plant produces small, yellow to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. Oxytropis rhizantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
