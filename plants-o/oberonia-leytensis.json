    "intro": "Oberonia leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte Oberonia, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia leytensis is considered threatened, highlighting the need for its protection."
