    "intro": "Opuntia littoralis var. martiniana, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to coastal regions of Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its pads are edible and have been used traditionally for food and medicinal purposes. This variety is well-suited to arid and coastal environments due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance."
