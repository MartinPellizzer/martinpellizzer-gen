    "intro": "Opuntia fuliginosa, commonly known as the black prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, flattened stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia fuliginosa is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy pads. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
