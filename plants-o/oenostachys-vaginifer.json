    "intro": "Oenostachys vaginifer, commonly known as the false bamboo or velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hollow stems that often have a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, smooth, and often have a waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. Oenostachys vaginifer is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
