    "intro": "Oncidium bifolium var. majus, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, showy flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to retain moisture. The flowers, which can be yellow, orange, or red, are arranged in clusters and are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
