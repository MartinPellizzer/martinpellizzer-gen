    "intro": "Oxymeris sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf oxymeris, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
