    "intro": "Opuntia ellisiana, commonly known as the Ellisiana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, spine-tipped glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisines. Opuntia ellisiana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
