    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. andria, commonly known as the Andria bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration and intricate patterns. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
