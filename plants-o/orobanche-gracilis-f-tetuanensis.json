    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis f. tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan slender broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to regions of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in botanical studies and ecological research."
