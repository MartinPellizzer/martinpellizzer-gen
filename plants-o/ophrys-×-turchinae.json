It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys \u00d7 turchinae is a relatively rare and specialized species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
