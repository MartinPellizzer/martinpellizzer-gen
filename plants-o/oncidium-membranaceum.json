It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually light green and can grow up to several feet in length. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. Oncidium membranaceum is popular among orchid growers for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
