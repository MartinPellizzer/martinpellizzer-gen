    "intro": "Oberonia meegaskumburae, commonly known as the Sri Lankan orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish-brown markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to the humid, shaded environment of the understory. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia meegaskumburae is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
