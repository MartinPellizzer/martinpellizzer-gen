    "intro": "Oncidium vagans, commonly known as the wandering orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium vagans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
