    "intro": "Ortgiesia kertesziae, commonly known as the Kerteszia orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
