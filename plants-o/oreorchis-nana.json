    "intro": "Oreorchis nana, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that is usually white or pale green. The plant is characterized by its specialized orchid structure, including a labellum and column, which are typical of the Orchidaceae family. Oreorchis nana thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
