    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza cavaleriei, commonly known as the Malabar bedstraw, is a tropical shrub native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky areas. Ophiorrhiza cavaleriei is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in local ecosystems."
