    "intro": "Osmia sericea, commonly known as the silky bandicoot. This species is a solitary ground-nesting bee that plays an important role in pollination. It is native to various regions in Australia and is often found in habitats with flowering plants. The female constructs a burrow in the ground and provisions it with pollen and nectar from flowers. Its silky appearance, due to fine hairs, helps in reducing heat loss, adapting it to cooler climates."
