    "intro": "Ophiocaryon duckei, commonly known as the duckweed plant, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it stay afloat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually through vegetative propagation. Ophiocaryon duckei thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
