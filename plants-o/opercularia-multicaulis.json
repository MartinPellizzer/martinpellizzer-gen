    "intro": "Opercularia multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Teloschistaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with distinct, elongated, and often branched lobes. It produces bright orange to reddish apothecia that are surrounded by a distinctive opercularium, a structure that covers the spore-producing surface. This lichen is often found on limestone and sandstone substrates in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure."
