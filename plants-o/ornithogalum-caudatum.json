    "intro": "Ornithogalum caudatum, commonly known as the long-stalked star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attract specific pollinators. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Ornithogalum caudatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can be invasive in some regions."
