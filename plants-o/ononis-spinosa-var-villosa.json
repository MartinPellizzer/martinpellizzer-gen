    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. villosa, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features wiry, branched stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which give it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
