    "intro": "Onobrychis alba var. echinata, commonly known as the white clover variant with thorny pods, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use in livestock forage."
