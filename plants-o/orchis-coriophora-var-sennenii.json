    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. sennenii, commonly known as the Sennen's narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique floral structure with three sepals and three petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
