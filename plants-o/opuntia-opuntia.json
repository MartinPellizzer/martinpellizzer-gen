    "intro": "Opuntia opuntia, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, the prickly pear, is edible and has been used for food and traditional medicine. Opuntia opuntia is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions."
