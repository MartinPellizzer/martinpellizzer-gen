    "intro": "Orchis spitzelii subsp. cazorlensis, commonly known as the Cazorlen orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive violet to purple flowers with a yellowish-green lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring, and is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
