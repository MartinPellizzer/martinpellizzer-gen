    "intro": "Ophrys straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys straussii is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single or double ovary at the base."
