    "intro": "Oenothera multicaulis var. petiolaris, commonly known as the petioled evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, branching stems that often have a reddish tinge, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and usually have petioles, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Oenothera multicaulis var. petiolaris is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats like prairies and woodland edges."
