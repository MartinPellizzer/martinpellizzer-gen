    "intro": "Oryzopsis miliacea, commonly known as millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind pollination. Oryzopsis miliacea is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun. It has historical significance in traditional agriculture and is sometimes used as a forage crop for livestock."
