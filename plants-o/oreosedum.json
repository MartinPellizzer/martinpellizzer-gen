    "intro": "Oreosedum, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, often thick leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. They are typically found in rocky or arid environments, where they thrive in well-drained soil. Oreosedum species are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Many varieties are also used in ornamental gardening for their vibrant colors and compact growth habits."
