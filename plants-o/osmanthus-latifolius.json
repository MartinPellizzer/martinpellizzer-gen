    "intro": "Osmanthus latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a smooth, dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late autumn. These flowers are highly aromatic and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections. The fruit is a small, dark brown drupe that matures in the following spring."
