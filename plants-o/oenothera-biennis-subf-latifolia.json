    "intro": "Oenothera biennis subf. latifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-to-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical subspecies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. The seeds are enclosed in a hairy capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
