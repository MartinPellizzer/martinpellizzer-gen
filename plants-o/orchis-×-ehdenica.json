    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 ehdenica, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Orchis \u00d7 ehdenica is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
