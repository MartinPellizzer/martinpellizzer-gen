It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs, and its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Oocephalus argyrophyllus is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
