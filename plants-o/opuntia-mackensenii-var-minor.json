    "intro": "Opuntia mackensenii var. minor, commonly known as the lesser prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
