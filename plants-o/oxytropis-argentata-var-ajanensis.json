    "intro": "Oxytropis argentata var. ajanensis, commonly known as silver pea or silver locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
