    "intro": "Ophrys garganica, commonly known as the Garganica bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Italy and parts of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination by male wasps. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and rocky habitats, often in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys garganica is a perennial herb that produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower, making it a striking yet rare addition to the orchid family."
