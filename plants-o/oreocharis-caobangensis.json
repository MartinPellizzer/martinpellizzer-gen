    "intro": "Oreocharis caobangensis, commonly known as the Caobang oreocharis, is a rare flowering plant native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its unique and delicate floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive. Its flowers are usually small and have a distinctive coloration, which helps in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
