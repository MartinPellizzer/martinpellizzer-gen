    "intro": "Orchidantha stercorea, commonly known as the dung orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to certain regions of Australia. It is named for its unusual habit of growing in association with the dung of specific animals, particularly the bettong and bilby. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this rare species is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
