It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. Orchis odoratissima is often found in meadows, woodlands, and other moist, well-drained habitats."
