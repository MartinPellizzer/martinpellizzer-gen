    "intro": "Ophioglossum opacum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that emerge from a fleshy, underground rhizome. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in a unique, club-like arrangement. Ophioglossum opacum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
