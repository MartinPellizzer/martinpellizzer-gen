    "intro": "Orthaea fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orthaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Orthaea fimbriata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of temperate flora."
