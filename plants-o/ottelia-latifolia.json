    "intro": "Ottelia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf waterplantain, is a water-dwelling plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it has a fibrous root system adapted for aquatic environments. Ottelia latifolia is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. Its presence is an indicator of nutrient-rich, shallow water habitats."
