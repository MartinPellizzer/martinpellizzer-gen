It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture and a slightly aromatic scent. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by olive-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. The tree is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of the Chimanimani mountain range."
