    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. papjerwica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy spike of pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
