    "intro": "Orthaea, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a small, flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Orthaea is an annual or biennial herb that spreads through seeds and can form dense mats in suitable habitats. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions of Europe and Asia."
