    "intro": "Ouratea melinonii, commonly known as the white-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and ornamental purposes."
