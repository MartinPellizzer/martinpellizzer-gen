    "intro": "Oxytropis stracheyana, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis stracheyana is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem."
