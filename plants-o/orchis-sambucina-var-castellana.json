    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers with a yellowish lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often associated with specific microhabitats in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
