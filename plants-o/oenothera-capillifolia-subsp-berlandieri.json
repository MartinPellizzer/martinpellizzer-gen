    "intro": "Oenothera capillifolia subsp. berlandieri, commonly known as the plains evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Oenothera capillifolia."
