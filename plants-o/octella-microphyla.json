    "intro": "Octella microphyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
