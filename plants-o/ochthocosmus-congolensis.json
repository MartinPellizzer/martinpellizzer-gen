The tree's bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often marked with distinct lenticels. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns from green to yellow or orange when mature. Ochthocosmus congolensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
