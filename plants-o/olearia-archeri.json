    "intro": "Olearia archeri, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations. It has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Olearia archeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
