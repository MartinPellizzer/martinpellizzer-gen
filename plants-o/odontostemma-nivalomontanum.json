    "intro": "Odontostemma nivalomontanum, commonly known as the snow mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in cold climates. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to low temperatures and limited nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in loose, mountainous soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
