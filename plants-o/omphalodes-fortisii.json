    "intro": "Omphalodes fortisii, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Omphalodes fortisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
