    "intro": "Orbea wissmannii subsp. eremastrum, commonly known as the Eremastrum orbea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to drought conditions through its thick, water-storing stems. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
