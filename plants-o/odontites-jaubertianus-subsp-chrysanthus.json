    "intro": "Odontites jaubertianus subsp. chrysanthus, commonly known as the golden odontite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
