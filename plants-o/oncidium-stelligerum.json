    "intro": "Oncidium stelligerum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically yellow with red or orange markings, arranged in a raceme. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Oncidium stelligerum requires well-draining potting media and regular watering to flourish."
