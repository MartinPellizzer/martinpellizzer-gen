    "intro": "Oxalis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soil, often in high-altitude environments. Its foliage contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific growing conditions."
