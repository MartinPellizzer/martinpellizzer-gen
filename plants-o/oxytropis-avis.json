    "intro": "Oxytropis avis, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble a bird's foot, and its yellow or orange-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Oxytropis avis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
