    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, butterfly-like flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces numerous showy, spurred orchid flowers arranged in a raceme, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. This orchid is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
