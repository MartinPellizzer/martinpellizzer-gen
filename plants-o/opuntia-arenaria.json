    "intro": "Opuntia arenaria, commonly known as the sandhill prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Opuntia arenaria is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in sandy and rocky soils."
