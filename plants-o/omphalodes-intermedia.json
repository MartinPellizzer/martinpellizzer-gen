It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Omphalodes intermedia is adapted to dry, well-drained environments and is commonly seen in open habitats such as dunes and coastal areas."
