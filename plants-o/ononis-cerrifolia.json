It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.
