It features delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for shaded gardens.
