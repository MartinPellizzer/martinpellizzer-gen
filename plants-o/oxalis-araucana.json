    "intro": "Oxalis araucana, commonly known as the Araucana wood sorrel, is a striking perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a shamrock, often with a distinctive red or orange coloration. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis araucana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
