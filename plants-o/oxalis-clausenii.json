    "intro": "Oxalis clausenii, commonly known as the desert false shamrock, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers with five petals, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry environments."
