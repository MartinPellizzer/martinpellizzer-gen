    "intro": "Ocimum acrocephalum, commonly known as blue basil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually violet or blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Ocimum acrocephalum is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its fragrance and appearance make it a popular ornamental plant as well."
