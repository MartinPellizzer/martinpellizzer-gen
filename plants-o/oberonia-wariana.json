    "intro": "Oberonia wariana, commonly known as the Wariana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Oberonia wariana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
