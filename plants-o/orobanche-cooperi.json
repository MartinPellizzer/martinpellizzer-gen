    "intro": "Orobanche cooperi, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem and a cluster of flowers. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Orobanche cooperi is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but still depends on host plants for most of its nutritional needs. Its presence can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
