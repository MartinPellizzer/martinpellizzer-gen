    "intro": "Orthothecium viscidum, commonly known as the sticky cup lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark, almost black, upper surface that is often covered with a viscous, sticky substance. The lower surface of the lichen is typically white to pale yellow, with a granular texture and small, scattered pores. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions. This lichen is known for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
