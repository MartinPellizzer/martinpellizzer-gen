    "intro": "Oenothera strigulosa, commonly known as the prairie blazingstar, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in dry prairies and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Oenothera strigulosa plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly moths, due to its nocturnal flowering habit."
