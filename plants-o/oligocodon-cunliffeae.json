    "intro": "Oligocodon cunliffeae, commonly known as the Cunliffe's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, ghostly white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, fleshy leaves are adapted to store water in its native humid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under Australian conservation laws."
