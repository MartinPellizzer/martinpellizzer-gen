    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 normanii, commonly known as the Norman's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns that resemble female bees, a strategy to enhance pollination. It typically grows in grassland habitats and thrives in temperate climates. The hybrid nature of Ophrys \u00d7 normanii results from crosses between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, contributing to its unique floral characteristics."
