    "intro": "Omphalophthalma, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plants typically have dark green, waxy leaves that are often heart-shaped or arrowhead-shaped. Omphalophthalma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal, though some species contain toxic compounds."
