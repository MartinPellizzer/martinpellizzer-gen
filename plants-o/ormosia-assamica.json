    "intro": "Ormosia assamica, commonly known as Assam tallowtree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain oily seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. Ormosia assamica is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
