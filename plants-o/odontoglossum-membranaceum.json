    "intro": "Odontoglossum membranaceum, commonly known as the membranous orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, elongated flower spikes that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This orchid is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
