    "intro": "Orobanche centaurina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of legumes such as vetch and peas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
