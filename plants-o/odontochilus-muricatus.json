    "intro": "Odontochilus muricatus, commonly known as the rough-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees rather than in soil. Odontochilus muricatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
