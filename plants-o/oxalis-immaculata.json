    "intro": "Oxalis immaculata, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. The plant produces small, five-petaled white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
