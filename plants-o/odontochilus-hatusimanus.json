    "intro": "Odontochilus hatusimanus, commonly known as the Hatusiman's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on the petals, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
