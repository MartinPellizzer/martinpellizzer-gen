    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. sabulosa, commonly known as the sandy bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific sandy habitats. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny environments with well-drained soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
