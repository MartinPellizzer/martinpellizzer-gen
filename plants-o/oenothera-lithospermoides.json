It is a perennial herb with showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to arid environments, allowing it to store water efficiently. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals and produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. Oenothera lithospermoides is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions."
