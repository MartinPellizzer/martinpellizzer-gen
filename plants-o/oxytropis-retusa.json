    "intro": "Oxytropis retusa, commonly known as the slender locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in racemes. Oxytropis retusa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open grasslands and rocky soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
