It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically pollinated by nocturnal insects such as moths. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia mackensenii is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid environments and its role in traditional medicine and landscaping."
