    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. rastrera, commonly known as the long-spine prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are often covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its adaptations to arid environments include shallow root systems and the ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The species is also notable for its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
