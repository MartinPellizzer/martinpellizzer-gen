    "intro": "Ophioglossum peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sporangium, which is a unique feature among ferns. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, broad, lanceolate leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in high-altitude regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
