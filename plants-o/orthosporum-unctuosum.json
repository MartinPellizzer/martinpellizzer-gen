    "intro": "Orthosporum unctuosum, commonly known as the woolly orthosporum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Orthosporum unctuosum is primarily of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
