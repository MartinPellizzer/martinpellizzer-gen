    "intro": "Opuntia heliae, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, juicy fruits called tunas. Opuntia heliae is a succulent plant with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
