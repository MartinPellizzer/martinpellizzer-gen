    "intro": "Omphalospora, commonly known as the \"false truffle,\" is a genus of fungi belonging to the family Tulasnellaceae. These fungi are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of various plants, particularly in forest ecosystems. They are characterized by their compact, irregularly shaped fruiting bodies that resemble truffles but lack the spores found in true truffles. Omphalospora species are typically found in association with woody plants and are important in nutrient cycling within soil. Their ecological role is significant in maintaining soil health and supporting plant growth in shaded environments."
