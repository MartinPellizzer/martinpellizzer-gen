    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. murbeckii, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers have a specialized structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, attracting male bees for pollination. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
