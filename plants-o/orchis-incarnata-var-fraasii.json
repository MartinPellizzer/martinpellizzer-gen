    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. fraasii, commonly known as the Fraas's pale orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and wet meadows, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are characteristic of the orchid family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant has a rhizomatous root system. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
