These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of lanceolate, often hairy leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically greenish or reddish in color. Orthechites species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
