    "intro": "Olea humilis, commonly known as the dwarf olive, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar to olives but are typically used for ornamental purposes rather than culinary use. Olea humilis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a valued addition to horticultural collections."
