    "intro": "Oxystophyllum macrostoma, commonly known as the giant sea holly, is a unique marine plant found in shallow coastal waters. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh tidal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting various pollinators. Its root system helps stabilize sandy or muddy substrates, contributing to coastal ecosystem health. Oxystophyllum macrostoma is an important species for both ecological and scientific study due to its specialized adaptations to marine environments."
