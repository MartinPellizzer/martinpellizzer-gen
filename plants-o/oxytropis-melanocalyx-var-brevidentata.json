    "intro": "Oxytropis melanocalyx var. brevidentata, commonly known as the short-toothed locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with short, rounded leaflets and distinctive, short, blunt teeth along the margins. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
