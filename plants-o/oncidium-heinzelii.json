    "intro": "Oncidium heinzelii, commonly known as the Lemon-Scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinct lemon-like scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Oncidium heinzelii is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
