    "intro": "Ophrys aloidea, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. Ophrys aloidea is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, which blooms from late spring to early summer."
