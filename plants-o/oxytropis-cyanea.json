    "intro": "Oxytropis cyanea, commonly known as blue locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis cyanea is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal."
