It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
