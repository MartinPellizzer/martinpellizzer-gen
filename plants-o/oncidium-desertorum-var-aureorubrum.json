It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from golden to reddish-orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The orchid blooms during the dry season, producing clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and hummingbirds."
