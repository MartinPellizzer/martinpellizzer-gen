    "intro": "Olmedia tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovar mountain heather, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to the rugged, coastal environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
