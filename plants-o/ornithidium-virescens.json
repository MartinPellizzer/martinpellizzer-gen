    "intro": "Ornithidium virescens, commonly known as the green feather fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Ornithidium virescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, feathery appearance."
