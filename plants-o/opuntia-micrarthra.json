    "intro": "Opuntia micrarthra, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia micrarthra is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
