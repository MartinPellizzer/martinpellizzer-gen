    "intro": "Oxytropis chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
