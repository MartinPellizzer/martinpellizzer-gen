It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that contain several seeds. Ochna delagoensis is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber."
