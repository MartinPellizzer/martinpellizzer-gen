    "intro": "Orchis convallariifolia, commonly known as the hare's foot orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves that resemble the shape of a hare's foot, hence its common name. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears a cluster of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Orchis convallariifolia typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in woodland habitats with moist, well-drained soil. It is a protected species in some regions due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
