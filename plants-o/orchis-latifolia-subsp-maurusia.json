It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces a spike of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks.
