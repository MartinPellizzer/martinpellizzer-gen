It features vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that often has a contrasting color. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the environment, and it thrives in warm, humid conditions. Oncidium pardoglossum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
