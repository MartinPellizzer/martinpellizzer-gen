    "intro": "Orobanche salsa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique reproductive strategy involving the release of tiny seeds that can remain dormant in soil for years. The plant is often found in Mediterranean regions and can parasitize a variety of host species, including those in the Brassicaceae family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops it infests."
