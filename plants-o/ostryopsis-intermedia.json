    "intro": "Ostryopsis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate osier, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Betulaceae, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its slender, flexible stems. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Ostryopsis intermedia is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in wet or moist soil conditions."
