It is a climbing vine characterized by its angular, ridged stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
