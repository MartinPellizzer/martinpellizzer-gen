    "intro": "Orthosia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orthosia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and cliffs. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pink or purple in color. Orthosia stenophylla is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment."
