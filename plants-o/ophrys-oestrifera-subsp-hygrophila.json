    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking orchid-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower per stem. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. This subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures."
