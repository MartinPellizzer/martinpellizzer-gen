    "intro": "Orchis rivularis, commonly known as the water orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other damp environments, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are arranged in a loose spike. Orchis rivularis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem."
