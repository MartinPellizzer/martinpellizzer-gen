    "intro": "Oncostemum pustulosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed pustule plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its hairy, pustule-like structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its small, yellow flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and it produces oval, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oncostemum pustulosum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
