    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. bansica, commonly known as the Banska rice, is a variant of rice native to the Himalayan region of India. It is characterized by its short, slender grains and is typically cultivated in high-altitude areas with cooler climates. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces panicles of small, white flowers. This variety is valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is an important crop for local communities in the region."
