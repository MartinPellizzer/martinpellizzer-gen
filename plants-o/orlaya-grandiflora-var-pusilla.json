    "intro": "Orlaya grandiflora var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf marsh marigold, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It features bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has thin, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Its flowers are typically clustered in a single umbel, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Orlaya grandiflora var. pusilla is well adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in riparian zones."
