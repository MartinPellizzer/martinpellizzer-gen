    "intro": "Oxytropis leucotricha, commonly known as white-haired locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. Oxytropis leucotricha is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
