It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and tall, erect flowering stems. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive lip that is often more elongated than in the typical species. This form is found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. It is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer."
