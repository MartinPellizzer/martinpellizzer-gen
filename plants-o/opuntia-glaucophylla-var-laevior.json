    "intro": "Opuntia glaucophylla var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth-leaved prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in areoles, from which both spines and flowers emerge. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and exhibiting drought tolerance."
