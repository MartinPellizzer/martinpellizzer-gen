    "intro": "Oncidium hauensteinii, commonly known as the Hauenstein's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium hauensteinii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
