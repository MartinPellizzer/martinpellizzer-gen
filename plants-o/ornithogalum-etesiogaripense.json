    "intro": "Ornithogalum etesiogaripense, commonly known as the Etesiogarip Peninsula star-of-Bethleem, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It produces clusters of fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
