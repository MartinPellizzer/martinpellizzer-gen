It is characterized by its soft, cotton-like cap that is often white or pale yellow in color. The stem is typically short and slender, with a fibrous texture that distinguishes it from other similar species. It is often found in moist, wooded areas, growing in association with decaying wood. This fungus is notable for its delicate appearance and is sometimes collected for culinary use when properly identified."
