    "intro": "Ormiscus pinnatus, commonly known as the featherleaf ormiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Ormiscus pinnatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
