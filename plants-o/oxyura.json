    "intro": "Oxyura, commonly known as the moorhen, is a genus of waterfowl belonging to the family Anatidae. These birds are primarily found in wetland habitats such as marshes, ponds, and lakes. The genus includes several species, including the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) and the African moorhen (Oxyura leucoptera). They are characterized by their dark plumage, short necks, and strong legs adapted for swimming and walking in aquatic environments. Oxyura species play an important role in wetland ecosystems by controlling insect populations and serving as prey for larger predators."
