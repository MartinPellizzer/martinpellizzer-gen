It is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flowers that feature a prominent, winged lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and dark green color. Ophrys alata is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting male bees through mimicry of female bees."
