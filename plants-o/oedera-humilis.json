    "intro": "Oedera humilis, commonly known as the low oedera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters. Oedera humilis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
