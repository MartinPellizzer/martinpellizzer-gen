    "intro": "Oxalis pseudoarenaria, commonly known as the sand oxalis, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that resemble those of other oxalis species, often with a distinctive pattern of veins. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
