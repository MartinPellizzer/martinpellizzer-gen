    "intro": "Oxybasis urbica, commonly known as the urban dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and urban areas, due to its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and summer, followed by the characteristic seed heads that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Oxybasis urbica is often considered a weed but has ecological value by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
