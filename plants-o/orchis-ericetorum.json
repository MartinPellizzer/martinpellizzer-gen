    "intro": "Orchis ericetorum, commonly known as the heath orchid, is a species of orchid native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It typically grows in acidic, heathland environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. Orchis ericetorum is a perennial herb that blooms from June to August, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and habitat specificity."
