It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous structure that serves as its storage organ and helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight bluish tint. Ornithogalum lychnite is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
