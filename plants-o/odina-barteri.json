It typically grows in wet, sunny habitats such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Odina barteri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
