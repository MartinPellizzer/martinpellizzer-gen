    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. rubra, commonly known as red rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its reddish grain color due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments. It is native to Asia and is often cultivated as a traditional crop in countries like India and China. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in panicles, and it is primarily pollinated by wind. The grains of red rice are generally smaller and harder than those of common white rice, contributing to its distinct culinary and nutritional profile."
