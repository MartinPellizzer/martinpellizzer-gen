    "intro": "Onychium dulongjiangense, commonly known as the Dulongjiang onychium, is a rare alpine plant native to the Himalayan region of China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or gravelly soils, and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
