It is characterized by its vivid yellow and orange flowers, which are often described as resembling sulfur or flame. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has a slender, erect stem with a single spike of showy, spurred flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often protected and found in limited geographical regions."
