    "intro": "Odontocyclus, commonly known as the toothed cycad, is a genus of cycads native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Odontocyclus species produce cones rather than flowers, and their reproductive structures are typically separate, with male and female cones on different plants. The genus is notable for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Mesozoic era."
