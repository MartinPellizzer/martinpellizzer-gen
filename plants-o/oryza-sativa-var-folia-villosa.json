    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. folia-villosa, commonly known as the hairy-leaf rice, is a variant of the rice plant characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves. This variety is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant has a short growth cycle, making it suitable for multiple harvests in a single growing season. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name and contribute to its unique appearance. The grain produced by this variety is similar to other rice types but is often prized for its texture and flavor in local cuisines."
