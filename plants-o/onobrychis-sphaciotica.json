    "intro": "Onobrychis sphaciotica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can contribute to soil fertility in agricultural settings."
