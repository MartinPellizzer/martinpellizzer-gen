    "intro": "Onoclea intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water shield, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy coating, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes. It produces small, round fruits that disperse via water, aiding in its spread. Onoclea intermedia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and waterfowl."
