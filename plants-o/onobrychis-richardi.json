    "intro": "Onobrychis richardi, commonly known as the red clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Onobrychis richardi is also valued for its use in forage and as a soil enrichment plant."
