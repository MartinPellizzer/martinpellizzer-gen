    "intro": "Olea europaea var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, fleshy olives that are typically harvested for culinary and commercial use. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. It thrives in warm, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its high oil content and is widely cultivated for both food and oil production."
