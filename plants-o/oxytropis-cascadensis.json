It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis cascadensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
