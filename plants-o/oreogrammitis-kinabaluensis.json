    "intro": "Oreogrammitis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu moss, is a rare and endemic liverwort species found exclusively on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded microhabitats, often on rock surfaces or decaying wood. Its small, intricate leaves are arranged in a tight rosette, and it plays a vital role in the unique ecosystems of the mountain's rainforest. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator of the region's ecological health."
