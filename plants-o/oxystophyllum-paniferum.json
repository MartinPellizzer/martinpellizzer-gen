    "intro": "Oxystophyllum paniferum, commonly known as the giant cup plant, is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to livestock, making it important to identify for agricultural safety. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its robust growth and showy flowers make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
