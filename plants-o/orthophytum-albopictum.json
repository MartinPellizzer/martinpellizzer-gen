    "intro": "Orthophytum albopictum, commonly known as the White-veined Zebra Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white and green stripes, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. It is a succulent plant that stores water in its fleshy stems, making it drought-tolerant. Orthophytum albopictum prefers well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
