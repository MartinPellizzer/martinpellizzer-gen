    "intro": "Orophochilus, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. Orophochilus species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, where they form dense mats or small clumps. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many species are threatened by habitat loss and climate change."
