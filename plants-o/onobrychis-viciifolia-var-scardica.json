    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia var. scardica, commonly known as the Scardic goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
