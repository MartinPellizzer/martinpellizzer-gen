    "intro": "Orogenia leibergii, commonly known as the Leiberg's orogenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, while its flowers are usually blue or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orogenia leibergii is considered a species of conservation concern."
