    "intro": "Ophiopogon aciformis, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue or black berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form a dense ground cover."
