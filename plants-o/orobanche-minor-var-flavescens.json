    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish, branched stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
