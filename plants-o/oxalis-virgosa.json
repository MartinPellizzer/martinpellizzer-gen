    "intro": "Oxalis virgosa, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet resembling a heart shape, and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in partial to full shade. Oxalis virgosa is also noted for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
