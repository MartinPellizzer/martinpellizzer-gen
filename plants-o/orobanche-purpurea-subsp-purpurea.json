    "intro": "Orobanche purpurea subsp. purpurea, commonly known as the purple witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. It produces small, fleshy seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops, making it a concern for farmers."
