    "intro": "Oncidium suave, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its roots are adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with good air circulation. Oncidium suave is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
