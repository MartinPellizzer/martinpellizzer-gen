It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a woody stem and produces leaves that are broad and ovate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
