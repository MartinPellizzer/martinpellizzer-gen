These plants are characterized by their distinctive, elongated pods that resemble a bird's beak, giving them their common name. They are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a range of colors from white to purple. Ornithoboea species are often used in traditional medicine and can also serve as forage for livestock in certain regions."
