    "intro": "Oxytropis ampullata, commonly known as the bottlebrush lupine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble bottles, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Oxytropis ampullata is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has adaptations for nitrogen fixation, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
