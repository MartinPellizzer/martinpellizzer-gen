    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia polyacantha is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
