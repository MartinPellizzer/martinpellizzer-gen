It features fleshy, round leaves that are typically silver or gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping.

Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
