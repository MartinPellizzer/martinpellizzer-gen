    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. argentaria, commonly known as the silver bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with a distinctive silver or white marking on the lip. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
