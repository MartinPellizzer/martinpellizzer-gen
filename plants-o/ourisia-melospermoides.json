    "intro": "Ourisia melospermoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ourisia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Ourisia melospermoides thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or high-altitude regions."
