    "intro": "Ononis pusilla f. macrantha, commonly known as the dwarf whitlow grass, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe. It features small, basal leaves that are typically hairy and linear in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats. Due to its resilience and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and delicate floral display."
