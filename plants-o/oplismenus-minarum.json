    "intro": "Oplismenus minarum, commonly known as the creeping smartweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens. Its leaves are lance-shaped, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Oplismenus minarum is often found in wet or moist soils, such as along stream banks or in marshy areas."
