    "intro": "Ornithogalum longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care, though the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty. It is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
