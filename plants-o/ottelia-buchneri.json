    "intro": "Ottelia buchneri, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are rounded and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and sun-like, with numerous stamens, and it produces small, dark seeds. Ottelia buchneri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
