    "intro": "Orobanche bungeana, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India, China, and Nepal. The plant produces small, pink to reddish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no leaves. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including agricultural crops like wheat and barley. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a hemiparasite."
