It typically has wiry, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower per stem, which blooms in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, arid environments."
