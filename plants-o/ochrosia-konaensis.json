    "intro": "Ochrosia konaensis, commonly known as Kona orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas, often in the understory of native forests. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ochrosia konaensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
