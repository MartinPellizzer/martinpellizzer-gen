    "intro": "Orobanche fusca, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish stem and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are usually small and pale, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Orobanche fusca is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature and ability to reduce crop yields."
