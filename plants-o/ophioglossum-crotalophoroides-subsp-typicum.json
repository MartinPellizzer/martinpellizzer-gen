    "intro": "Ophioglossum crotalophoroides subsp. typicum, commonly known as the typical adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a fleshy, spore-bearing sporangium that is prominently positioned on a short stalk, resembling an adder's tongue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a distinctive, elongated shape. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
