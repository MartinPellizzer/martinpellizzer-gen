    "intro": "Olea europaea var. rubra, commonly known as the scarlet olive, is a variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, red berries that remain on the tree throughout the winter, providing ornamental value. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a silvery underside that adds to its visual appeal. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic qualities rather than its fruit, which is less commonly used for olive oil production."
