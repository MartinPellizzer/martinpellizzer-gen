    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. lupercalis, commonly known as the wolf's beard orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-brown with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. The subspecies is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological niche within its native range."
