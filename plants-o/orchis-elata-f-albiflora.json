    "intro": "Orchis elata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered greater orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip, which plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect species. This orchid is considered a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity."
