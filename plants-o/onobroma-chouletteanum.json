    "intro": "Onobroma chouletteanum, commonly known as the Choulette's wax apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its large, showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often covered in a waxy coating, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
