    "intro": "Osmunda lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf royal fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive two-year growth cycle, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda lanceolata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
