    "intro": "Odontites pseudogranatensis, commonly known as the granate odontite, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
