    "intro": "Ocimum glaucum, commonly known as blue basil, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-blue in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to purplish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warm seasons. Its aromatic leaves are often used in culinary and medicinal applications, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Ocimum glaucum thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
