    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. aranifera, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that serve as a mimicry mechanism to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellowish-green with intricate patterns that resemble the body of a bee. The subspecies aranifera is distinguished by its specific floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to other subspecies of Ophrys insectifera."
