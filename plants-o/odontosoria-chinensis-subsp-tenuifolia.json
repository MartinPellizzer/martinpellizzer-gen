    "intro": "Odontosoria chinensis subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved tooth fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across forest floors. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in fine hairs. This species prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
