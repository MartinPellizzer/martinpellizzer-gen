    "intro": "Ornanthes lutea, commonly known as the yellow ornanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ornanthes lutea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
