    "intro": "Orchis militaris f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a rare and distinctive variant of the military orchid. It is characterized by its elongated bracts that enclose the flower spike, giving it a unique appearance. This orchid is typically found in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale purple to white, with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
