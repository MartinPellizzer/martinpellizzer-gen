    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris var. major, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the fruit, known as a tunai, is edible and commonly used in culinary applications. The plant's unique morphology and adaptations make it well-suited for desert ecosystems."
