    "intro": "Olearia stellulata var. frostii, commonly known as the Frost's Daisy, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its pale blooms. It is well adapted to coastal environments and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils."
