    "intro": "Ormycarpus, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Costaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary economic product. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, giving it its common name, while its flowers are small and clustered in spikes. Ormycarpus is valued for its starchy roots, which are used as a food source and thickening agent in cooking."
