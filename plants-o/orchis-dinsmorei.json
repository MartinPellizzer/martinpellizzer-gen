    "intro": "Orchis dinsmorei, commonly known as Dinsmore's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to specific regions of the United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces tall, slender stems with showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring and early summer, with its flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
