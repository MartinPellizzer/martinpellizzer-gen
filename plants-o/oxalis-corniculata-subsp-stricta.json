    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata subsp. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia and parts of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The leaves and flowers are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
