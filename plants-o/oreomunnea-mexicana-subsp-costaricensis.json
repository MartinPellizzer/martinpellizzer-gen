    "intro": "Oreomunnea mexicana subsp. costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican oreomunnea, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, often hairy stems and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary growth and forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
