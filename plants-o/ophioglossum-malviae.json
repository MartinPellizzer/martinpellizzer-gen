    "intro": "Ophioglossum malviae, commonly known as the Malvian adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ophioglossaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant has a primitive morphology, with a single unbranched stem and a broad, lance-shaped leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
