It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called cyathia, a typical feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Octopleura loeselioides is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests."
