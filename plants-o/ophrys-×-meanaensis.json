    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 meanaensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, typically a wasp or bee, to attract specific pollinators. The plant is native to southern Europe, particularly in regions where the parent species co-occur. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its reproductive strategy relies heavily on mimicry and specific pollination mechanisms, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant evolution and pollination biology."
