    "intro": "Oxydectes pedunculata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its native arid environment. Oxydectes pedunculata is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
