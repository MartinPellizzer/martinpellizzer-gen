    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 boscoquartensis nothosubsp. difesae, commonly known as the Boscoquartensis bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its intricate floral structures that mimic female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped lip, a feature typical of many Ophrys species. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
