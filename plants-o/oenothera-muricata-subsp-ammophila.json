    "intro": "Oenothera muricata subsp. ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal bluffs. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenothera muricata subsp. ammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing nectar for pollinators."
