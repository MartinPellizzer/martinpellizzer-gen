    "intro": "Orobus nicolai, commonly known as the Nicolai's orobus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Orobus nicolai is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
