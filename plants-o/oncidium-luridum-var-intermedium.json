It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green striped flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with intermittent rainfall. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its striking floral display."
