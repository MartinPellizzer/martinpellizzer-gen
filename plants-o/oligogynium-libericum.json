    "intro": "Oligogynium libericum, commonly known as the European rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, ditches, and along waterways. It has small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spike-like inflorescences, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Oligogynium libericum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
