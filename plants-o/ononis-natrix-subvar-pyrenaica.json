It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds by wind. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
