    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. traunsteineri, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's pink orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a slender, upright stem with few leaves and produces a single flower spike that can bear several flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, often in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
