    "intro": "Oryza sativa, commonly known as rice, is a grass species native to the warmer regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stalks and small, clustered spikelets that produce grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in flooded conditions, making it a staple in paddy fields. Its seeds, which are the edible part, are rich in carbohydrates and are a primary food source for billions of people worldwide. The plant's reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal monsoons, which influence its growth and yield."
