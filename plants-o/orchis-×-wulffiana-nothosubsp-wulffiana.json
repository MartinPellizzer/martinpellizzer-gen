It is a terrestrial herb with a rosette of linear, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and the plant is adapted to moist, calcareous soils. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on its parent species."
