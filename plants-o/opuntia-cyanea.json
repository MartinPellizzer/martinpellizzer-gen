    "intro": "Opuntia cyanea, commonly known as the rainbow cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are often ribbed and covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to deep purple, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia cyanea is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native regions."
