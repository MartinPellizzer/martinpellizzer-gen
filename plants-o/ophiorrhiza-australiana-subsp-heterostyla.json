    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza australiana subsp. heterostyla, commonly known as the Australian hairy root vine, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy, red berries. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of forests. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
