It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along stream banks."
