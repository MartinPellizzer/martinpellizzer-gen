    "intro": "Olearia stellulata f. canescens, commonly known as the silver-haired dandelion bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
