    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 viridella, commonly known as the green twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species that occurs naturally in parts of Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heaths. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
