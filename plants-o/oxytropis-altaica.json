It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock, making it a significant concern in grazing areas. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor regions."
