    "intro": "Odontandra, commonly known as the toothed sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody shrubs or small trees with compound leaves and small, often clustered flowers. The plant is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with dry or semi-arid climates. Odontandra species are valued for their hard, aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of timber. The genus is also notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
