    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. legitima, commonly known as the true sandspur, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive spiny fruits. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
