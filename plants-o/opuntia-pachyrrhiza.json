    "intro": "Opuntia pachyrrhiza, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of spiny flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pachyrrhiza plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
