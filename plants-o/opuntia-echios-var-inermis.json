    "intro": "Opuntia echios var. inermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and dark green, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of edible fruit."
