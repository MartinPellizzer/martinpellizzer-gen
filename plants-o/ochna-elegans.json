    "intro": "Ochna elegans, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It features simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in a range of soil types and climatic conditions."
