    "intro": "Orobanche owerinii var. woronowii, commonly known as the African witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Africa, particularly in the savannas and grasslands. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, and it has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. Its parasitic nature allows it to attach to the roots of host plants, often causing significant damage to agricultural crops. Due to its invasive potential and impact on agriculture, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
