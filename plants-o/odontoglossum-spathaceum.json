    "intro": "Odontoglossum spathaceum, commonly known as the Spathe Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a white or pale pink spathaceous bract with a contrasting lip. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Odontoglossum spathaceum is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in both greenhouse and outdoor settings."
