    "intro": "Oncidium obstipum, commonly known as the stiff-leaved orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, stiff leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. Oncidium obstipum is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
