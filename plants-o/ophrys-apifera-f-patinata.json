    "intro": "Ophrys apifera f. patinata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. This orchid is a hemiparasitic species, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
