    "intro": "Oxygyne hyodoi, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a aquatic plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that often form a rosette shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Oxygyne hyodoi is often used in ornamental water gardens and serves as an important food source for aquatic herbivores."
