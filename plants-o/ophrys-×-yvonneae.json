    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 yvonneae, commonly known as the Yvonne's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a complex, bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys \u00d7 yvonneae is considered a rare and endangered species."
