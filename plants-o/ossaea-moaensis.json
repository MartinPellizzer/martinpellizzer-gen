    "intro": "Ossaea moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's grass, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses and sedges. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. Ossaea moaensis was likely an important component of the pre-human New Zealand ecosystem. However, it is now considered extinct, with the last known populations disappearing after the arrival of humans and the extinction of the moa birds."
