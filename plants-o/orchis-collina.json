    "intro": "Orchis collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish flowers with a lip that is often darker in color. Orchis collina thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for biodiverse habitats and its ecological value to pollinators."
