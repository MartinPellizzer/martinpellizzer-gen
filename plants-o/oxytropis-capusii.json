    "intro": "Oxytropis capusii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Oxytropis capusii is known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
