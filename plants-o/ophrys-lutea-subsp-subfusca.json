    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. subfusca, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble bees, a feature that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a sympodial growth habit, with the stems becoming woody at the base over time. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette."
