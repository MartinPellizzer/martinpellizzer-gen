    "intro": "Oxygonum humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive whorls of opposite, fleshy, succulent leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are adapted for gas exchange and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Oxygonum humbertii is also known for its ability to trap and digest small invertebrates, making it a specialized carnivorous plant."
