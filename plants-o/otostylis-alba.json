    "intro": "Otostylis alba, commonly known as the white otostylis, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its striking white spadix surrounded by a green spathe. The plant typically grows in wet tropical environments, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade. Its reproductive structures are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly beetles and flies. Otostylis alba is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and wetland restoration projects."
