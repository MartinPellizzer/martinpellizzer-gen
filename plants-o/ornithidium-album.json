    "intro": "Ornithidium album, commonly known as the white orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it challenging to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
