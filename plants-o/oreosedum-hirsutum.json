    "intro": "Oreosedum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Oreosedum hirsutum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its hardiness and drought tolerance."
