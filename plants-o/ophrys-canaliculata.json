    "intro": "Ophrys canaliculata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble female wasps, a trait known as mimicry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas and thrives in humid environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by bees and wasps. Ophrys canaliculata is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, elongated lip that mimics the appearance of a wasp's abdomen."
