    "intro": "Oxalis verticillata, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are often described as resembling clover, with a bright green color and a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense, low-growing mats."
