    "intro": "Omphalodes littoralis subsp. gallaecica, commonly known as the Galician coastal bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western coast of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, often in maritime climates with high salt exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. It is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand strong winds and wave action. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh coastal conditions."
