    "intro": "Oribasia paniculata, commonly known as the desert panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh desert conditions. Oribasia paniculata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range."
