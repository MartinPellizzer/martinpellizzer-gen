    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza undulata, commonly known as the undulate mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in brackish water environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater and tidal fluctuations contributes to its ecological significance in coastal habitats."
