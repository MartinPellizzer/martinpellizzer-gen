    "intro": "Oedera apiculata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Oedera apiculata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
