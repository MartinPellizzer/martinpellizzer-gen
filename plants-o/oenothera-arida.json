    "intro": "Oenothera arida, commonly known as desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oenothera arida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss."
