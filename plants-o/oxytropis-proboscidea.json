    "intro": "Oxytropis proboscidea, commonly known as the winged milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are compound, with narrow, elongated leaflets that help reduce water loss. Oxytropis proboscidea is also known for its distinctive seed pods, which are inflated and often have a wing-like structure."
