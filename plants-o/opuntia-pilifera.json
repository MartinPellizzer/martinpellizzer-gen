    "intro": "Opuntia pilifera, commonly known as the hairless prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia pilifera is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert climates and xeriscaping."
