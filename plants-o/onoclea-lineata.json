    "intro": "Onoclea lineata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water clover, is a perennial fern native to North America. It features distinctive, bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are usually 30 to 60 centimeters long and have a soft, feathery texture. Onoclea lineata plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization."
