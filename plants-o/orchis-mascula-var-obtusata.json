    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. obtusata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved early purple orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and a striking inflorescence of purple or violet flowers with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and grasslands. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
