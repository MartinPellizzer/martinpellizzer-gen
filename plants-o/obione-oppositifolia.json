    "intro": "Obione oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaf obione, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, where leaves grow in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Obione oppositifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
