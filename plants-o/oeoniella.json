    "intro": "Oeoniella, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Montiaceae. It consists of several species that are typically small, mat-forming plants with succulent leaves. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and South Africa. Oeoniella species are characterized by their fleshy, often blue-green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often storing water in their leaves to withstand prolonged droughts."
