It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. It is often found in mountainous areas and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
