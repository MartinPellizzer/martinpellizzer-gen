    "intro": "Ornithogalum fragrans, commonly known as sweet sword lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces umbels of white or pale pink flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its flowers typically bloom in spring or early summer, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ornithogalum fragrans is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soils."
