    "intro": "Ophiuros gracilis, commonly known as the slender sea whip, is a marine organism belonging to the class Anthozoa, specifically the order Scleractinia. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure composed of a calcareous skeleton, which provides structural support. The polyps of Ophiuros gracilis are typically small and may extend during feeding, capturing plankton from the water. This species is often found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches to hard substrates such as rocks or coral. Its presence contributes to the biodiversity and ecological balance of marine environments."
