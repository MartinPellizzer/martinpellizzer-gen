    "intro": "Othonna schaeferi, commonly known as the Schaefer's othonna, is a succulent perennial plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Othonna schaeferi is known for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
