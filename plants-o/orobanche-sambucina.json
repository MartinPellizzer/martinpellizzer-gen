    "intro": "Orobanche sambucina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and wild plants it infests."
