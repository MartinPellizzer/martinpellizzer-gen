It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high elevations. The plant features a pseudobulb with a single leaf, and its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish with a distinctive lip. It produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a rare ornamental plant."
