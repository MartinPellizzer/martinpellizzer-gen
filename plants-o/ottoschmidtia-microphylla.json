    "intro": "Ottoschmidtia microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees. It has small, scale-like leaves and produces white or pink berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host tree over time. It is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America, and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems. Its unique life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host and other mistletoe species."
