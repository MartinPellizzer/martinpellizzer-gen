It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
