    "intro": "Orchiodes pubescens, commonly known as the hairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of other orchid species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
