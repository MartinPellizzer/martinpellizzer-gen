    "intro": "Orthomene prancei, commonly known as the Prance's orthomene, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a glossy texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orthomene prancei is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
