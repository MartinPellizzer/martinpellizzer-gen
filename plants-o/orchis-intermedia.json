    "intro": "Orchis intermedia, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and meadows, and it often grows in shaded environments. Its root system is adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Orchis intermedia is also of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
