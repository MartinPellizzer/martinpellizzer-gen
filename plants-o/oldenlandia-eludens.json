    "intro": "Oldenlandia eludens, commonly known as the \"shy plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its rapid leaf movement in response to touch, a phenomenon known as thigmonastic response. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting insects for pollination. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Oldenlandia eludens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices."
