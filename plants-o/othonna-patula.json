    "intro": "Othonna patula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Othonna patula is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
