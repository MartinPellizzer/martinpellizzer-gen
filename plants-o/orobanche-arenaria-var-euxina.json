    "intro": "Orobanche arenaria var. euxina, commonly known as the sand orobanche, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
