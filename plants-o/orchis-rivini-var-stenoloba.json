    "intro": "Orchis rivini var. stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale pink or greenish flowers. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, typically with three to five blooms, and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
