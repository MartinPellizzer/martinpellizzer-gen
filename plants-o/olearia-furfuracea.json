    "intro": "Olearia furfuracea, commonly known as the silverweed tree or silver bush, is a shrub-like plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environments. Olearia furfuracea is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
