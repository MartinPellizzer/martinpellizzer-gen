    "intro": "Ourisia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved ourisia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. Its leaves are broad and leathery, providing a striking contrast to its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. Ourisia macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
