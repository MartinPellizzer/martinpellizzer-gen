    "intro": "Oxytropis tunliaoensis, commonly known as the Tunliao locoweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Oxytropis tunliaoensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain wildlife species."
