    "intro": "Oenothera marinellae, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Oenothera marinellae is an important species for both ecological and botanical studies due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
