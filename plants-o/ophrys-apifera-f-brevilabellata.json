It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its specialized pollination strategy. The plant features a single, showy flower with a pouch-like lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. This orchid is known for its ecological importance and is often protected due to its declining populations."
