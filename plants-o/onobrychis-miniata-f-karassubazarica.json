    "intro": "Onobrychis miniata f. karassubazarica, commonly known as the Karassubazar clover, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
