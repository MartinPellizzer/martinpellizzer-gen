    "intro": "Ottelia alismoides var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf waterplantain, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, often emerging above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in shallow water environments. Ottelia alismoides var. cordifolia is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
