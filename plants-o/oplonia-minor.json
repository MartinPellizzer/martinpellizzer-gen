    "intro": "Oplonia minor, commonly known as the lesser oplopanax, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that are toxic to humans. Oplonia minor typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
