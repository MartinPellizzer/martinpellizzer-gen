    "intro": "Orontium, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant belonging to the family Alismataceae. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating on the surface while its roots anchor in the substrate. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its leaves are broad and shield-shaped, which gives it its common name. Orontium is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
