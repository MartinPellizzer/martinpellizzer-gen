    "intro": "Ophrys balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Ophrys balcanica is a herbaceous perennial, often reaching a height of up to 30 centimeters."
