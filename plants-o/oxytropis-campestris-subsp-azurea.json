    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris subsp. azurea, commonly known as blue locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in large quantities."
