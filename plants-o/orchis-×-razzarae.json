    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 razzarae, commonly known as the Razzarae orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis \u00d7 razzarae exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
