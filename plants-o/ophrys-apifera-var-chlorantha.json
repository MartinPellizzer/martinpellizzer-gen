    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. chlorantha, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow flowers that resemble bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its specialized relationship with certain pollinators, particularly male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's lip."
