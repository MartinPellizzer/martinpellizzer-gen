    "intro": "Orobanche laxissima, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on the roots of grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistence in certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
