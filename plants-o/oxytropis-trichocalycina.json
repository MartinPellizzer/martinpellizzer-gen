    "intro": "Oxytropis trichocalycina, commonly known as the hairy calyx oxytropis, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Oxytropis trichocalycina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
