    "intro": "Orobanche leucantha, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas and is often found parasitizing members of the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
