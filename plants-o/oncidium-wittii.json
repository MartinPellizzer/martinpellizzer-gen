    "intro": "Oncidium wittii, commonly known as the Witt's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, typical of its epiphytic lifestyle. Oncidium wittii thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
