It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
