    "intro": "Oryza repens, commonly known as watergrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in clusters. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Its reproductive system involves wind pollination, and it produces small, oval-shaped grains. Oryza repens plays a role in maintaining wetland ecosystems and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
