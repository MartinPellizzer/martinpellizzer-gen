    "intro": "Onobrychis brnoensis, commonly known as Brno clover, is a perennial legume native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
