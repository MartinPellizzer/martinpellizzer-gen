    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. parnellii, commonly known as the Parnell rice, is a wild rice species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and is adapted to fluctuating water levels. Its grains are smaller and less productive compared to cultivated rice varieties. It plays a role in ecological studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for hybridization with domesticated rice."
