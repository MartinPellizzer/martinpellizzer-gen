    "intro": "Orchis pallens, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Orchis pallens is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands."
