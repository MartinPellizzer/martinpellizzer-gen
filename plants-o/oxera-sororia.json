    "intro": "Oxera sororia, commonly known as the New Zealand oxera, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. Oxera sororia is often found in coastal and forested areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
