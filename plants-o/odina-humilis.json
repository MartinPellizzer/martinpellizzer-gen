It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem.
