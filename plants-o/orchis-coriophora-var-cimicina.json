It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a short flowering period and is often difficult to detect due to its inconspicuous appearance. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
