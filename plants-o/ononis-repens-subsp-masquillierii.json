    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. masquillierii, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It has a mat-forming growth habit, which helps it stabilize loose soils and prevent erosion. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
