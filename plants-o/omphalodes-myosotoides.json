It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. The flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, creating a bell-like appearance that gives the plant its common name."
