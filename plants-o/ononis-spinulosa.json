It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ononis spinulosa thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands."
