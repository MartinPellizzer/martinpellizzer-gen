    "intro": "Oxalis floribunda subsp. ostenii, commonly known as the rock oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky outcrops and mountainous regions, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
