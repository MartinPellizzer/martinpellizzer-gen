    "intro": "Onobrychis albiflora, commonly known as white clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial legume that typically forms dense mats on lawns and grassy areas. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its trifoliate leaves are characteristic of the Fabaceae family, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Onobrychis albiflora is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
