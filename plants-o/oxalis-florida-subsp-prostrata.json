    "intro": "Oxalis florida subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow veins and small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
