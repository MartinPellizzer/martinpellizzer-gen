It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring. Onobroma cynaroides has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
