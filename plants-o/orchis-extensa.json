    "intro": "Orchis extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Orchis extensa is an important species for pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
