    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 bugarachensis, commonly known as the Bugarach orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, spurred flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in certain regions."
