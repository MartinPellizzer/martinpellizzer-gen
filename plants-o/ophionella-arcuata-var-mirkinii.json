The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch of color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
