    "intro": "Olsynium stoloniferum, commonly known as the stoloniferous olsynium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a robust root system and produces erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Olsynium stoloniferum is well adapted to drought conditions and can spread via stolons, forming dense mats in its native habitat."
