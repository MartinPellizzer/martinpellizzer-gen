    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza ferruginea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or ironwood, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically valued for its use in traditional crafts and construction."
