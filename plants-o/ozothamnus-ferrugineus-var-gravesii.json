It features small, yellowish-green leaves that are covered in fine, rusty-colored hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
