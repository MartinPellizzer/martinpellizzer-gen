    "intro": "Oxyacantha apiifolia, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its root system is extensive and can produce numerous shoots, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Oxyacantha apiifolia is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including dry and rocky conditions."
