    "intro": "Osmanthus americanus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the Chinese osmanthus or small-leaf fragrant wood, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections. Its ornamental value comes from its aromatic foliage and showy blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
