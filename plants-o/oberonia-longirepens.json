    "intro": "Oberonia longirepens, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Oberonia longirepens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
