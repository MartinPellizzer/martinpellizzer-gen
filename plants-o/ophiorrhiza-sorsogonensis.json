    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers. This species typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing host tree health and providing food for various insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant."
