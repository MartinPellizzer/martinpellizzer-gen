    "intro": "Oxytropis pilosa subsp. pilosa, commonly known as hairy filaree, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many leguminous species. Oxytropis pilosa subsp. pilosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
