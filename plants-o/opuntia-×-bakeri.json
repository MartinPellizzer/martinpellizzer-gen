    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are modified leaves adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, mild flavor. Opuntia \u00d7 bakeri is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
