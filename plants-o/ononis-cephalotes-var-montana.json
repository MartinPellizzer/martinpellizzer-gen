    "intro": "Ononis cephalotes var. montana, commonly known as mountain tawny cowslip, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments."
