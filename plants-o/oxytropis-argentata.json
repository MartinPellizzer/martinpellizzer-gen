    "intro": "Oxytropis argentata, commonly known as silver locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Oxytropis argentata is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules."
