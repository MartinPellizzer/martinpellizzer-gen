    "intro": "Orobanche brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of visible leaves, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
