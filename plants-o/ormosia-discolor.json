    "intro": "Ormosia discolor, commonly known as the red-flowered ormosia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with numerous small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruits are woody capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation in natural habitats. Ormosia discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
