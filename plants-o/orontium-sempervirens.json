    "intro": "Orontium sempervirens, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and pond margins. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
