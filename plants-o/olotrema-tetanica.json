    "intro": "Olotrema tetanica, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with certain fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
