    "intro": "Oberonia labidoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-lip orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid and cool environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Oberonia labidoglossa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
