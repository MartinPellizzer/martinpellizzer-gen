    "intro": "Ornithoglossum viride var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the green orchid or green lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers that resemble orchids, with long, narrow petals and a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
