    "intro": "Oxytropis megalantha, commonly known as the giant locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, hard, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open plains. Oxytropis megalantha is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which can improve soil fertility in degraded landscapes."
