    "intro": "Ornithogalum ursulae var. longiracemosum, commonly known as the long-stemmed ursula lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched stems that bear numerous white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its elongated racemes, which give it its specific epithet \"longiracemosum.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance."
