    "intro": "Orchis saccata, commonly known as the sac\u56ca orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a raceme, with a distinctive lip petal that is often marked with purple spots. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats. Orchis saccata is also known for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
