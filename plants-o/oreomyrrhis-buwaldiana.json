    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis buwaldiana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in meadows or along stream banks. Oreomyrrhis buwaldiana has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
