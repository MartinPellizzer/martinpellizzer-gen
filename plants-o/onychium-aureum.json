    "intro": "Onychium aureum, commonly known as golden onychium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often vibrant flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
