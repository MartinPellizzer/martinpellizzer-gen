    "intro": "Opuntia robusta var. megacantha, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its thick, waxy skin helps it store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. The plant's spines, which are modified leaves, provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration."
