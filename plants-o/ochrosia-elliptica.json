    "intro": "Ochrosia elliptica, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or grayish coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the dry season. Its root system is fibrous, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Ochrosia elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
