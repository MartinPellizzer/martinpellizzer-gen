    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale purple to pinkish flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. This variety is distinguished by its dense arrangement of flowers, which sets it apart from other orchid species in the genus."
