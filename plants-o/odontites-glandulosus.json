    "intro": "Odontites glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky rock-cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in glandular hairs, giving them a sticky texture. Its small, white or yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. Odontites glandulosus is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
