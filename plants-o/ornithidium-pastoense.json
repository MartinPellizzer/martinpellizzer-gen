    "intro": "Ornithidium pastoense, commonly known as the Pasto orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often growing on trees in humid tropical forests. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, typical of many orchid species. Ornithidium pastoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
