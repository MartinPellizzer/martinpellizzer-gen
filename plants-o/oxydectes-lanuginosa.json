    "intro": "Oxydectes lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its seed heads produce small, parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Oxydectes lanuginosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
