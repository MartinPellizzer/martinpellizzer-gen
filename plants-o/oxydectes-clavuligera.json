    "intro": "Oxydectes clavuligera, commonly known as the clustered ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescence and its striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths and bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oxydectes clavuligera is considered critically endangered in its native range."
