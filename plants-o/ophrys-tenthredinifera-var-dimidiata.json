    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. dimidiata, commonly known as the half-winged bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings, resembling the body of a bee. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
