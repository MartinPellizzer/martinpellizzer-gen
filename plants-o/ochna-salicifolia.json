    "intro": "Ochna salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved ochna, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that resemble those of willow trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Ochna salicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
