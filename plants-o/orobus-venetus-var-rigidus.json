    "intro": "Orobus venetus var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are covered in stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, curved pods containing several seeds. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation."
