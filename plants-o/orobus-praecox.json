    "intro": "Orobus praecox, commonly known as early sweet vernalgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, spike-like inflorescence that appears early in the growing season. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Orobus praecox is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
