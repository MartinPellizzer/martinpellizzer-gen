    "intro": "Oxalis palmifrons, commonly known as the palm-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features striking, palmate leaves that resemble a miniature palm tree, with each leaflet being heart-shaped and often adorned with a distinctive white or yellowish bloom. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. Oxalis palmifrons is also valued for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense ground covers in suitable conditions."
