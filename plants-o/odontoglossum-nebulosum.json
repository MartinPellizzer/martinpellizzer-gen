    "intro": "Odontoglossum nebulosum, commonly known as the Cloudy Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers with intricate patterns that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect excess light. Odontoglossum nebulosum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has swollen stems that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat."
