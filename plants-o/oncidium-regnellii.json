    "intro": "Oncidium regnellii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching inflorescences with clusters of bright yellow, butterfly-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often used for propagation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot. Oncidium regnellii is prized for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms and is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
