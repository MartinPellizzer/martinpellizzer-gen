    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis var. sensibilis, commonly known as sensitive fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are sensitive to touch and moisture. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's name reflects its sensitivity to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
