    "intro": "Ornithidium toriferum, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread effectively. Ornithidium toriferum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
