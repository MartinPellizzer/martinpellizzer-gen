    "intro": "Onopordum illyricum subsp. ferox, commonly known as the fierce thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and large, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its robust growth and hardy nature make it a common weed in disturbed areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its more aggressive growth compared to other forms of Onopordum illyricum."
