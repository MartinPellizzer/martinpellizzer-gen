It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy.

Its floral structure features a labellum that resembles a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
