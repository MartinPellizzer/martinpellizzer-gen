    "intro": "Oreoherzogia \u00d7 lemaniana, commonly known as the hybrid leopard's ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble a leopard's ear. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in the wild."
