    "intro": "Oleandra micans, commonly known as the silverleaf oleander, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. However, it is toxic, with all parts of the plant containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
