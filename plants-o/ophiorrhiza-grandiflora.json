    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandalwood, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
