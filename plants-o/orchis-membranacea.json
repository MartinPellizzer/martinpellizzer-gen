    "intro": "Orchis membranacea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble those of the orchid family but lack the typical petals and sepals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air, rain, and debris for sustenance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it produces a unique structure called a rostellum, which is a specialized part of the flower involved in pollination. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, Orchis membranacea is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered a conservation concern."
