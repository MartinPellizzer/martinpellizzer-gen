    "intro": "Orobanche major var. forojuliensis, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for many years, contributing to its persistence in certain ecosystems. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant interactions and ecosystem dynamics."
