    "intro": "Orcuttia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy orcuttia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Orcuttia pilosa is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils in desert regions. Its unique adaptations make it a specialized species within its ecosystem."
