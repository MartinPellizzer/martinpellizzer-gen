It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, usually from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged alternately along the stem. Orlaya pumila is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
