    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 holubyana, commonly known as the Holub\u00fd's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in regions of Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic and neighboring countries. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Ophrys \u00d7 holubyana is a short-lived perennial, often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
