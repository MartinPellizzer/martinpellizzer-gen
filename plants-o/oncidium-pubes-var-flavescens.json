    "intro": "Oncidium pubes var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, showy flowers with yellow and green hues, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually long, narrow, and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
