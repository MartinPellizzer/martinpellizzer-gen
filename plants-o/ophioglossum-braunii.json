    "intro": "Ophioglossum braunii, commonly known as the Braun's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sporophylls that bear the spores, and its leaves are usually narrow and elongated. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a unique reproductive system, with separate male and female plants, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophioglossum braunii is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
