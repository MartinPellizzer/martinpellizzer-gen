    "intro": "Ovidia pillopillo, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often followed by oval, woody fruits. Ovidia pillopillo is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
