    "intro": "Oncidium angustisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a rhizome that produces a cluster of pseudobulbs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, often with a contrasting lip. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium angustisepalum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
