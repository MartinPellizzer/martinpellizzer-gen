    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 macrostachys, commonly known as the large bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown with intricate patterns, and it produces small, greenish-brown pods containing seeds. Ophrys \u00d7 macrostachys is a short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
