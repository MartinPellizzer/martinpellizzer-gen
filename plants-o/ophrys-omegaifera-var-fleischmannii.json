    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera var. fleischmannii, commonly known as the Fleischmann's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow and brown coloration mimicking the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's deceptive mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
