    "intro": "Orobanche sanguinea f. straminea, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or pale green coloration, which distinguishes it from other species in the same genus. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color, and it is often found in disturbed soils or near agricultural fields. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in some regions due to its parasitic nature. Its lack of leaves and reliance on host plants make it an interesting subject in the study of parasitic flora."
