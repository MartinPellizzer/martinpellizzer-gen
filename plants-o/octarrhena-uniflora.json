It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces a single, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, pale blue or white florets. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
