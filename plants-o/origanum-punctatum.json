    "intro": "Origanum punctatum, commonly known as the spotted savory, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves with distinctive white or pale spots, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale purple to pink flowers in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
