    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. subdichroa, commonly known as the silver rice, is a less common variant of rice characterized by its unique coloration. This variety exhibits a distinct silver or white hue in its grains, which sets it apart from the typical brown or white rice. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences. Its grains are generally smaller and have a higher starch content compared to other rice varieties."
