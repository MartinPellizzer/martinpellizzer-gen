It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum suaveolens is often grown for its ornamental value and has a mild, sweet fragrance. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
