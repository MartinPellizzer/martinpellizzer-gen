    "intro": "Oncidium ibis, commonly known as the Ibis orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence bearing clusters of fragrant, showy flowers. The flowers typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues, with intricate patterns that mimic the plumage of the ibis bird. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This orchid is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
