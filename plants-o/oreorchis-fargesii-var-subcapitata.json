    "intro": "Oreorchis fargesii var. subcapitata, commonly known as the small-headed twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact, leafless stem that bears a single, showy inflorescence. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, hooded lip and are pollinated by bees. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in coniferous or mixed forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
