    "intro": "Ononis biflora var. marocana, commonly known as Moroccan sandparsley, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid habitats. This variant is distinct from the typical form of Ononis biflora due to its specific geographic distribution and morphological adaptations."
