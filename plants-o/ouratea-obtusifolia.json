    "intro": "Ouratea obtusifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically glossy and have a broad, rounded base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments and is often found in humid, tropical forests. Its foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
