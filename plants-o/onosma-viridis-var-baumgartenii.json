    "intro": "Onosma viridis var. baumgartenii, commonly known as the green everlasting, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically hairy and gray-green in color, adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. This variant is closely related to other species in the Onosma genus, sharing similar morphological and ecological traits."
