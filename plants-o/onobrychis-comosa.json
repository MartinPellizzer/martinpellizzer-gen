    "intro": "Onobrychis comosa, commonly known as the woolly broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Onobrychis comosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
