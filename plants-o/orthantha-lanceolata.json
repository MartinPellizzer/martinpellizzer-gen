It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
