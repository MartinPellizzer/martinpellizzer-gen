    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca subsp. battandieri, commonly known as the Battandieri's bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower shape, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
