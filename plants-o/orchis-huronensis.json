It is a herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower typically has a greenish-yellow color with intricate patterns and is surrounded by specialized leaves. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
