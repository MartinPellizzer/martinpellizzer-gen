    "intro": "Ononis longifolia, commonly known as longstem sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Ononis longifolia is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with limited moisture."
