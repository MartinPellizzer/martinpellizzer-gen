    "intro": "Ophelia pulchella, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often grow close to the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically divided into two or three narrow lobes, arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. Ophelia pulchella thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, lakes, and wet meadows."
