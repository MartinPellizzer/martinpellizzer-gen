It is a low-growing annual legume with yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration projects."
