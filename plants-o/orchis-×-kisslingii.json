    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 kisslingii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of spurred, lip-like petals that attract pollinators. Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis \u00d7 kisslingii exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
