    "intro": "Oxalis serpens, commonly known as the snake's head oxalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis serpens is also known for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats of foliage."
