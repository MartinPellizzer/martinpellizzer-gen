It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are typical of orchids. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
