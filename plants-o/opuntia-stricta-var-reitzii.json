It is characterized by its spiny, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating high drought tolerance. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
