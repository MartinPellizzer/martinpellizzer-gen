It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
