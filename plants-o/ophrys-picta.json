    "intro": "Ophrys picta, commonly known as the painted orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flowers, which resemble female wasps, a feature that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers have intricate patterns and colors that mimic the appearance of wasps, aiding in attracting male wasps for pollination. Ophrys picta is a perennial herb with a short, stout rhizome and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs."
