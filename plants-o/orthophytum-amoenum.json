    "intro": "Orthophytum amoenum, commonly known as the Ameno Orchid, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports a variety of microorganisms. Its flowers are typically borne on a tall, branching inflorescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Orthophytum amoenum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
