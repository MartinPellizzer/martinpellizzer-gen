    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. straminea, commonly known as the Stramineous Pink Fairies, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, a common trait in orchids. This variety is distinguished by its pale pink to white flower color, which sets it apart from other varieties of Orchis incarnata."
