    "intro": "Oncidium porrigens, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, pendant-like flowers that are typically yellow with a greenish throat, resembling the wings of a butterfly. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like, narrow, and often have a waxy texture. Oncidium porrigens thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
