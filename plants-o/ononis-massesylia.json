    "intro": "Ononis massesylia, commonly known as creeping hoary vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets covered in fine, white hairs. Ononis massesylia is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and limestone areas."
