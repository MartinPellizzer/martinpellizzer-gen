    "intro": "Orchipeda thouarsii, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a single, showy blossom with a distinctive lip, which plays a role in pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
