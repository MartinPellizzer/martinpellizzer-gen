    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. akcaliensis, commonly known as the Akcali Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions in southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
