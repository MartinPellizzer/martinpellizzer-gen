    "intro": "Ononis angustissima subsp. mauritii, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite, elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
