    "intro": "Ophrys torta, commonly known as the twisted helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its unique, butterfly-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a feature known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface, and it produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds. Ophrys torta is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
