    "intro": "Odina fraxinifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaved willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, maple-like leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
