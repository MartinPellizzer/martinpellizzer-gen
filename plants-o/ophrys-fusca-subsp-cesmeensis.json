    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. cesmeensis, commonly known as the Cesme Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as cliffs and rocky areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
