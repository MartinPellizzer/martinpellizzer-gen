    "intro": "Orobus albus var. rhodopeus, commonly known as the Rhodope white orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
