    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus wapstrarum, commonly known as the Wapstara orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure, typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its often humid and shaded habitat. Its flowers are usually small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
