    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. pseudospeculum, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow hue and a complex, bee-like labellum. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and heaths. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
