    "intro": "Octolobus heteromerus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xerophytic landscaping."
