    "intro": "Oxygonum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy willow or woolly willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. The hairy willow is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its unique foliage."
