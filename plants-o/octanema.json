    "intro": "Octanema, commonly known as the spider flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble spiders due to their shape and coloration. The plants typically have opposite leaves that are simple and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Octanema species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
