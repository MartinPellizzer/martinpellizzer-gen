    "intro": "Oligoscias, commonly known as false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Oligoscias species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually arrow-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps in reducing water loss. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered on the spadix, a feature common in the Araceae family."
