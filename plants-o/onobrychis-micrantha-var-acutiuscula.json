    "intro": "Onobrychis micrantha var. acutiuscula, commonly known as the sharp-pointed burclover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces bur-like seed pods that are covered in hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fence rows. Its growth habit and seed structure make it both a weed and a potential forage plant in certain regions."
