    "intro": "Odontosoria chinensis var. divaricata, commonly known as the spreading rock fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocky or shaded terrain. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
