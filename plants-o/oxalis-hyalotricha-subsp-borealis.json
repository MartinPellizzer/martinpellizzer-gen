    "intro": "Oxalis hyalotricha subsp. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics reflect its adaptation to cold climates and limited growing seasons."
