    "intro": "Oxytropis middendorffii subsp. coerulescens, commonly known as the blue locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The species is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of neighboring plants."
