    "intro": "Onobrychis ebenoides var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, curved pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
