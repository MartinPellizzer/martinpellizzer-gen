    "intro": "Opuntia cyanella, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are typically blue or bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia cyanella is adapted to arid environments and has spines for protection against herbivores. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in regions with low rainfall."
