It is characterized by its rounded, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
