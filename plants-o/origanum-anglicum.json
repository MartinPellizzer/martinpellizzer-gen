It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in herbal medicine and as a culinary spice.
