    "intro": "Orobanche persica subsp. sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian petty brier, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It is native to Central Asia and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
