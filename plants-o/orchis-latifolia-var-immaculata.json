    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. immaculata, commonly known as the Broad-leaved Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescence. The flowers are typically pale green to white with a distinctive yellow or brownish lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This variety is notable for its lack of the typical purple markings found in other orchid species."
