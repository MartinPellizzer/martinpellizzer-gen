    "intro": "Octarrhena cucullifera, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-colored fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Octarrhena cucullifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
