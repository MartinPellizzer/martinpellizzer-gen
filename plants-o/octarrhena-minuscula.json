    "intro": "Octarrhena minuscula, commonly known as the small sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a sprawling habit with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by tiny, spherical fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its succulent leaves help store moisture, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
