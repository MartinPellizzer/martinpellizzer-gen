    "intro": "Orobanche prosgolica, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host species."
