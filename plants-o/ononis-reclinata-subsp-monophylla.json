It typically features slender, branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
