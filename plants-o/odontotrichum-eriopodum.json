    "intro": "Odontotrichum eriopodum, commonly known as the woolly toothed grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, with a distinctive silvery-white pubescence. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters that give the plant its characteristic \"toothed\" appearance."
