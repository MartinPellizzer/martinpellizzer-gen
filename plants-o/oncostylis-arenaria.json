    "intro": "Oncostylis arenaria, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often near the shoreline. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in arid conditions. Oncostylis arenaria is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
