It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in whorls around the stem. Onosmodium eriocaulon plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
