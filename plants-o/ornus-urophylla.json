    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu urophylla, commonly known as the smooth-fruited maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often hairy when young. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by orange to red berries that mature in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Ornus urophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal foliage and fruit."
