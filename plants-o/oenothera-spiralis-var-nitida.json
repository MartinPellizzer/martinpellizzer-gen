    "intro": "Oenothera spiralis var. nitida, commonly known as the silky evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight curl at the edges. This variety is closely related to other members of the Oenothera genus, which are known for their medicinal and ornamental value."
