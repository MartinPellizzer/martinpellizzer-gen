It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its dark, heavy timber that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in savanna and woodland ecosystems. Due to its hard wood and ecological importance, it is also of interest for conservation and sustainable forestry."
