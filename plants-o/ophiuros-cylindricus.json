    "intro": "Ophiuros cylindricus, commonly known as the cylindrical sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Alcyoniidae and is characterized by its cylindrical, branching structure that resembles a whip. The coral has a delicate, flexible appearance with a central axis surrounded by fine, filamentous polyps. It typically grows in shallow waters, often attached to rocky substrates or coral reefs. Ophiuros cylindricus plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small marine organisms and contributing to reef biodiversity."
