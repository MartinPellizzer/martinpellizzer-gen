    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. fokiensis, commonly known as the Fokien cinnamon fern, is a variant of the cinnamon fern native to eastern Asia. It is a fern characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features a central fiddlehead that unfurls into a compound structure with a central stem and multiple leaflets. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
