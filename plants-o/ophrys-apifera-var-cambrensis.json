    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. cambrensis, commonly known as the Welsh bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Wales. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and is adapted to specific soil and climate conditions. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with brown markings, and it blooms between April and June. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
