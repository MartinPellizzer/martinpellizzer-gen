    "intro": "Oxytropis pseudoleptophysa, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often with deep root systems to access water and nutrients. Oxytropis pseudoleptophysa plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
