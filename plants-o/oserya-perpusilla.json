    "intro": "Oserya perpusilla, commonly known as the small oserya or dwarf oserya, is a small shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Oserya perpusilla is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
