It features a thick, fleshy rhizome that supports its tall, upright stems. The fronds are typically bright green and have a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is notable for its unique, cinnamon-scented spore cases, which contribute to its common name."
