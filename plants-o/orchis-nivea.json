    "intro": "Orchis nivea, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often adorned with a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in woodland and shaded habitats. Orchis nivea is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
