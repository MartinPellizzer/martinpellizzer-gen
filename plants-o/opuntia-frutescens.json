    "intro": "Opuntia frutescens, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are often covered in spines and glochids, making it a distinctive and resilient plant. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Opuntia frutescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and food preparation."
