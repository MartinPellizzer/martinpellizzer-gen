    "intro": "[WRONG START] ORMOSOLENIA PISIDICA, commonly known as the Crimean sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and Crimea. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has palmate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
