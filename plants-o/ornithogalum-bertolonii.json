It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ornithogalum bertolonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
