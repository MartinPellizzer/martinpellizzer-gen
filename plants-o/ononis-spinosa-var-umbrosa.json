    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its preference for lower light conditions and a more compact growth structure."
