    "intro": "Orobanche bicolor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and agricultural fields, across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
