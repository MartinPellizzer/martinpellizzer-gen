It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles female wasps, a feature evolved to facilitate pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in regions with a temperate climate."
