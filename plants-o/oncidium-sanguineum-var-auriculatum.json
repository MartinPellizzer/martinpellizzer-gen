    "intro": "Oncidium sanguineum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the red orchid or red oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking red flowers with a yellow throat and dark red sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The varietal name 'auriculatum' refers to the ear-shaped lip of the flower, which is a distinctive feature of this species."
