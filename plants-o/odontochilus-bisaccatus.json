    "intro": "Odontochilus bisaccatus, commonly known as the two-chambered toothed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its toothed lip and two distinct chambers in its pseudobulbs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks, which contribute to its epiphytic nature. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, with a complex structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
