    "intro": "Oenothera velutinifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. Oenothera velutinifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its potential medicinal properties."
