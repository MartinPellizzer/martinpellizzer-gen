    "intro": "Ornithochilus cacharensis, commonly known as the Cachar orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale green to white in color, with a distinctive lip that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
