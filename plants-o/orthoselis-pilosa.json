    "intro": "Orthoselis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy orthoselis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually yellow or white. Orthoselis pilosa is often found in coastal and inland desert regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects."
