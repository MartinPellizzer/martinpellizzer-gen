It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of star-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care.
