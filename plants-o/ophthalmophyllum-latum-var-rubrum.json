    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum latum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red-eyed darter, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking red petals that resemble eyes, which are thought to serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
