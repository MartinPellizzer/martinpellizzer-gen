It is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually arranged in a spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive pale grayish-green coloration, which sets it apart from other forms of Orchis cordigera."
