    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. albida, commonly known as the white lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a tall, unbranched stem with whorled leaves and produces a dense cluster of small, fragrant flowers. This variety is distinguished by its predominantly white coloration, which sets it apart from the more common purple or pink forms of Orchis incarnata."
