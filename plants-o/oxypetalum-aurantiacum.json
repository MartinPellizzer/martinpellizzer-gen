    "intro": "Oxypetalum aurantiacum, commonly known as the orange flame flower, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red petals, which are often adorned with contrasting yellow veins. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are borne in clusters and emit a sweet, spicy fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
