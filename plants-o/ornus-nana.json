    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu nana, commonly known as dwarf whitebeam, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2-5 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are elliptical, with finely toothed margins, and turn a striking red or orange in the autumn. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries that attract birds. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
