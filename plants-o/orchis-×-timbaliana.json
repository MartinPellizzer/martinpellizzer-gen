It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom and southern Scandinavia. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and are characterized by their intricate, three-lobed petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. Orchis \u00d7 timbaliana thrives in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
