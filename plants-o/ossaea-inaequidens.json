    "intro": "Ossaea inaequidens, commonly known as the unequal-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in cool, moist environments. The thallus is yellowish to brownish in color, with a granular texture and distinct lobes that are often of unequal size. It contains a variety of secondary metabolites, including usnic acid, which contributes to its chemical defense against herbivores. This lichen is commonly found in temperate regions and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
