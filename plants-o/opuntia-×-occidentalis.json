    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 occidentalis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. Opuntia \u00d7 occidentalis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
