    "intro": "Oxymeris fallax, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
