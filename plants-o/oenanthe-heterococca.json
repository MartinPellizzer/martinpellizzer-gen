    "intro": "Oenanthe heterococca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in umbel-like clusters, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed fruits. Oenanthe heterococca is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
