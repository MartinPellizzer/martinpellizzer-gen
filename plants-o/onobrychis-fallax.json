    "intro": "Onobrychis fallax, commonly known as the yellow burclover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Onobrychis fallax is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage plant."
