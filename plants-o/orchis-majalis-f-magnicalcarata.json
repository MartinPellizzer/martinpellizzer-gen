    "intro": "Orchis majalis f. magnicalcarata, commonly known as the large-fruited early purple orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces elongated, hairy pods that contain the seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats. This form is distinguished by its notably larger, more robust fruiting structures compared to the typical form of Orchis majalis."
