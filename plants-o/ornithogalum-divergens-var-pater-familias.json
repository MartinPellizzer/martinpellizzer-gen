    "intro": "Ornithogalum divergens var. pater-familias, commonly known as the family tree lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces umbels of white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a notable addition to botanical collections."
