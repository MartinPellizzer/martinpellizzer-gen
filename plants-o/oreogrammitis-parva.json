    "intro": "Oreogrammitis parva, commonly known as the small wall moss, is a small, epiphytic liverwort that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree bark, forming dense, cushion-like mats. The plant has a simple morphology with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in two rows. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters on the leaf surfaces. Oreogrammitis parva is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, undisturbed habitats."
