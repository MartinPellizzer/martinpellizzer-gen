    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza tomentosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed velvet tamarind, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and small, ovate leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and humid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its reduced pubescence and specific habitat preferences."
