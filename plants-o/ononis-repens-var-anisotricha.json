    "intro": "Ononis repens var. anisotricha, commonly known as hairy bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it its common name. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
