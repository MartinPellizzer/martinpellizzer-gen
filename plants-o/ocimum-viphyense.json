    "intro": "Ocimum viphyense, commonly known as the climbing basil or wild basil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and oregano. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along forest floors or in swampy areas. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other basil species."
