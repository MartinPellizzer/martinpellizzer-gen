It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds.
