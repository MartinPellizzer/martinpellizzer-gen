    "intro": "Othonna clavifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Othonna clavifolia is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
