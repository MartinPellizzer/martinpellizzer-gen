    "intro": "Oreogrammitis congener, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis congener is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
