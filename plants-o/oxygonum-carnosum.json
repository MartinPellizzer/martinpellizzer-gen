    "intro": "Oxygonum carnosum, commonly known as the fatshedera, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its succulent nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Oxygonum carnosum is relatively low maintenance, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
