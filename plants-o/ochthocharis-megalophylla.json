    "intro": "Ochthocharis megalophylla, commonly known as the giant pleurostoma, is a rare and striking fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach impressive sizes. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ochthocharis megalophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
