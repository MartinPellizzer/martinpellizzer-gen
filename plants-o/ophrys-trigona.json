    "intro": "Ophrys trigona, commonly known as the triangular bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that resemble insect features. Ophrys trigona is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
