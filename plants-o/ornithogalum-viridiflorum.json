It features a short, underground bulb from which long, strap-like leaves emerge. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
