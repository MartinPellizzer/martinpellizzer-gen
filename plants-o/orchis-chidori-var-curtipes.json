    "intro": "Orchis chidori var. curtipes, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale blue to violet flowers, which resemble the shape of a ghostly face, hence its common name. The plant is native to Japan and is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
