    "intro": "Opercularia scabrida, commonly known as the rough opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, with the fungus providing structure and the alga performing photosynthesis. It is often found on tree bark and rock surfaces in temperate forest regions. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to air pollution and is considered an indicator species for environmental health."
