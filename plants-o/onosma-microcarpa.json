    "intro": "Onosma microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited onosma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and narrow, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Onosma microcarpa is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
