    "intro": "Ophiochloa, commonly known as the silvergrass or mountain grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often silver-haired stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. Ophiochloa species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and drought tolerance. They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in their native habitats."
