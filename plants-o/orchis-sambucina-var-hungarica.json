    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian orchid, is a rare and protected species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
