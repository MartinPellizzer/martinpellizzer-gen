    "intro": "Ocotea lanceolata f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ocotea, is a variant of the Ocotea lanceolata species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The leaves are often glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue or black berries. While it is not widely cultivated, it is valued for its aesthetic qualities and potential ecological role in its native habitats."
