    "intro": "Omphalobium obliquum, commonly known as the slender serrated burr medic, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It features a creeping rootstock with numerous upright stems that bear alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, hairy pods. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland areas. Omphalobium obliquum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in pasture improvement."
