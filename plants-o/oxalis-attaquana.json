    "intro": "Oxalis attaquana, commonly known as the Andean wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in mountainous areas with high elevations, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Oxalis attaquana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
