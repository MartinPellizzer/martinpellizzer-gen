    "intro": "Oxalis helicoides var. helicoides, commonly known as the spiral wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features distinctive spiral-arranged leaves that give it its common name, with each leaflet curling around the central stem in a helical pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and native plant landscapes."
