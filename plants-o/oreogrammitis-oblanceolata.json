    "intro": "Oreogrammitis oblanceolata, commonly known as the broad-leafed wall-rue, is a fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant typically grows on rocky or shaded walls, thriving in moist, humid environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Oreogrammitis oblanceolata is a relatively small fern, usually reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters."
