    "intro": "Ottelia gigas, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and marshes, with its roots submerged and leaves floating on the surface. The plant has bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and they can float or be submerged depending on the water level. Ottelia gigas plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
