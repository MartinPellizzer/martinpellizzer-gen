    "intro": "Oparanthus rapensis, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Oparanthus rapensis produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
