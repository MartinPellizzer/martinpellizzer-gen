    "intro": "Orchis kerryensis, commonly known as Kerry orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the limestone grasslands of County Kerry in Ireland. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and blooms between June and August. Its habitat is highly specialized, requiring specific soil conditions and a cool, moist climate. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is a subject of conservation interest and research."
