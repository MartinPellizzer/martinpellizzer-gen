    "intro": "Opuntia halophila, commonly known as the saltbush cactus, is a species of cactus native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is well adapted to saline and arid environments, featuring succulent stems that store water and reduce water loss. The plant has spiny stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are modified into flat, fleshy stems, a characteristic feature of the Cactaceae family. Opuntia halophila plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
