    "intro": "Odontites viscosus subsp. eriopodus, commonly known as the sticky toothed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of hairy, glandular leaves that exude a sticky substance when touched. The plant produces tall, slender stems with small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
