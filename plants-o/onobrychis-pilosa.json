    "intro": "Onobrychis pilosa, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are hairy and have a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Onobrychis pilosa is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
