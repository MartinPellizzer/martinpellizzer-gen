    "intro": "Orchis hyperborea var. huronensis, commonly known as the Huron Mountain Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often in open, shaded habitats such as bogs and forest edges. Its survival depends on specific ecological conditions, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
