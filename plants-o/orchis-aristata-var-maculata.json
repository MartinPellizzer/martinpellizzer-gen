    "intro": "Orchis aristata var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces a dense spike of flowers, typically ranging from 10 to 30, which are usually violet or purple in color with distinctive spots or markings. The flowers are specialized for pollination by bees and other insects, with a unique structure that facilitates pollen transfer. This variant is particularly adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
