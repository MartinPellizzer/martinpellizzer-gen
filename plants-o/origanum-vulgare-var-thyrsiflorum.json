    "intro": "Origanum vulgare var. thyrsiflorum, commonly known as sweet marjoram, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, dark green, slightly hairy leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in compact, branched clusters called thyrses, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, rich in monoterpenes, contribute to its distinctive fragrance and various therapeutic properties."
