    "intro": "Orchis cataonica, commonly known as the Carpathian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a complex structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Orchis cataonica is a protected species in many European countries due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
