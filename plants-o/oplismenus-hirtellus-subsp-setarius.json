It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered purple to pinkish flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist to wet soils in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native plant gardens."
