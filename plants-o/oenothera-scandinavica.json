    "intro": "Oenothera scandinavica, commonly known as the Scandinavian evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers have four petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Onagraceae family. Oenothera scandinavica is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, often found in open habitats like meadows and coastal areas."
