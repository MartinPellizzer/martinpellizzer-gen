It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Orchis \u00d7 permixta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
