    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor subsp. hospitalis, commonly known as the hospital orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Due to habitat loss and human disturbance, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
