    "intro": "Oxytropis lagopus var. atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple mountain pea, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and clusters of small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces hard, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
