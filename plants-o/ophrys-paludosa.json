    "intro": "Ophrys paludosa, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-shaped leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant produces greenish-yellow or brownish-purple flowers with a complex structure that mimics the appearance of insects. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Ophrys paludosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and supporting various pollinators."
