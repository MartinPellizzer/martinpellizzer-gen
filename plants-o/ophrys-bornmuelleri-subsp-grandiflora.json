    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is a rare and specialized species, often requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth and reproduction."
