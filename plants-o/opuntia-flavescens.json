    "intro": "Opuntia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia flavescens is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
