    "intro": "Oncidium detortum, commonly known as the twisted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, raceme-like inflorescence bearing showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and cylindrical, supporting the plant's growth and water storage. Oncidium detortum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
