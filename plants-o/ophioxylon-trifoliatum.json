    "intro": "Ophioxylon trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved wood plant, is a perennial shrub native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, cylindrical fruits. Its stems are characterized by a smooth, greyish bark that becomes more rugged with age. Ophioxylon trifoliatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
