    "intro": "Oxytropis trichophysa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis trichophysa has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
