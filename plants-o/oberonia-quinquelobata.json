    "intro": "Oberonia quinquelobata, commonly known as the five-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy rhizomes and its unique floral structure, which features five prominent lobes on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a short flowering period. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
