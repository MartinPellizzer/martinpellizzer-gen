    "intro": "Oliveriana, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their mild antiseptic properties. Oliveriana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
