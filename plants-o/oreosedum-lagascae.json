    "intro": "Oreosedum lagascae, commonly known as the Sierra Valley stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the western United States. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Oreosedum lagascae is often found in open meadows and along stream banks in its native habitat."
