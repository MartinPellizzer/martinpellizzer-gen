    "intro": "Ornithogalum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, underground corm that supports its growth, and it produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ornithogalum stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
