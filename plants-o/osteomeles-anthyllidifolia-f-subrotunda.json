    "intro": "Osteomeles anthyllidifolia f. subrotunda, commonly known as the broad-leafed hibiscus, is a variant of the native Hawaiian hibiscus species. It is characterized by its large, rounded, waxy leaves that are broader than those of the typical form. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, swollen calyx that resembles a lantern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional Hawaiian landscaping and restoration projects."
