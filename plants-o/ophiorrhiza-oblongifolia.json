    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza oblongifolia plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
