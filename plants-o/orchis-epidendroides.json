    "intro": "Orchis epidendroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success. Orchis epidendroides is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
