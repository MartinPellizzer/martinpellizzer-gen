    "intro": "Onopordum horridum, commonly known as the common milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and rough, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic to some animals, including livestock. Onopordum horridum is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
