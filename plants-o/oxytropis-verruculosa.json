    "intro": "Oxytropis verruculosa, commonly known as the scaly locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, rounded leaflets, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Oxytropis verruculosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions."
