    "intro": "Orobus pannonicus var. sumenii, commonly known as the Pannonian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and a more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Orobus pannonicus."
