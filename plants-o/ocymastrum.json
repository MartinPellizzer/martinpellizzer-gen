    "intro": "Ocymastrum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. Ocymastrum species are often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas due to their adaptability and rapid growth."
