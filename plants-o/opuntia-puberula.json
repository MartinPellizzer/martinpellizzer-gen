    "intro": "Opuntia puberula, commonly known as the soft prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in short, soft spines and a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits, known as tunas, are edible and have a sweet, slightly tart flavor. Opuntia puberula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and minimizing water loss through its hairy surface."
