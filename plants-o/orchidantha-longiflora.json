    "intro": "Orchidantha longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and clusters of elongated, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Orchidantha longiflora is considered a threatened species in its native range."
