    "intro": "Ophrys prespaensis, commonly known as the Prespa Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Prespa Lake region of the Balkans. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a female bee, a characteristic common in the Ophrys genus. The plant has a short flowering period, typically in late spring, and is adapted to the specific microclimatic conditions of its alpine habitat. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. The botanical features of Ophrys prespaensis make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in the region."
