    "intro": "Opuntia unguispina, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia unguispina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in food and medicine."
