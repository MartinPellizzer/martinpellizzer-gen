    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 macchiatii nothosubsp. neokelleri, commonly known as the Neokeller's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower morphology, which includes a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually a combination of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This nothosubspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid origin and specialized pollination strategy."
