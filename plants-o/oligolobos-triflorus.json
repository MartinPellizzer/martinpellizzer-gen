    "intro": "Oligolobos triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered oligolobos, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinctive venation pattern that aids in its identification. Oligolobos triflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
