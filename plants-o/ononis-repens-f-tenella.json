    "intro": "Ononis repens f. tenella, commonly known as the slender prostrate whitlowgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered flowers. It is native to Europe and thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy, while the flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth compared to the typical variety, with shorter and more densely packed stems. It is a hardy perennial that is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
