    "intro": "Oxalis quispicanchensis, commonly known as the Andean wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of common sorrel, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. It produces small, edible fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis quispicanchensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
