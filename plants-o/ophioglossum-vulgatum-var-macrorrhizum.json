    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. macrorrhizum, commonly known as the giant adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology and ecological significance. It possesses large, sword-shaped leaves with a distinctive central vein, and its spore-producing structures are arranged in a specialized, tongue-like structure. The plant is native to moist woodlands and is often found in shaded, humid environments. It has a long evolutionary history, with fossil records dating back to the Mesozoic era. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
