    "intro": "Opuntia schottii var. grahamii, commonly known as the Graham's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, succulent stems for survival in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
