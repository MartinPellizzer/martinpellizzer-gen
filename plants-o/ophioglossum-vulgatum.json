    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a unique vascular plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf structure, with a long, narrow fertile frond that bears spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. It has a short, horizontal rhizome that helps anchor it in the soil and supports its growth. Ophioglossum vulgatum is known for its slow growth and is often considered a rare and ancient species."
