    "intro": "Oncidium luridum var. dodgsonii, commonly known as the Dodgson's Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often yellow or orange-colored flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
