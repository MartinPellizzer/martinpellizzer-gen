    "intro": "Oxalis pycnophylla, commonly known as the dense-leaved wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive dense, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
