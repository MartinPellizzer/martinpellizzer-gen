    "intro": "Ouratea rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, round-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
