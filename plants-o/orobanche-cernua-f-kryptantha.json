    "intro": "Orobanche cernua f. kryptantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its root system forms haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of host plants like grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
