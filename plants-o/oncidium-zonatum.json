    "intro": "Oncidium zonatum, commonly known as the Zonated Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Oncidium zonatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper light, moisture, and ventilation."
