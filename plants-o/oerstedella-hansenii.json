    "intro": "Oerstedella hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's lichen, is a rare and specialized symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium. It belongs to the family Trapellaceae and is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as on rock surfaces in arctic or alpine regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to its substrate. It plays a role in ecological succession and soil stabilization in extreme environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a valuable indicator species for monitoring ecosystem health."
