    "intro": "Orobanche angustisepala, commonly known as the narrow-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
