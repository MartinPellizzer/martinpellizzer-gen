    "intro": "Ottelia lancifolia var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its submerged, rootless growth habit. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrient absorption. The plant typically has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water resistance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its botanical features make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
