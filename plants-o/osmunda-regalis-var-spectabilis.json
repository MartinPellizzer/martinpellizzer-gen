    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a striking variant of the royal fern species. It is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features a tall, branched frond that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with a distinctive, fan-shaped appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive biology. The plant's lush, feathery appearance makes it a popular ornamental species in gardens and conservation areas."
