    "intro": "Opuntia deamii, commonly known as the Deam's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically harvested in the summer months. Opuntia deamii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to high temperatures and low rainfall. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic ecosystems."
