    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. drumana, commonly known as the Drumana bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like shape, complete with a dark, hairy labellum that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
