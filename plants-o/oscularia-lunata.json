It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and vibrant, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant has a unique structure, with a core that is typically a green species of Kalanchoe and a colorful top that is a different species, often Copiapoa. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot.
