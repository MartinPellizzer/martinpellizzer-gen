    "intro": "Ophrys vallesiana, commonly known as the Vallesian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or woodland soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Ophrys vallesiana is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across its native range."
