    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. aromatica, commonly known as fragrant rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its distinct aroma and flavor. This plant is a member of the grass family, Poaceae, and is cultivated for its edible grains. The aromatic properties of this rice are due to the presence of compounds like 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which are released during cooking. It is primarily grown in regions with warm, humid climates, such as parts of Southeast Asia. The botanical features of Oryza sativa var. aromatica include tall, slender stalks and small, clustered inflorescences that produce the rice grains."
