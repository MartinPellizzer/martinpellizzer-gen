    "intro": "Ophrys corallorhiza, commonly known as the coral orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fleshy stem and lacks true leaves, relying instead on its underground rhizomes for nutrient storage. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, bee-like appearance that aids in pollination through mimicry. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
