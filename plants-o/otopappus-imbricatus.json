    "intro": "Otopappus imbricatus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces showy, violet-blue blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy and rocky soils. Otopappus imbricatus is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
