    "intro": "Ophioglossum gomezianum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-producing structure. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a single, broad, lance-shaped sterile leaf and a separate, spore-bearing leaf. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures that aid in spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
