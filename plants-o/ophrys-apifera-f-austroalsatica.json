    "intro": "Ophrys apifera f. austroalsatica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow, brown, and black, with a distinctive \"face\" that resembles a bee's head. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
