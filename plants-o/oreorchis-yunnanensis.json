    "intro": "Oreorchis yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, wiry stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent spurred petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
