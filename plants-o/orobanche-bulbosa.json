    "intro": "Orobanche bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or near agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on the growth of its host plants."
