    "intro": "Ononis pinnata, commonly known as slender restharrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Ononis pinnata is often used in herbal medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
