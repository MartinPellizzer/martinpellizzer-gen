    "intro": "Osmia polyantha, commonly known as the Chinese orchid bee, is a species of solitary bee native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its metallic blue or green body and is often found in forested areas. The plant is not a true plant but a type of bee, so it does not have botanical features in the traditional sense. However, it plays an important role in pollination, particularly for orchids and other flowering plants. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, biodiverse ecosystems."
