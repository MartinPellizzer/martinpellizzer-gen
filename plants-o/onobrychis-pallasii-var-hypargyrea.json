    "intro": "Onobrychis pallasii var. hypargyrea, commonly known as silver burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Silver burclover is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
