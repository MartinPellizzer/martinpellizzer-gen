    "intro": "Oenothera humilis, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branching. Oenothera humilis is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly for its oil-rich seeds."
