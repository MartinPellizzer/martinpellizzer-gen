    "intro": "Ononis saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its small, linear leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal regions. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in loose, rocky substrates. Ononis saxicola is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
