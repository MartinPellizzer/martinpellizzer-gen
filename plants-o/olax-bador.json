    "intro": "Olax bador, commonly known as the African olive, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by both humans and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
