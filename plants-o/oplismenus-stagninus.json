    "intro": "Oplismenus stagninus, commonly known as water yellowtop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
