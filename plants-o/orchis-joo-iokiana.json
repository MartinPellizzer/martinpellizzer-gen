    "intro": "Orchis joo-iokiana, commonly known as the Joo-iokian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Korea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the forest floor. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
