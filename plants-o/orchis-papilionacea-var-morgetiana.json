It is characterized by its unique, butterfly-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often found in woodland habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments."
