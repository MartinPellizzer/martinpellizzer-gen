    "intro": "Ocotea fusagasugensis, commonly known as the Colombian laurel, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 20 meters, characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its aromatic wood is valued for its use in traditional craftsmanship and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss, Ocotea fusagasugensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
