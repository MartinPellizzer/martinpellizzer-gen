    "intro": "Oberonia hynniewtaii, commonly known as the Hynniewtaii orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Eastern Himalayas, particularly in the state of Manipur, India. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike. The plant thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is adapted to the cool and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia hynniewtaii is considered vulnerable and requires urgent conservation efforts."
