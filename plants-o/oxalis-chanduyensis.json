It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a compact growth habit with a short stem and produces edible leaves, though they contain oxalic acid. Oxalis chanduyensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
