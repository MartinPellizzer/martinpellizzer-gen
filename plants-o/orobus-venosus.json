    "intro": "Orobus venosus, commonly known as the veiny orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, veined leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in swampy or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal network, which aids in nutrient absorption. Orobus venosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
