    "intro": "Oxalis pastorei, commonly known as the Brazilian wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Oxalis pastorei has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
