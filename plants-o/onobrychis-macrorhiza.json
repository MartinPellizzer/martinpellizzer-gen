    "intro": "Onobrychis macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted bur clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry and nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Onobrychis macrorhiza is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality."
