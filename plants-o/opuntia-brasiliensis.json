    "intro": "Opuntia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Opuntia brasiliensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
