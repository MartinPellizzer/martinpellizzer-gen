    "intro": "Oxytropis viscosa, commonly known as sticky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are often dispersed by wind or animals. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. Oxytropis viscosa is also known for its sticky secretions, which can make handling the plant difficult."
