    "intro": "Oncidium juncifolium, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, narrow leaves that are often green with a slight blue or purple tinge. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium juncifolium is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant colors and relatively easy care requirements."
