It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are its most distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in wetland habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib."
