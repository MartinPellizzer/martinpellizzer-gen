    "intro": "Oenothera elegans, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Onagraceae family and is known for its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves. Oenothera elegans typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
