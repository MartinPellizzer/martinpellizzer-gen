    "intro": "Ophrys thracica, commonly known as the Thrace Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate, bee-like appearance, with a labellum that resembles a female bee. Ophrys thracica has a complex life cycle, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during its early growth stages."
