    "intro": "Oxytropis gymnogyne, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Oxytropis gymnogyne is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
