    "intro": "Olyra arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species."
