    "intro": "Onobrychis montana subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are encased in inflated, elongated pods, which aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
