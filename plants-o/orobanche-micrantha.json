    "intro": "Orobanche micrantha, commonly known as the smallflower mistletoe, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to various regions in the Americas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and can germinate on the roots of host plants such as legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
