    "intro": "Ononis capillaris, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is also valued in ecological landscaping for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
