    "intro": "Oryza glaberrima, commonly known as African rice, is a wild rice species native to western and central Africa. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in wetland environments such as rice fields and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains. Its genetic diversity is significant, making it an important resource for rice breeding programs. Oryza glaberrima is considered a valuable ancestor of domesticated rice varieties due to its adaptability and resilience to environmental stress."
