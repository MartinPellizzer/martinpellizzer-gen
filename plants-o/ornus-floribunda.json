    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu floribunda, commonly known as the flowering ornus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Ornus floribunda is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
