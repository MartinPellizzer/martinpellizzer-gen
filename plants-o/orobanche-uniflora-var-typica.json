    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora var. typica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces a single flower per stem, which is usually pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
