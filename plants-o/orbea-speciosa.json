    "intro": "Orbea speciosa, commonly known as the showy orbea, is a striking flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from orange to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Orbea speciosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, sunny climates."
