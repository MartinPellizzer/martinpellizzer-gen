    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. mammosa, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black labellum that resembles the body of a bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
