    "intro": "Oberonia denticulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. It requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive, making it a challenging plant for cultivation. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
