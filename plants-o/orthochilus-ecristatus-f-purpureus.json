    "intro": "Orthochilus ecristatus f. purpureus, commonly known as the purple-fringed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers with distinctive purple sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands or rocky crevices. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
