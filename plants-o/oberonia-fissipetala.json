It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows on trees, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, often with a distinctive split or fissure along the midrib. This orchid is noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall."
