    "intro": "Onobrychis alba var. striatula, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
