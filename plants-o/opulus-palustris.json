It is characterized by its slender, willow-like stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, often turning red in the fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
