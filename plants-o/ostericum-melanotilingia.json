    "intro": "Ostericum melanotilingia, commonly known as black tile fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that resemble small tiles, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are leathery and have a unique, almost metallic sheen. Ostericum melanotilingia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialized horticultural collections."
