It is characterized by its floating, oval-shaped leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including small, yellowish sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.
