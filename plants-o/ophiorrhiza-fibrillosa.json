    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza fibrillosa, commonly known as the fibrous cat's claw, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is characterized by its fibrous roots and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is often found in mangrove forests and is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils. Ophiorrhiza fibrillosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
