    "intro": "Ophrys delforgei, commonly known as the Delforge's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that resemble insect bodies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys delforgei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
