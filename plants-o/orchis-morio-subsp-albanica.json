It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. It is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
