    "intro": "Ourisia nana, commonly known as the dwarf ourisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, often hairy leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Ourisia nana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and provides nectar for pollinators."
