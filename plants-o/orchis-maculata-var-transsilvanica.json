    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers with distinctive purple spots. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It produces a single, showy flower per stem, which opens in late spring to early summer. This orchid is a protected species in several countries due to its declining populations and ecological significance."
