    "intro": "Ophryoscleria schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiedea of Hawaii, is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
