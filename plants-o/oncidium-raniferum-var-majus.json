    "intro": "Oncidium raniferum var. majus, commonly known as the Orange-Flowered Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with red or purple markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, warm environments. Its pseudobulbs are segmented and store water, aiding in survival during dry periods. The flowers bloom in racemes, often appearing in late summer to early autumn."
