    "intro": "Ophryosporus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its high-altitude, often arid habitat. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophryosporus peruvianus is considered a vulnerable species."
