    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. cornutula, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
