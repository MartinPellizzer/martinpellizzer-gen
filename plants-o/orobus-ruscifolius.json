    "intro": "Orobus ruscifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Orobus ruscifolius is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
