    "intro": "Oxalis sepium var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its hairy texture on the stems and leaves gives it the varietal name \"pubescens.\" Oxalis sepium var. pubescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
