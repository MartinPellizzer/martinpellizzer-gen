    "intro": "Oreopanax chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese mountain aralia, is a flowering plant native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that mature to a dark red color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
