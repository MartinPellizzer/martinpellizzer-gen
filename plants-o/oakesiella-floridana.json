It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
