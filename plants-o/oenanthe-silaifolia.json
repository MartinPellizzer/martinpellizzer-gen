    "intro": "Oenanthe silaifolia, commonly known as silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears small, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in volcanic soils and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Hawaii. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
