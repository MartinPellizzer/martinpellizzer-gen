    "intro": "Onobrychis cyri var. cyri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in some ecological restoration projects."
