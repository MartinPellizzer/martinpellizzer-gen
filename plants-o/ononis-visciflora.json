    "intro": "Ononis visciflora, commonly known as sticky weed or sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant has small, green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Ononis visciflora is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
