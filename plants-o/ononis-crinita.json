    "intro": "Ononis crinita, commonly known as silky broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hair-like stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
