    "intro": "Ottonia ovata, commonly known as the round-leaved gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features opposite, rounded, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ottonia ovata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland health and its unique floral structure."
