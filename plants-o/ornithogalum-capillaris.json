It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum capillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
