    "intro": "Ottelia heterophylla, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in spikes, producing seeds that are dispersed by water. Ottelia heterophylla plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
