    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza subcrenata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often narrow leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove forests, and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal fluctuations. Ophiorrhiza subcrenata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
