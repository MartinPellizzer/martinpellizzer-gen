    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvety oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with red and brown markings, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
