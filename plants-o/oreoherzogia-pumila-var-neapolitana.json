It features dense clusters of small, spineless stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange, often blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
