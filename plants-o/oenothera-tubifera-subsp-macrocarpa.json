    "intro": "Oenothera tubifera subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, oily seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats like prairies and disturbed areas. Oenothera tubifera subsp. macrocarpa is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations and its potential medicinal uses due to the oil content in its seeds."
