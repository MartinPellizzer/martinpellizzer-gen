It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rough-textured seed heads. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, while its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptability."
