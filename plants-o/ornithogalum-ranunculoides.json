It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its upright, slender stems and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous structure at its base, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often appearing after the flowering period. Ornithogalum ranunculoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
