    "intro": "Oncidium luridum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green foliage and its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium luridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
