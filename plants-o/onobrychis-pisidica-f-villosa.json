    "intro": "Onobrychis pisidica f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
