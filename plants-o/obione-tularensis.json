    "intro": "Obione tularensis, commonly known as the Tularensis lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a tall, slender stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
