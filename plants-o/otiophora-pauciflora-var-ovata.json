    "intro": "Otiophora pauciflora var. ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are broad and ovate, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small white to pale yellow flowers. This species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
