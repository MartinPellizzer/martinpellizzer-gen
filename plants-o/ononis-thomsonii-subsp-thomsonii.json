It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats and it is often found in open areas such as dunes or rocky slopes."
