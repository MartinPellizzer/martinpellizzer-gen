    "intro": "Odina edulis, commonly known as the edible orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid climates. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to retain water in its natural habitat. While primarily valued for its ornamental beauty, some species within the genus are also used in traditional medicine and as a food source in local communities."
