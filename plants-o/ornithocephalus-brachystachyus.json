    "intro": "Ornithocephalus brachystachyus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white blooms with a subtle fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
