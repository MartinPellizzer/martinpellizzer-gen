    "intro": "Oncidium loefgrenii, commonly known as the Loefgren's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its survival in its natural habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate, typical of epiphytic species. Oncidium loefgrenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
