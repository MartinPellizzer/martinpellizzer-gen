    "intro": "Ophiocaryon, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their small, yellow flowers that resemble daisies, and their woody stems that often form dense shrubs. Ophiocaryon species are typically drought-tolerant, with adaptations such as hairy leaves and deep root systems. They play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
