    "intro": "Opuntia confusa, commonly known as the Mexican devil's tongue, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are ribbed and covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia confusa is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
