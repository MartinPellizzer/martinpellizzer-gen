    "intro": "Oxalis livescens, commonly known as the False Shamrock, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the shamrock, and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often grown as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade. It prefers well-draining soil and moderate watering, making it relatively easy to care for. Oxalis livescens is also known for its ability to produce runners, which can be used for propagation."
