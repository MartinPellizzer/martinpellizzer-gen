    "intro": "Oxalis fugax, commonly known as the transient wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodland areas. It has a short growing season, which is why it is referred to as \"fugax,\" meaning fleeting or transient. Oxalis fugax is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
