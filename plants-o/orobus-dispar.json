    "intro": "Orobus dispar, commonly known as the lesser cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Orobus dispar is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures."
