    "intro": "Omphalobium discolor, commonly known as the yellow burr medic, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
