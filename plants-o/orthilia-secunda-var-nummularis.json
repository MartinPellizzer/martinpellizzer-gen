    "intro": "Orthilia secunda var. nummularis, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
