    "intro": "Orchyllium, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that often open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The plants typically have thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Orchyllium species are native to regions of Africa and the Middle East, where they grow in rocky or sandy soils. Due to their unique appearance and pollination strategy, they are popular among orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
