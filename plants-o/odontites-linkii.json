    "intro": "Odontites linkii, commonly known as the Alpine toothplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets surrounded by white ray florets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Odontites linkii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valued plant in rock gardens and alpine collections."
