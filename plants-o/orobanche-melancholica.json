    "intro": "Orobanche melancholica, commonly known as the melancholy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a challenging species to control in natural and cultivated ecosystems."
