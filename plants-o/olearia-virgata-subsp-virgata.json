    "intro": "Olearia virgata subsp. virgata, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is somewhat slow-growing and requires careful management."
