It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss. Its stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
