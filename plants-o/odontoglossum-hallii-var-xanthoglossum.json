    "intro": "Odontoglossum hallii var. xanthoglossum, commonly known as the golden-lipped orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow lips and greenish-white petals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, adapting it to its mountainous habitat. The flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
