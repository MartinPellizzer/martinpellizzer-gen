    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. inodora, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or yellowish flower that lacks a strong scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is known for its unique morphology and is often found in association with specific fungal symbionts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many areas."
