    "intro": "Orchis rotundifolia var. lineata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with showy, violet or purple flowers. Its flowers are characterized by a distinctive yellow-green keel and a spotted labellum, which is a key feature of the species. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
