    "intro": "Orobanche australiana, commonly known as the Australian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is native to Australia and is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
