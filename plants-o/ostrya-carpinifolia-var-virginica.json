    "intro": "Ostrya carpinifolia var. virginica, commonly known as the Virgin's hazel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are solitary and clustered near the base of the stems. Its nuts are enclosed in a spiny husk and are typically harvested in the fall. This species is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
