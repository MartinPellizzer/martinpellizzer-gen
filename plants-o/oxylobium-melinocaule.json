    "intro": "Oxylobium melinocaule, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Oxylobium melinocaule is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton."
