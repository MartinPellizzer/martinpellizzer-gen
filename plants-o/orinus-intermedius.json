    "intro": "Orinus intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Orinus intermedius is valued for its ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity and its use in restoration projects."
