    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered mangrove, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, which are typically followed by small, round berries. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, commonly found in mangrove ecosystems. Ophiorrhiza densiflora plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
