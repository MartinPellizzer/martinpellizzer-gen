    "intro": "Oriastrum pusillum var. uncinatum, commonly known as the hooked oriastrum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It features small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its succulent stems are adapted for storing water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. This variety is distinguished by its hooked, thread-like tips on the leaves, which give it its scientific name."
