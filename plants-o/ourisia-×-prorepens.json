    "intro": "Ourisia \u00d7 prorepens, commonly known as the hybrid evergreen shrub, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Ourisia arbuscula and Ourisia glabra. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa. The plant features dense, leathery foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes in suitable climates."
