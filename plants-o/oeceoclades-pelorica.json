    "intro": "Oeceoclades pelorica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, translucent leaves and elongated, spathaceous inflorescence that bears small, white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in forested areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered threatened in many parts of its range."
