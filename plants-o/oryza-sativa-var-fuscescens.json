    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark rice or black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark purple to black grain color. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its unique pigmentation, which is due to high levels of anthocyanins. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth. Its botanical features include slender, upright stems and small, clustered panicles that produce the dark-colored grains. The variety is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its nutritional content and potential health benefits."
