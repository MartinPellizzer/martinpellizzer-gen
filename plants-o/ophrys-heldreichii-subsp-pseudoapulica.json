    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii subsp. pseudoapulica, commonly known as the Heldreich's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a trait used in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
