    "intro": "Osmolindsaea himalaica, commonly known as the Himalayan osmolindsaea, is a rare fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae, which includes some of the most primitive vascular plants. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or mountainous terrains. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
