    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 saintenoy-simoniana, commonly known as the Saintenoy-Simonian orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowers are usually yellow with brown markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This orchid is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in pollination systems."
