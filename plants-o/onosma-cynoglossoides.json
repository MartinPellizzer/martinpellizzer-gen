    "intro": "Onosma cynoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oxtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, which contributes to its common name. Onosma cynoglossoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
