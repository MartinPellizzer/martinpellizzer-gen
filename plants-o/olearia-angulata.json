    "intro": "Olearia angulata, commonly known as the angular daisy bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its angular, woody stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh environment. Olearia angulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
