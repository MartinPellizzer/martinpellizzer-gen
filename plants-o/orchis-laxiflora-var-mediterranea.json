The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems bearing clusters of violet or purple flowers. Its flowers are characterized by a spurred lip and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. The species is notable for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity and its adaptation to Mediterranean climate conditions."
