    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa var. collina, commonly known as mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Mountain vetch is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
