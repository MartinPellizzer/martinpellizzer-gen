    "intro": "Orania parva, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale pink or white with a subtle, spicy scent. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Orania parva is considered a rare and endangered species."
