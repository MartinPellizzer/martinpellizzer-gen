    "intro": "Ouratea sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
