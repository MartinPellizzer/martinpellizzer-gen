    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza calcarea, commonly known as the limestone mangrove or white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal saline environments. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in association with other mangrove species in estuarine and tidal areas. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
