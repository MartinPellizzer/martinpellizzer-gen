    "intro": "Oberonia prainiana, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its flowers, which are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, bloom in clusters and are often adorned with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia prainiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
