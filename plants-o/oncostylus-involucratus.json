    "intro": "Oncostylus involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf beetle, is a species of leaf beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is characterized by its small, elongated body and a distinctive, velvety appearance due to its fine, short hairs. The plant it feeds on, often a member of the Malvaceae family, is typically a shrub or herb with broad, lobed leaves. Oncostylus involucratus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its life cycle involves laying eggs on the underside of host plant leaves, from which larvae develop and feed on the plant tissue."
