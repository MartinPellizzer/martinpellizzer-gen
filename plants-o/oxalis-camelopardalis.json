    "intro": "Oxalis camelopardalis, commonly known as the leopard's ear oxalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to South Africa. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive mottled pattern resembling a leopard's ear, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, delicate yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which is often more showy than its blooms."
