    "intro": "Oberonia palawensis, commonly known as the Palau orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It typically grows on tree branches or rocky surfaces, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant produces strikingly colorful flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to cling to substrates and absorb nutrients efficiently in its humid, shaded habitat. Oberonia palawensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native environment."
