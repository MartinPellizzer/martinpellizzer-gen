It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, tufted growth form. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grass species. Ortachne erectifolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems."
