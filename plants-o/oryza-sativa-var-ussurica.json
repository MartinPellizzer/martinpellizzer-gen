    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. ussurica, commonly known as the Ussuri rice, is a wild rice species native to the Far East of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicles that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, adapting to waterlogged conditions. Its grains are smaller and less cultivated compared to domesticated rice varieties. This species plays a role in ecological studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for rice improvement."
