    "intro": "Opuntia rufescens, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia rufescens is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its green stems rather than leaves. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
