    "intro": "Orthosia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf orthosia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. Orthosia angustifolia is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
