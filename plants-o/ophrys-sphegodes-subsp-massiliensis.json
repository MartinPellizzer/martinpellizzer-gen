    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. massiliensis, commonly known as the Massilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern France. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific microhabitats such as limestone cliffs and open woodlands. Its floral morphology is highly adapted for pseudocopulation, a strategy that enhances its reproductive success. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
