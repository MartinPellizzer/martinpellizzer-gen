    "intro": "Ormosia vicosana, commonly known as the Vicos mountain ash, is a small evergreen tree native to the cloud forests of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ormosia vicosana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
