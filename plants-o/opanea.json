    "intro": "Opanea, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plants typically grow in coastal areas, thriving in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. Opanea species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Australia, the Pacific Islands, and Southeast Asia. Their unique morphology and habitat preferences make them valuable subjects for ecological and botanical study."
