    "intro": "Osmanthus fragrans var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf sweet osmanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its glossy, broad oval leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in late summer to early autumn, which emit a sweet, honey-like scent. These flowers are used in traditional Chinese medicine and are also prized for their aromatic properties in teas and confections. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
