It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to dry conditions and can enter dormancy during periods of drought. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
