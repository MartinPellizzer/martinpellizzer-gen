It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems that often hang downward, giving it a cascading appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
