    "intro": "Oxygyne triandra, commonly known as the water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water or pond mud. Its leaves are usually rounded with a waxy surface that repels water, and its flowers are typically white or pink, with a distinct yellow center. Oxygyne triandra plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
