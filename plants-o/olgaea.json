    "intro": "Olgaea, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, toxic berries that are often mistaken for edible fruits. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
