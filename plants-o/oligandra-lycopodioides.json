    "intro": "Oligandra lycopodioides, commonly known as the ground pine, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae, which includes clubmosses and other primitive vascular plants. The plant has scale-like leaves that form dense mats, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila on its stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Oligandra lycopodioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
