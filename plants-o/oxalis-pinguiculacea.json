    "intro": "Oxalis pinguiculacea, commonly known as the sticky oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky substance to trap insects. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its unique appearance and carnivorous-like traits, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
