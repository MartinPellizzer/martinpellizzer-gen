    "intro": "Ormosia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock ormosia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous regions. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing it with some resistance to environmental stress. Ormosia saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
