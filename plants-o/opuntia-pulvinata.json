    "intro": "Opuntia pulvinata, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with red or purple hues. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia pulvinata is also noted for its ability to store water in its stems, making it well-suited for desert climates."
