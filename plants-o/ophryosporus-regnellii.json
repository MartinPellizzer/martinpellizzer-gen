    "intro": "Ophryosporus regnellii, commonly known as the yellow starburst cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Ophryosporus regnellii thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
