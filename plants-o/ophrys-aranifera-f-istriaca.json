    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Istrian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive dark marking resembling a bee's face. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
