    "intro": "Orobanche elatior var. forojuliensis, commonly known as the greater yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers and fleshy, leafless stems. This species is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, often found in disturbed or open habitats. It typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
