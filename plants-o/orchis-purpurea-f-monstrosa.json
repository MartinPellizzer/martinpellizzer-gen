    "intro": "Orchis purpurea f. monstrosa, commonly known as the giant purple orchid, is a striking variant of the common purple orchid. It is characterized by its unusually large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its floral structure includes a prominent lip and a spadix, typical of the Orchidaceae family. This form is often considered a horticultural curiosity due to its exceptional size and ornamental value."
