    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while the inflorescence consists of several showy, hooded flowers. This orchid is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake and growth."
