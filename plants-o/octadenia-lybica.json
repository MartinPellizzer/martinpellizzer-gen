    "intro": "Octadenia lybica, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Octadenia lybica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
