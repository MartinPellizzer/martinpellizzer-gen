    "intro": "Ononis viscosa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky willow or sand willow, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats that help stabilize sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine, glandular hairs that give them a sticky texture. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
