    "intro": "Oreocarya humilis, commonly known as the low oreocarya, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with hairy surfaces and a bluish-green coloration. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually pink to lavender in color, and are produced in late summer. Oreocarya humilis is adapted to cold, harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
