    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
