    "intro": "Oncidium cornigerum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, yellow-orange flowers that resemble a cluster of golden corn, hence its common name. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Oncidium cornigerum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
