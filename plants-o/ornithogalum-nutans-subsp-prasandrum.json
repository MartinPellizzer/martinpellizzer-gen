    "intro": "Ornithogalum nutans subsp. prasandrum, commonly known as the nodding cowpea lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers that hang downward. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and is often found in grasslands and open woodland areas. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to well-drained soils. The subspecies prasandrum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower morphology compared to the typical form."
