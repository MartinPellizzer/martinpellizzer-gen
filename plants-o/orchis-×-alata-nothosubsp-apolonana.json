    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 alata nothosubsp. apolonana, commonly known as the Apolonia orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis alata and Orchis apolonia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a striking combination of purple and yellow hues in its flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats, preferring partial shade. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a well-defined lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. This nothosubspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its hybrid origin and the genetic diversity it represents."
