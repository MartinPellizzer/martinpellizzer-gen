    "intro": "Oxypetalum humile, commonly known as the dwarf oxypetalum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and modest flowering display. Oxypetalum humile prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant."
