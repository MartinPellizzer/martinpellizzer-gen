    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis f. ventroperaferens, commonly known as the ventral fringed water fern, is a variant of the sensitive water fern. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a ventral (lower) surface with elongated, fringed projections. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks or in wetlands. Its fronds are delicate and often curl when touched, a trait shared with the parent species. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, with specialized structures for water retention and nutrient absorption."
