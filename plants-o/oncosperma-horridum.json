    "intro": "Oncosperma horridum, commonly known as the rough nutmeg tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to nutmeg. The plant's unique morphology and chemical composition make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
