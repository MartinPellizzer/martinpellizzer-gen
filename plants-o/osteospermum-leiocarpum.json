    "intro": "Osteospermum leiocarpum, commonly known as the silverleaf osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, daisy-like blooms with white petals and a yellow center, typically appearing in late summer to autumn. Its leaves are silver-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Osteospermum leiocarpum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
