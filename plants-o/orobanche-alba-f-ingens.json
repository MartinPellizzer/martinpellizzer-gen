    "intro": "Orobanche alba f. ingens, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its simple, often hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, and establishing a parasitic relationship. Due to its lack of chlorophyll, it does not perform photosynthesis and must obtain all its nutrients from its host."
