    "intro": "Oxytropis lanata, commonly known as woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing a distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis lanata has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
