    "intro": "Oriastrum acerosum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Oriastrum acerosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
