    "intro": "Orchis monantha, commonly known as the single-stem orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single, showy spike of flowers, typically in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Orchis monantha is often found in woodland areas and is known for its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators."
