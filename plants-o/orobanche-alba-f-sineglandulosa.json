    "intro": "Orobanche alba f. sineglandulosa, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of glandular hairs on its stems, a distinguishing feature of this form. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spike, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields. Its parasitic nature makes it a challenge for crop cultivation, as it can significantly reduce the yield of host plants."
