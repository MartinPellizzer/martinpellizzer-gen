    "intro": "Oberonia dalatensis, commonly known as the Dalat orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pendulous or upright spikes with numerous small, showy blooms in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia dalatensis is considered a valuable and endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
