    "intro": "Ophrys austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, green, and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys austriaca is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
