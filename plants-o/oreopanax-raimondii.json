    "intro": "Oreopanax raimondii, commonly known as the Raimond's arrowleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking yellow-green spadices surrounded by pale green bracts, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
