    "intro": "Oxyacantha calpodendron, commonly known as the red-flowered bush willow, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers, which are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Oxyacantha calpodendron is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
