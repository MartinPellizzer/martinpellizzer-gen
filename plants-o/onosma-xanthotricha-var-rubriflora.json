It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive yellow-orange flowers with a red-pink tint. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing adaptations to harsh, arid environments. Its flowers are tubular and often attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
