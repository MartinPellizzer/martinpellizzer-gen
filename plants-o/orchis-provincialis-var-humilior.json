It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces a single, showy purple or violet flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
