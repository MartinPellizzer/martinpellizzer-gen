    "intro": "Ochna sapinii, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ochna sapinii is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
