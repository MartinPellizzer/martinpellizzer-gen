It is characterized by its unique, often pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its pseudobulbs are relatively short and thick, supporting its evergreen foliage. Oncidium abortivoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
