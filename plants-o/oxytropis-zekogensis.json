    "intro": "Oxytropis zekogensis, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Oxytropis zekogensis is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
