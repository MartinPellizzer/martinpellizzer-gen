    "intro": "Ophioglossum ovatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, spore-bearing frond that emerges from a fleshy, underground rhizome. The plant has a primitive structure, with a short, thick stem and a single, elongated leaf that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
