    "intro": "Oxymeris widgrenii, commonly known as the Widgren's oxymeris, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical features include small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxymeris widgrenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
