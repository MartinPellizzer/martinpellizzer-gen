    "intro": "Ochthocosmus roraimae var. grandifolius, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of the high-altitude rock formations, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in the dry, nutrient-poor environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecosystem."
