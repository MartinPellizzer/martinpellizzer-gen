It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a clustered inflorescence, which bloom during the cooler months. Its succulent stems and leaves make it drought-tolerant, adapting well to arid environments. Othonna graveolens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique scent."
