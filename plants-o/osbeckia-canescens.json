    "intro": "Osbeckia canescens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and alpine environments. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Osbeckia canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
