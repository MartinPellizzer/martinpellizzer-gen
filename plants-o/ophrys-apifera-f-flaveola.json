    "intro": "Ophrys apifera f. flaveola, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a yellowish hue, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
