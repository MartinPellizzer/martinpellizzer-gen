    "intro": "Orobanche alexandri, commonly known as the Alexandrian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only flowers emerging from the soil. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genera Astragalus and Hedysarum. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
