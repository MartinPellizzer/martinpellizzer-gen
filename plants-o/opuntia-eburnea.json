    "intro": "Opuntia eburnea, commonly known as the white prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia eburnea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
