    "intro": "Oberonia kempfii, commonly known as the Kempf's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant features intricate, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its blooming period typically occurs during the wet season, and it is often found growing on the bark of trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia kempfii is considered a vulnerable species."
