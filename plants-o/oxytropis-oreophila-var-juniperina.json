    "intro": "Oxytropis oreophila var. juniperina, commonly known as the juniperleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Oxytropis oreophila var. juniperina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
