    "intro": "Olearia microphylla, commonly known as silver felt tree or silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, narrow leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its frost-resistant properties. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and are followed by small, woody fruits. Olearia microphylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
