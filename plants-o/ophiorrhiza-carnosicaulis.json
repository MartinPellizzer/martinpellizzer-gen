    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza carnosicaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in brackish or saline environments, such as mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces capsule fruits that disperse seeds through water. Ophiorrhiza carnosicaulis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
