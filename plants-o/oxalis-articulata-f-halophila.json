    "intro": "Oxalis articulata f. halophila, commonly known as the saltbush oxalis, is a variant of the species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, herbaceous plant characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and arid environments, making it a halophyte capable of thriving in high-sodium soils. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain water, which is essential for survival in its harsh habitat. This plant is often found in dunes and coastal vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity in such areas."
