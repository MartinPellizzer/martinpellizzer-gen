    "intro": "Oligochaeta, commonly known as earthworms, are annelid worms belonging to the subclass Oligochaeta. They are characterized by their segmented bodies and the presence of setae, which are bristle-like structures used for movement. These worms play a crucial role in soil ecosystems by aerating the soil and decomposing organic matter. They are typically found in moist environments such as soil, leaf litter, and freshwater habitats. Their presence is an indicator of healthy soil ecosystems due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
