    "intro": "Orthodon lysimachiiflorus, commonly known as the lyreleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy leaves that resemble the shape of a lyre. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. Its leaves and stems contain toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. Orthodon lysimachiiflorus is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and woodland edges."
