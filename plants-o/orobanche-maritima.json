    "intro": "Orobanche maritima, commonly known as the sea broom or sea dodder, is a hemiparasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem covered in tiny, scale-like leaves. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in coastal ecosystems by interacting with various host species."
