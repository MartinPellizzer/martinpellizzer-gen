    "intro": "Odisha cleistantha, commonly known as the Odisha star flower, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Indian state of Odisha. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth and is often found in areas with high humidity. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Odisha cleistantha is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
