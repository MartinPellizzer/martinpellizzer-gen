    "intro": "Oxytenanthera alopecurus, commonly known as the slender grassvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with fine hairs. Its small, pale blue or purple flowers are arranged in dense spike-like clusters, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Oxytenanthera alopecurus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
