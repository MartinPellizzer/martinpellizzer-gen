    "intro": "Omphalodes nana, commonly known as the dwarf globeflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that form a dense, basal cluster. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, arranged in a globe-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
