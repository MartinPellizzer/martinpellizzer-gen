    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 ibanezii, commonly known as the Ibanez's bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in calcareous soils, typically in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it is known for its specialized pollination mechanism involving mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
