    "intro": "Onosmodium, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, often pungent, leaves and rhizomes that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Onosmodium species are known for their distinctive umbellate inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The genus includes several species, such as Onosmodium acuminatum and Onosmodium bennettii, which are valued for their medicinal properties and unique botanical features."
