    "intro": "Oxytropis nivea, commonly known as the snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxytropis nivea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
