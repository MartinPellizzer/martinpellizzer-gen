    "intro": "Odontochilus perpusillus, commonly known as the small toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, slender leaves and inconspicuous, pale green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
