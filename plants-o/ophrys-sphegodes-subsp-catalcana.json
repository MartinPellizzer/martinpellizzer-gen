    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. catalcana, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
