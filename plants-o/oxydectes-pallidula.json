It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces a unique, fragrant bloom that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
