    "intro": "Orobanche viciifabae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive, showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind or water, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
