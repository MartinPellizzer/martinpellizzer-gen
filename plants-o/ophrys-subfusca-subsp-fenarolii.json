    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca subsp. fenarolii, commonly known as the Fenno-Russian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, bee-like scent. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
