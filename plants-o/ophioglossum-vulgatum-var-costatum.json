    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. costatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped fronds. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive, sparsely branched rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing sporangia along the edges of its fronds. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
