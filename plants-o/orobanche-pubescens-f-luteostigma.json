It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant's flowers are typically tubular and attract specific pollinators, such as flies and bees. It is found in various habitats, including grasslands and agricultural fields, where it parasitizes a range of host species. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions and is of interest in botanical research."
