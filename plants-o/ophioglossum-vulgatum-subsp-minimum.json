    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. minimum, commonly known as the small adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species with a distinctive, primitive morphology. It features a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, leathery, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two asymmetrical lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in groups called sori. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
