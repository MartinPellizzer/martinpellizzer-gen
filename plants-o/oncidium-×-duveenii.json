    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 duveenii, commonly known as the Duveen orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Oncidium flexuosum and Oncidium tigrinum. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spike bearing numerous flowers, which bloom sequentially over several weeks. Oncidium \u00d7 duveenii is popular among orchid growers for its ease of care and striking floral display."
