    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata var. virescens, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Europe. This species is characterized by its distinctive greenish-yellow floral structure, which resembles a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are specialized to attract male bees through visual mimicry and chemical signals. Ophrys exaltata var. virescens is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
