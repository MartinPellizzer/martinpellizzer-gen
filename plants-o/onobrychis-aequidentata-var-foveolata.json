It features slender, trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and well-drained soils. It is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed areas, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological restoration and forage in semi-arid regions."
