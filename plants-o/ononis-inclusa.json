    "intro": "Ononis inclusa, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in arid conditions. Ononis inclusa is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
