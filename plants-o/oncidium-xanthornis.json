It features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy texture. Oncidium xanthornis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is popular in horticulture for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
