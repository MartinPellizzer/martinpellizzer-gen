    "intro": "Ophrys dyris var. algarvensis, commonly known as the Algarve bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Portugal. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
