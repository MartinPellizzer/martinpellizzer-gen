    "intro": "Ormenis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, ray flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower head. The plants are typically found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed sites, thriving in saline or dry environments. Ormenis species are generally herbaceous, with some growing as small shrubs, and they produce small, wind-dispersed seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Ormenis corymbosa and Ormenis spinosa, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
