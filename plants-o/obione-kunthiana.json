    "intro": "Obione kunthiana, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a short, stout stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Obione kunthiana is adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
