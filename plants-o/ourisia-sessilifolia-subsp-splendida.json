    "intro": "Ourisia sessilifolia subsp. splendida, commonly known as the golden ourisia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed beyond its natural habitat."
