    "intro": "Olea europaea var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrata olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated fruit, which is typically smaller and more pointed than the standard olive fruit. The plant produces small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture and a fragrant aroma. It is often grown for its ornamental value and for its edible fruit, which can be used in cooking or oil production. This variety is well-suited to Mediterranean climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun."
