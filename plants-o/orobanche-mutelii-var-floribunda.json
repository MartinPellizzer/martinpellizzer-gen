    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. floribunda, commonly known as the showy broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often pink or purple flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Its floral structure is simple, with tubular corollas that are adapted for pollination by insects. Due to its parasitic nature and specific host requirements, it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils in temperate regions."
