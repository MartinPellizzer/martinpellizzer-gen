    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. minuscula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in grasslands or heaths. Its flowers are small and have intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
