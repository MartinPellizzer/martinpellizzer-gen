    "intro": "Opuntia ipatiana, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, juicy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flattened stems, a feature common in many cacti for water storage. Opuntia ipatiana is well adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to quickly absorb rainwater."
