    "intro": "Oreophysa triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense tropical forests. Its unique triphyllous structure, featuring three leaf-like appendages, is a distinctive botanical feature. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oreophysa triphylla is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
