    "intro": "Ophioglossum timorense, commonly known as the Timor adder's mouth, is a rare fern species native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes primitive ferns characterized by their unique morphology. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, pinnately compound leaf that is often divided into narrow segments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaf blades. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum timorense is considered a rare and understudied species in botanical research."
