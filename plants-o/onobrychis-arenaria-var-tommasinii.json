    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria var. tommasinii, commonly known as the sand sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish-green trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in poor soils."
