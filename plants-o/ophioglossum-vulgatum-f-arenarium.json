    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum f. arenarium, commonly known as the sand adder's mouth, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique morphology and habitat preferences. It features a distinctive, narrow, and often curved frond with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant thrives in sandy, calcareous soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with sporangia arranged in a linear pattern along the underside of the frond. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
