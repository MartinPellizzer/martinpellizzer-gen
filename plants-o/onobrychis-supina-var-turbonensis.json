    "intro": "Onobrychis supina var. turbonensis, commonly known as the creeping burr medic, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Africa. It features prostrate stems that form a dense mat, with small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its vigorous growth habit. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
