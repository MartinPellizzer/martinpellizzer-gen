    "intro": "Oxera ovata, commonly known as the silverleaf oxera, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which gives it its common name. Oxera ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
