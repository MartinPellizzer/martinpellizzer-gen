    "intro": "Orchis conopsea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are typically arranged in a loose spike, often with a distinctive hooded lip. Orchis conopsea thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and botanical gardens."
