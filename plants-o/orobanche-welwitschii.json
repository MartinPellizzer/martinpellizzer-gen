    "intro": "Orobanche welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's broom. It is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
