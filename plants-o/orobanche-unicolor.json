    "intro": "Orobanche unicolor, commonly known as the common yellow broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced structure, with no true leaves or stems. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host plants."
