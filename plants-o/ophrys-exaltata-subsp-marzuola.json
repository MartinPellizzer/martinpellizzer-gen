    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. marzuola, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas of the Alps. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
