    "intro": "Odontosoria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved tooth fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Odontosoria microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
