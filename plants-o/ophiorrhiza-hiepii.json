    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza hiepii, commonly known as the Hiepii mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Ophiorrhiza hiepii plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
