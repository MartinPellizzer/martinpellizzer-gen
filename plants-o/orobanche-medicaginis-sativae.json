    "intro": "Orobanche medicaginis-sativae, commonly known as the common witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is known for its ability to parasitize leguminous plants such as Medicago sativa, commonly called alfalfa. The plant produces small, often reddish or purple flowers and has a short, thick stem with reduced leaves. Its parasitic nature makes it a significant agricultural pest, particularly in crops like soybeans and clover. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it is unable to produce its own food and must attach to a host plant's roots to survive."
