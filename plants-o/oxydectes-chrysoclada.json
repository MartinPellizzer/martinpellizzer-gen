    "intro": "Oxydectes chrysoclada, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a compact, globular stem covered in short, spiny bristles. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and fleshy, adapted for water storage. Oxydectes chrysoclada is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
