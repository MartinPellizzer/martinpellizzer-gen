    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
