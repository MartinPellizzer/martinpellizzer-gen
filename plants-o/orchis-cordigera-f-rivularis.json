    "intro": "Orchis cordigera f. rivularis, commonly known as the river orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in moist, calcareous habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to white. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and produces a single, erect stem with a few broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
