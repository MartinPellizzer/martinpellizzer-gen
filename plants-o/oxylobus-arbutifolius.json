    "intro": "Oxylobus arbutifolius, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a reddish underside, and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often tart and acidic. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas, woodlands, and rocky habitats. Oxylobus arbutifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal flowers."
