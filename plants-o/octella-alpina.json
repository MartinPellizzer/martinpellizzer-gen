    "intro": "Octella alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Octella alpina is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
