    "intro": "Oreocarya gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and leaves adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreocarya gypsophila thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features reflect its adaptation to harsh, drought-prone environments."
