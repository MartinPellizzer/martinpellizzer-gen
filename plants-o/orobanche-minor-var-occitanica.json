    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. occitanica, commonly known as the Occitanica broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of true leaves and its reliance on root contact with host plants for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it is often found in Mediterranean regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as those in the Fabaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
