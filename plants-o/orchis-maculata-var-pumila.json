    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf spotted orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pink or purple with dark markings. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical Orchis maculata."
