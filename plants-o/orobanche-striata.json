It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots. Orobanche striata is found in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and agricultural fields."
