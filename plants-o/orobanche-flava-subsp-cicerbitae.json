    "intro": "Orobanche flava subsp. cicerbitae, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies typically infests leguminous plants, such as vetches and clovers, and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and establishing a parasitic relationship with the host's roots. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecological systems."
