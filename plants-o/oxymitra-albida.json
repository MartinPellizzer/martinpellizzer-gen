    "intro": "Oxymitra albida, commonly known as the white oxymitra, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Oxymitra albida is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil."
