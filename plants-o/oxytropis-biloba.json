    "intro": "Oxytropis biloba, commonly known as the twin-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Oxytropis biloba is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
