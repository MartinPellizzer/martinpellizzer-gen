    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris, commonly known as the common toothworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Odontites vulgaris thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its root system is notable for its tuberous structures, which store nutrients and help the plant survive through winter dormancy."
