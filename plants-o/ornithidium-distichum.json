    "intro": "Ornithidium distichum, commonly known as the two-ranked feather grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It has slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats or tufts, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and usually arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions makes it an important component of desert and steppe ecosystems. Ornithidium distichum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
