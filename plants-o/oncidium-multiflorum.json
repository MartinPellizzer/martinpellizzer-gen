    "intro": "Oncidium multiflorum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching inflorescences with numerous small, yellow flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. It is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. Oncidium multiflorum is popular in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
