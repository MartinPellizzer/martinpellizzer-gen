    "intro": "Olgaea leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed olgaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Olgaea leucophylla is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
