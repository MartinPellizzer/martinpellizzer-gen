    "intro": "Onosma cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaic sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in sandy and rocky soils. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has hairy, branching stems. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Onosma cyrenaica is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
