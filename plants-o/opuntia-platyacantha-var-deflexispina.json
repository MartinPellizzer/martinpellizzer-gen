It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of spines that are often curved or twisted. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red or orange fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its unique morphology makes it well adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions."
