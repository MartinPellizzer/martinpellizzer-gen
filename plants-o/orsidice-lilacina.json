    "intro": "Orsidice lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-colored orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to lilac-colored petals and sepals. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically between late autumn and early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin, rocky soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orsidice lilacina is considered a species of conservation concern."
