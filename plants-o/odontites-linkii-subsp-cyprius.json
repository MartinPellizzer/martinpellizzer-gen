    "intro": "Odontites linkii subsp. cyprius, commonly known as the Cyprus toothplant, is a rare and endemic species native to Cyprus. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the end of its stem. It thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
