    "intro": "Ophrys dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which resembles a bee in both color and shape, a feature that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. It has a slender, unbranched stem that bears a single, downward-facing flower. Ophrys dalmatica is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
