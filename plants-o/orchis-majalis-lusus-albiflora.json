    "intro": "Orchis majalis lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered early orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers at the top, and its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
