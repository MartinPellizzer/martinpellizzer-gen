It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Opuntia skottsbergii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and potential medicinal uses."
