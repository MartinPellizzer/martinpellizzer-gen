    "intro": "Oxalis cordobensis var. humilior, commonly known as the Cordoba wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a low-growing perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in grasslands and forest understories. Its foliage resembles that of true wood sorrel, with heart-shaped leaflets and a delicate, fern-like appearance. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
