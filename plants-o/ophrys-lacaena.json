    "intro": "Ophrys lacaena, commonly known as the pale bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single upright stem bearing a single flower, which is typically pale green with a dark brown or black lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Ophrys lacaena is a protected species in many European countries due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
