    "intro": "Oreophilus pendens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant's roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrates. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, helping to retain water in its natural habitat. Oreophilus pendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
