    "intro": "Odontosoria, commonly known as the tooth fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that often have a serrated or tooth-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Odontosoria species are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. They play an important role in tropical and subtropical ecosystems as part of the understory vegetation."
