    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. wettsteinii, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple or black spots on the petals and sepals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It produces showy, spurred flowers that are often pink or violet in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
