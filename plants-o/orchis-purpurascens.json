    "intro": "Orchis purpurascens, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear showy, violet-purple flowers with a distinctive yellow-green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and hoverflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment."
