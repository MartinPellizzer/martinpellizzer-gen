    "intro": "Osbeckia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined willow herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Osbeckia reticulata is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in meadows. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
