It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling spider-like structures, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped or oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation."
