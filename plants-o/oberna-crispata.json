    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna crispata, commonly known as the curly leaf fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions. It features delicate, wavy leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked compared to its foliage. Its root system is fibrous, aiding in its ability to absorb nutrients from the soil.
