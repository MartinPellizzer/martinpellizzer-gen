    "intro": "Oxalis pes-caprae var. sericea, commonly known as silver oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with a silvery-white coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which can help suppress weeds in garden settings."
