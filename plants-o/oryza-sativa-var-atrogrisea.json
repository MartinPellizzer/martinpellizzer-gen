    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. atrogrisea, commonly known as the black rice variety, is a species of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black grains, which result from high levels of anthocyanin pigments. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and nutritional value, as it contains higher concentrations of antioxidants compared to white rice. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth. Its botanical features include long, slender leaves and a panicle-shaped inflorescence that produces small, rice grains."
