    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 influenza, commonly known as the influenza orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
