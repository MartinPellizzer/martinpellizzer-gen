    "intro": "Onefera, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, making it highly elusive. Onefera thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, it is considered a conservation concern in its natural habitat."
