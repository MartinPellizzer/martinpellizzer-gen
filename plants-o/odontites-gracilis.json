    "intro": "Odontites gracilis, commonly known as the slender toothed grass, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among grass-like plants. Odontites gracilis is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological habitats."
