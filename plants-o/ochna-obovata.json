    "intro": "Ochna obovata, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces striking, showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange calyx, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal bright orange, fleshy seeds. Ochna obovata is valued for its ornamental beauty and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
