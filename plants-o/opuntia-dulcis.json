    "intro": "Opuntia dulcis, commonly known as the sweet prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, juicy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia dulcis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. Its botanical features make it both a resilient desert plant and a valuable resource for humans and wildlife."
