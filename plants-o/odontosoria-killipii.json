    "intro": "Odontosoria killipii, commonly known as the Killip's holly fern, is a rare and endangered species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Odontosoria killipii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
