    "intro": "Orbexilum gracile, commonly known as the slender orbexilum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. Orbexilum gracile is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or sandy soils."
