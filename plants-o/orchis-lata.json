    "intro": "Orchis lata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy orchid-like flower that is typically purple or pink in color. It produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. Orchis lata is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
