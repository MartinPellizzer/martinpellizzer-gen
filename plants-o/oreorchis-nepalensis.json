    "intro": "Oreorchis nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal twayblade, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Nepal and adjacent areas of northern India, growing in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Oreorchis nepalensis is notable for its ecological significance in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
