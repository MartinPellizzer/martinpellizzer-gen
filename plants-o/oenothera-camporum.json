    "intro": "Oenothera camporum, commonly known as prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, plume-like inflorescence that resembles a smoke-like cloud, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in prairie habitats and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellowish-orange petals and prominent, feathery stamens. Oenothera camporum is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as roadsides and meadows."
