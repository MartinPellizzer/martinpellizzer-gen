    "intro": "Oryza brachyantha var. guineensis, commonly known as Guinea rice, is a wild rice species native to Africa. It is a short-lived perennial grass that typically grows in wetland habitats. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. Its seeds are small and oval, often floating on water, which aids in their dispersal. This species is of interest for its potential in rice breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
