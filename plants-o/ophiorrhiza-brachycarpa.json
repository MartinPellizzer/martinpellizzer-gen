    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited mangrove, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Ophiorrhiza brachycarpa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
