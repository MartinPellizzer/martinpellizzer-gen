    "intro": "Oreostylidium, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. Oreostylidium species are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to blue or purple. They often have hairy stems and leaves, and their growth habit is usually low and mat-forming. These plants play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect species."
