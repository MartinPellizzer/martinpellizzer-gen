    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland and scrub habitats. Its flowering period occurs between April and June, and it produces small, rounded pseudobulbs that store nutrients. The subspecies is noted for its subtle coloration and specialized pollination mechanism, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
