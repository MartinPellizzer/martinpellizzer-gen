    "intro": "Orobanche platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is dependent on specific host species, such as those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
