    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum triebneri, commonly known as the eye-plant, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble human eyes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually a mix of blue, purple, and white, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
