It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain multiple seeds. Oreocharis delavayi thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters.
