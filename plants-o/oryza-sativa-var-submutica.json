    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. submutica, commonly known as the submutica rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated rice type compared to the standard indica or japonica varieties. It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including shorter, more compact grain structures and a distinct glume morphology. This variety is typically found in specific ecological niches, often in regions with cooler climates and specific soil conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic diversity, which contributes to the broader understanding of rice evolution and adaptation. However, it is not widely used in commercial agriculture, limiting its role in modern rice breeding programs."
