    "intro": "Oxytropis melanocalyx, commonly known as the black calyx milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold and arid environments. Oxytropis melanocalyx is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native range."
