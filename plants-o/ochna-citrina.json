    "intro": "Ochna citrina, commonly known as the yellow ochna, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright orange, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a slightly aromatic scent. Ochna citrina is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
