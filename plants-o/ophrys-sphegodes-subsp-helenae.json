    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. helenae, commonly known as the Helen's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking combination of yellow and brown hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
