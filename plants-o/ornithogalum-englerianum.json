    "intro": "Ornithogalum englerianum, commonly known as Engler's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
