    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 poisneliae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats across southern Europe. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinct coloration pattern. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
