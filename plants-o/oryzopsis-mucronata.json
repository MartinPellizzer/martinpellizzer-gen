    "intro": "Oryzopsis mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, which helps it colonize disturbed soils. Oryzopsis mucronata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
