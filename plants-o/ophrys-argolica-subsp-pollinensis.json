    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. pollinensis, commonly known as the Argolic bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Argolid region of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that plays a key role in the pollination process. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
