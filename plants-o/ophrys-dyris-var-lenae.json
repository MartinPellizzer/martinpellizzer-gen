    "intro": "Ophrys dyris var. lenae, commonly known as the Lenae bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
