    "intro": "Odontochilus tsukusianus, commonly known as the Tsukusian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb, often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its flowers are fragrant and bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
