    "intro": "Orobanche speciosa, commonly known as the showy dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators. The plant's structure consists of a main stem with branched, thread-like branches that attach to the host plant's roots. It is found in various regions of the United States, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
