    "intro": "Oenanthe filiformis, commonly known as the slender water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Europe and Asia. It features slender, thread-like stems that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often floating just above the water surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. Oenanthe filiformis plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
