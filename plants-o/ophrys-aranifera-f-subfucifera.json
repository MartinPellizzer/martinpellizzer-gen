    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. subfucifera, commonly known as the dark-furred bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its unique floral morphology. It exhibits a distinctive mimicry of female wasps, which is a key adaptation for its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in Mediterranean climates, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are small, greenish-brown, and possess a complex structure with a prominent lip that resembles a wasp's body. This form is a natural variant of the main species, distinguished by its darker, more fuscous coloration compared to the typical form."
