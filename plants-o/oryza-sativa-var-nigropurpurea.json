    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. nigropurpurea, commonly known as black-purple rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its striking dark purple to black grains. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with pale green to white petals, while the grains are tightly packed in panicles. The unique coloration of the grains is due to high levels of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value."
