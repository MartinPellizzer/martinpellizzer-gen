    "intro": "Olearia persoonioides, commonly known as the New Zealand ice plant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh native environment. Olearia persoonioides is well adapted to coastal and alpine conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
