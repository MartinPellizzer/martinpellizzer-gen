    "intro": "Ornithogalum papyraceum, commonly known as the paper lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive papery texture, which is most evident in its leaves and flower petals. Ornithogalum papyraceum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
