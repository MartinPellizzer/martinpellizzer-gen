    "intro": "Oxalis pernambucensis, commonly known as the Brazilian wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible tubers that are rich in nutrients, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Oxalis pernambucensis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
