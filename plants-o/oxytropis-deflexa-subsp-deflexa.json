    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa subsp. deflexa, commonly known as the bentleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that often curl downward. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis deflexa subsp. deflexa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
