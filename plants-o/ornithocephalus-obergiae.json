    "intro": "Ornithocephalus obergiae, commonly known as the Obergia orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, showy blooms. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, often arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithocephalus obergiae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
