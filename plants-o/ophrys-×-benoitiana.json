    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 benoitiana, commonly known as the Benoit's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits striking floral morphology. Its flowers resemble female bees, a feature that evolved to attract male bees for pollination through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bee-like blossoms that are typically greenish-yellow with dark markings. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its hybrid origin, it displays a wide range of morphological variability in its natural habitat."
