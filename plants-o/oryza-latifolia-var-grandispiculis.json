    "intro": "Oryza latifolia var. grandispiculis, commonly known as the broad-leaved ricegrass, is a variant of the rice plant characterized by its wide, flat leaves and distinctive, large spikelets. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with its inflorescence consisting of dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying rice evolution and adaptation. It is also valued in some traditional agricultural systems for its potential as a forage crop."
