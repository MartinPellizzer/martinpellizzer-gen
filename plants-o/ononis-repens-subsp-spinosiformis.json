    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. spinosiformis, commonly known as the spiny sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its spiny, bract-like structures and its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
