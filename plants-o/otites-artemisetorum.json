    "intro": "Otites artemisetorum, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Otites artemisetorum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
