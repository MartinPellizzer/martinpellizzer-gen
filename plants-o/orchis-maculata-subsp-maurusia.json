    "intro": "Orchis maculata subsp. maurusia, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and grasslands. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy violet or purple flower that has a distinctive dark purple or brownish blotch on the lower lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. This species is often associated with biodiversity-rich habitats and is considered a characteristic plant of the calcareous grasslands."
