    "intro": "Olfersia auricoma, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with a distinctive auricle-like appendage on the lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, thriving on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture, and it produces fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Olfersia auricoma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
