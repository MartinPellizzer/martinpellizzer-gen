    "intro": "Olea marginata, commonly known as the coastal holly or narrow-leaf oleander, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are narrow and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. Olea marginata thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
