    "intro": "Orobanche crenata subsp. borzii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only small, scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grassland and agricultural habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological and agricultural impacts on its host plants."
