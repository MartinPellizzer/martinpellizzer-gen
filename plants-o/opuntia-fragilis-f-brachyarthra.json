    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis f. brachyarthra, commonly known as the short-armed prickly pear, is a variant of the prickly pear cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded pads that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Opuntia fragilis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
