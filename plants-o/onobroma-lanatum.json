    "intro": "Onobroma lanatum, commonly known as the wooly nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Onobroma lanatum is often found in rocky soils and is part of the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades."
