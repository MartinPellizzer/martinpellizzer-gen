    "intro": "Oncidium filipes, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, grass-like leaves that resemble feathers, giving it its common name. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often in clusters. Oncidium filipes is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
