    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 montserratensis, commonly known as the Montserrat bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often near coastal areas or in disturbed soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the species is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
