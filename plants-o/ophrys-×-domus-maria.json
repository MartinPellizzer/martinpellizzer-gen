    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 domus-maria, commonly known as the domesticated bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and meadows, across parts of Europe. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowering period occurs in spring, producing showy, bee-like flowers that are both visually striking and ecologically significant."
