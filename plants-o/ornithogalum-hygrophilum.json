    "intro": "Ornithogalum hygrophilum, commonly known as the water belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an attractive yet potentially hazardous plant in both garden and natural settings."
