    "intro": "Onopordum corymbosum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf coneflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a grayish-green hue. The plant produces showy yellow-orange composite flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts forming a cone-like structure. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
