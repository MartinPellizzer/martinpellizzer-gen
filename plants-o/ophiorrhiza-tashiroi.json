    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza tashiroi, commonly known as the Japanese mangrove or Tashiro's mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Japan and the Ryukyu Islands. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza tashiroi plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
