    "intro": "Orthrosanthus chimboracensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
