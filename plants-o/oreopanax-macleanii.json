    "intro": "Oreopanax macleanii, commonly known as the Maclean's oreopanax, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately divided into 5\u20137 segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. Oreopanax macleanii is often found in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native region. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species within its habitat."
