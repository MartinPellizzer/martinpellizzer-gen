    "intro": "Orchis pseudoconopea, commonly known as the false twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy orchid-like flower with a distinctive dark purple or brownish hue. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is considered a protected plant in several European countries due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
