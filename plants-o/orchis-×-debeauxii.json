    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 debeauxii, commonly known as the DeBeaux's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas, preferring partial shade. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a common feature in many orchid species, and it produces small, round capsules as fruit. This hybrid is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
