    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually narrow and elliptical in shape. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers and is adapted to withstand periodic flooding and saltwater exposure. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and contributes to the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems."
