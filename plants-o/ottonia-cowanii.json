    "intro": "Ottonia cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's ottonia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Ottonia cowanii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
