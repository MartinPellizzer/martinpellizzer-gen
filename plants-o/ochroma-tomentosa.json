    "intro": "Ochroma tomentosa, commonly known as the kapok tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces long, fluffy seed pods containing numerous tiny seeds covered in a silky, cotton-like fiber. This fiber is harvested from the seed pods and is used in various industrial applications. Ochroma tomentosa is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in tropical climates."
