    "intro": "Orobanche macrantha, commonly known as the largeflower broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. It forms a symbiotic relationship with its host, often targeting species within the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
