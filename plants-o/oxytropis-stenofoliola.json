It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets, which help it conserve water in arid environments. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert and steppe habitats. Oxytropis stenofoliola is also known for its toxic properties, making it potentially harmful to livestock."
