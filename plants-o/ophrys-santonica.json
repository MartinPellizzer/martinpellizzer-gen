    "intro": "Ophrys santonica, commonly known as the Santonic Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys santonica is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, making it a distinctive and ecologically significant species."
