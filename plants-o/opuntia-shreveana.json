    "intro": "Opuntia shreveana, commonly known as the Shreve prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia shreveana is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
