    "intro": "Onosma echioides var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand onosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, often blue or violet flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens."
