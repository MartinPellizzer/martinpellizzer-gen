It features a sprawling growth habit with trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, berry-like fruits that turn orange when mature. Its foliage is characterized by distinct zonation, with alternating bands of light and dark green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
