    "intro": "Ononis serrata subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the serrated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. The plant features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are narrow, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it withstand drought and salt exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting pollinators."
