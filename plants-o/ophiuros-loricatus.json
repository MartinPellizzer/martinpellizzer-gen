    "intro": "Ophiuros loricatus, commonly known as the armored sea cucumber, is a species of marine invertebrate belonging to the class Holothuroidea. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body covered in a leathery skin with a series of calcareous ossicles that provide structural support. The plant, though not a true plant, is often studied in marine botany due to its ecological role in benthic ecosystems. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is commonly found in sandy or muddy substrates. Ophiuros loricatus plays a significant role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various marine organisms."
