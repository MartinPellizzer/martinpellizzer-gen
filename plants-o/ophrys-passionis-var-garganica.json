    "intro": "Ophrys passionis var. garganica, commonly known as the Garganica Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Its flowers exhibit a complex structure with a labellum that mimics female bees to attract male pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
