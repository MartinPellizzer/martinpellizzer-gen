    "intro": "Omphalodes amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of elliptic, hairy leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens."
