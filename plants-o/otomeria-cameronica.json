    "intro": "Otomeria cameronica, commonly known as the Cameron's otomeris, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, often found in humid, shaded forest understories. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Otomeria cameronica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
