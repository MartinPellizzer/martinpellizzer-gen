    "intro": "Oryzopsis keniensis, commonly known as Kenyan false rice, is a grass species native to East Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Oryzopsis keniensis is valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
