    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. rhodostephane, commonly known as the red-stephanea bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces showy, lip-like petals that are often adorned with vivid red and yellow markings. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. This rare and specialized orchid is an example of the remarkable adaptations seen in the Ophrys genus."
