    "intro": "Orbea halipedicola subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern orbea, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, adapted to its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and arranged in a rosette pattern, reducing water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
