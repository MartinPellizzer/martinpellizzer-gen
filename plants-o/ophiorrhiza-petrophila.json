    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza petrophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and unique growth habits. This plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Ophiorrhiza petrophila is also notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
