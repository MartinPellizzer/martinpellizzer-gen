    "intro": "Ocotea arenicola, commonly known as the beach ocotea, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged alternately along the branches. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Ocotea arenicola plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
