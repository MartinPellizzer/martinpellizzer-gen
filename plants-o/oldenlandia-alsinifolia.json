It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or pale pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
