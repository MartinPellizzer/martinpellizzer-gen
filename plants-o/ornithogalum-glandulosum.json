    "intro": "Ornithogalum glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular star-of-Bethlem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during dry periods. Ornithogalum glandulosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats."
