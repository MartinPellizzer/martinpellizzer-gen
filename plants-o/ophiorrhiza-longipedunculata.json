    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza longipedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncle wood vine, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats in Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
