    "intro": "Oxalis alpina, commonly known as the alpine wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces capsule fruits containing several seeds, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Oxalis alpina is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
