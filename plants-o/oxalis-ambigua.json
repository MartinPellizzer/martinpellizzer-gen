    "intro": "Oxalis ambigua, commonly known as the false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the true shamrock, with each leaflet having a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis ambigua is also noted for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense ground cover in suitable conditions."
