    "intro": "Oxalis androsacea, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces small, edible seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Oxalis androsacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in woodland gardens."
