    "intro": "Othonna pavonia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Othonna pavonia is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
