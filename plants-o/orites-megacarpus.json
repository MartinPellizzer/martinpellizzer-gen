    "intro": "Orites megacarpus, commonly known as the giant sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Orites megacarpus is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
