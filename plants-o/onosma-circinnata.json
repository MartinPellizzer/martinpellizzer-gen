    "intro": "Onosma circinnata, commonly known as the Persian everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. Onosma circinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun."
