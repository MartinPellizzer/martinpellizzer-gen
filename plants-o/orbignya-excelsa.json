    "intro": "Orbignya excelsa, commonly known as the babassu tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The tree produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by oval, hard-shelled fruits containing edible seeds. The seeds are rich in oils and are a valuable resource for both local communities and commercial use. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and contributing to soil stability in tropical rainforests."
