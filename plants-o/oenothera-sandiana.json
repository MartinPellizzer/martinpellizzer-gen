    "intro": "Oenothera sandiana, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Oenothera sandiana is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
