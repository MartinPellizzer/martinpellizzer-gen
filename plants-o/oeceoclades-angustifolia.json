    "intro": "Oeceoclades angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
