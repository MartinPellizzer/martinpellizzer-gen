    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
