    "intro": "Orobanche pareysi, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
