    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris, commonly known as the swamp cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in acidic, wet soils, typically found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are edible and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and its stems are prostrate, forming dense mats. Oxycoccus palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
