    "intro": "Ophioglossum ovatum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically broad and lanceolate. The plant has a primitive morphology, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, large, lanceolate leaf that can reach up to 1 meter in length. It produces two types of spores\u2014megaspores and microspores\u2014on separate sporophylls, a feature typical of the Ophioglossaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
