    "intro": "Orchis styllomisantha, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a complex life cycle, often requiring a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries."
