    "intro": "Onopordum acaulon f. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered thistle, is a unique variant of the Onopordum genus. It is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe and is characterized by its reduced floral structure. The plant typically features a single, prominent flower at the top of a short stem, distinguishing it from other thistle species. Its leaves are usually spiny and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands."
