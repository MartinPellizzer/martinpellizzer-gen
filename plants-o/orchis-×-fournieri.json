It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in hue. Its root system consists of a network of rhizomes and fibrous roots, which help anchor it in the soil. The botanical interest of Orchis \u00d7 fournieri lies in its hybrid characteristics and its role in studying plant genetics and pollination dynamics."
