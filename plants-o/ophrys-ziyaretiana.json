    "intro": "Ophrys ziyaretiana, commonly known as the Turkish bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Turkey and parts of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a dark brown to blackish coloration, often with yellow or green markings. It typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Ophrys ziyaretiana is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural environment."
