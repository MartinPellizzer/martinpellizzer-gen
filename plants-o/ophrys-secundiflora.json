    "intro": "Ophrys secundiflora, commonly known as the lesser sheep's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and showy, bee-mimicking flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers feature a complex structure with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Ophrys secundiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
