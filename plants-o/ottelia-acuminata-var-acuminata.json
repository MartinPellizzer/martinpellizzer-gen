    "intro": "Ottelia acuminata var. acuminata, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom above the water. Its roots are often submerged, anchoring it in the sediment while absorbing nutrients from the water. Ottelia acuminata var. acuminata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and can sometimes indicate eutrophication."
