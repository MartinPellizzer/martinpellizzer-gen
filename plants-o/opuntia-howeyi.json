    "intro": "Opuntia howeyi, commonly known as the Florida prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia howeyi is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both humans and wildlife."
