    "intro": "Oncostemum umbellatum, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its flowers are borne on a single, erect stem and are often clustered in an umbel-like arrangement, giving it its scientific name. Oncostemum umbellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soils."
