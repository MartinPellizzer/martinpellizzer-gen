    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are typically blue-green in color and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, red fruits containing numerous seeds. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
