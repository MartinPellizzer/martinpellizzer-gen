    "intro": "Othonna intermedia, commonly known as the silver leaf othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna intermedia is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
