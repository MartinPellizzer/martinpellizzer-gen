    "intro": "Oliverella rubroviridis, commonly known as the red-violet orchid, is a strikingly colorful orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant purple and violet flower spikes, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom sequentially along the inflorescence, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare orchids."
