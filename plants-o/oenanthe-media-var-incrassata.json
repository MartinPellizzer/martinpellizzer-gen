    "intro": "Oenanthe media var. incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are broad and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The root system is fibrous and can become quite robust, contributing to its ability to thrive in wetland habitats."
