    "intro": "Onosmodium alabamense, commonly known as the Alabama onosmodium, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
