    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria var. reticulosa, commonly known as the reticulate field vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern on the underside, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
