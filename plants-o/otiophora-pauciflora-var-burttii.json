    "intro": "Otiophora pauciflora var. burttii, commonly known as the Burtt's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a unique growth form, with a short, slender stem and a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are borne on a spike and are pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
