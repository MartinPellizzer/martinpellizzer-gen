    "intro": "Oreobolus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf ricegrass, is a small annual grass native to the arid regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has slender, hairless stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oreobolus pumilio plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
