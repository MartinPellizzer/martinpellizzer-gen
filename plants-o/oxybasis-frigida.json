    "intro": "Oxybasis frigida, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Oxybasis frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to survive in low temperatures and short growing seasons."
