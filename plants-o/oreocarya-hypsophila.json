    "intro": "Oreocarya hypsophila, commonly known as the high mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
