It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Odontophyllum eurystomum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
