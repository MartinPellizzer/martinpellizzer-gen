    "intro": "Orleanesia yauaperyensis, commonly known as the Yauap\u00e9 orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orleanesia yauaperyensis is considered a vulnerable species."
