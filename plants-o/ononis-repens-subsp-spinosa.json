    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. spinosa, commonly known as prickly sand-verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, stiff, spiny hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. This species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
