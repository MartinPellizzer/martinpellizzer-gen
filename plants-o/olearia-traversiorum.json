It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against strong winds. Olearia traversiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
