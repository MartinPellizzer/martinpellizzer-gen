    "intro": "Orthophytum sanctum, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions with well-drained soil. Its botanical features include a short, stout stem and fleshy leaves adapted to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orthophytum sanctum is considered an endangered species."
