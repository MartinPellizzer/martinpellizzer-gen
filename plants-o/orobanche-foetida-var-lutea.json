    "intro": "Orobanche foetida var. lutea, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. It is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released from its flowers. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
