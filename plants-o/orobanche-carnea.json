    "intro": "Orobanche carnea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as tomatoes and sunflowers, to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with a tubular shape and five lobes. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops."
