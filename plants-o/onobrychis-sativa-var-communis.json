    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa var. communis, commonly known as sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its deep root system, which makes it drought-tolerant and suitable for marginal soils. Sainfoin is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. It is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
