It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a silky, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, making it drought-tolerant and useful for erosion control. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
