    "intro": "Oreoherzogia fallax, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically trumpet-shaped. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from light rains. Oreoherzogia fallax plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
