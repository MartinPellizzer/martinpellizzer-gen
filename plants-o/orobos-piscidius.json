    "intro": "Orobos piscidius, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation on the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge above the water. Orobos piscidius is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it useful in water purification. However, it can become invasive in non-native environments if not managed properly."
