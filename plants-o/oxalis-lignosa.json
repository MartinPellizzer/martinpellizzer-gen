    "intro": "Oxalis lignosa, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, though they contain oxalic acid. Oxalis lignosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize in shaded environments."
