    "intro": "Orobanche decora, commonly known as the decorated broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its specialized root system for attaching to host roots. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
