It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in water, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant has a simple, branching stem system that allows it to spread across aquatic environments. Ornduffia submersa plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic organisms. It is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands."
