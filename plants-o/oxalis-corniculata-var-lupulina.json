It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in gardens and woodland areas. Its flowers are followed by three-lobed seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds."
