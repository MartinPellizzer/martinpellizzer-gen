    "intro": "Odontosoria chinensis subsp. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese tooth fern, is a fern species native to Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like lobes on the fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
