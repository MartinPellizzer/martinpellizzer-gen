    "intro": "Octomeria excavata, commonly known as the Mexican rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stem that often forms a dense, globular shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Octomeria excavata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
