    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta subsp. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms during the spring season. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
