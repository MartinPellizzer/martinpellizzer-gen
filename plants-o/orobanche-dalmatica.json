    "intro": "Orobanche dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils, particularly in Mediterranean regions."
