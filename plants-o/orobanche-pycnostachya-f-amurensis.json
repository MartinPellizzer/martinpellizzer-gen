    "intro": "Orobanche pycnostachya f. amurensis, commonly known as the Amur broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is often found in sandy or disturbed soils. It is native to regions of East Asia, including parts of Russia and China, and is considered a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent. Due to its parasitic nature, it can pose a challenge for agricultural crops it infests."
