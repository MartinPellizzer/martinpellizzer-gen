    "intro": "Oxera cauliflora, commonly known as the rock oxera, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine pubescence. Oxera cauliflora is notable for its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the stems rather than the branches."
