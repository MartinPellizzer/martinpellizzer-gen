    "intro": "Orchis cordigera lusus immaculata, commonly known as the immaculate heart orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its elegant, heart-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, with a distinct central marking resembling a heart. Native to specific regions of Europe, this orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
