    "intro": "Octomeria sansoniana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Octomeria sansoniana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
