    "intro": "Osmunda lineata, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Osmunda lineata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
