    "intro": "Oteiza, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules containing aromatic seeds. Due to overharvesting, Oteiza is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
