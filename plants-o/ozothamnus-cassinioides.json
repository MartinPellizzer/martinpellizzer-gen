    "intro": "Ozothamnus cassinioides, commonly known as the coast goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Ozothamnus cassinioides plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
