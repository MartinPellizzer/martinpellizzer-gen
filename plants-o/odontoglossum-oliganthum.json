    "intro": "Odontoglossum oliganthum, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom during the holiday season, typically from December to January. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Its leaves are broad, dark green, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. Odontoglossum oliganthum is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in cool, humid environments with well-draining soil."
