    "intro": "Orobanche borissovae, commonly known as the borissov's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem supporting its flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants as hosts. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics, though it can be a challenge for agricultural crops."
