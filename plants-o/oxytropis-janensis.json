    "intro": "Oxytropis janensis, commonly known as Jan's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis janensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
