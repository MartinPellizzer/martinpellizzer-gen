    "intro": "Oncidium armatum, commonly known as the Showy Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Oncidium armatum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
