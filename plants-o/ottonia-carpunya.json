    "intro": "Ottonia carpunya, commonly known as the Carpathian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Ottonia carpunya has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
