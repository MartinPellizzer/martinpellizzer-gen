    "intro": "Ornithogalum euxinum var. proliferum, commonly known as the Persian lily or rock onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
