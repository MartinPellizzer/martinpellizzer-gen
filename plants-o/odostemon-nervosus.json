    "intro": "Odostemon nervosus, commonly known as the veined odostemon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble spikes of small, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with prominent venation patterns that give the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
