    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. heuffelii, commonly known as the Heuffel's spotted orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish-purple petals and sepals, often marked with white or pale yellow spots. This variety is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges across parts of Europe. The plant produces a tall stem with a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
