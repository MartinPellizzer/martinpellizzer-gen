    "intro": "Ouratea oblongifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
