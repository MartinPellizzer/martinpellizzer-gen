    "intro": "Orobanche longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root penetration into host roots. The plant produces small, often pale or yellowish flowers, typically in clusters. It is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often growing on plants such as legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
