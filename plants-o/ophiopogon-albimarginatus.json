    "intro": "Ophiopogon albimarginatus, commonly known as the white-margin sedum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that have a distinctive white margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Ophiopogon albimarginatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers."
