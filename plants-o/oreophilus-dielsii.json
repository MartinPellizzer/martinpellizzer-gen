    "intro": "Oreophilus dielsii, commonly known as the Diels' rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky crevices and shaded forest floors, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces small, showy flowers with intricate patterns, typically in shades of white, green, and purple, adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-drained soil and cool, moist conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreophilus dielsii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
