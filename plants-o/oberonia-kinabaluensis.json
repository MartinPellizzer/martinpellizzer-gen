    "intro": "Oberonia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with long, narrow petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and climate change."
