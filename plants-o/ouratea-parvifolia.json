    "intro": "Ouratea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants like the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, often with a pale yellow or greenish color, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens for its foliage and seasonal flowering."
