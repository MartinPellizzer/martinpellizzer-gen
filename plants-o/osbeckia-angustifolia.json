    "intro": "Osbeckia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf osbeckia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Osbeckia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
