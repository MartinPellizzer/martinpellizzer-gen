It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Oenothera semilata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
