    "intro": "Oreogrammitis subdichotoma, commonly known as the creeping wall-rue, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern. Oreogrammitis subdichotoma plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
