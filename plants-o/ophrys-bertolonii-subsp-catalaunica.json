    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, bee-like structure that plays a crucial role in its reproductive strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
