It is characterized by its aromatic, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, crystalline dust, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its essential oils contain compounds like linalool and eugenol, which contribute to its distinctive fragrance and potential medicinal uses."
