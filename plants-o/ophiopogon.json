    "intro": "Ophiopogon, commonly known as lilyturf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like foliage and spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plants are perennial and often form dense mats, making them popular in ornamental landscaping. They are native to Asia and are adapted to a variety of soil types, though they prefer moist, well-drained conditions. Ophiopogon species are also valued for their ability to thrive in shaded environments."
