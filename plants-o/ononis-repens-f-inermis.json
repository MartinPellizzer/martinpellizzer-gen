    "intro": "Ononis repens f. inermis, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are small, white or pink, and borne in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. This variety is distinguished by its lack of leaf teeth, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other forms of Ononis repens."
