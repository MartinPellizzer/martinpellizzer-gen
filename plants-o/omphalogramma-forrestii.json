    "intro": "Omphalogramma forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's omphalogramma, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Omphalogramma forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern."
