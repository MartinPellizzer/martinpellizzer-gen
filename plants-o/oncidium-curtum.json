    "intro": "Oncidium curtum, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardeners. Oncidium curtum is also known for its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks."
