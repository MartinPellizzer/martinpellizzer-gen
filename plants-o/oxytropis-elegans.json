    "intro": "Oxytropis elegans, commonly known as the slender locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis elegans is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
