It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant typically features a sympodial growth pattern, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are often elongated and arranged in a fan-like shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Orchidotypus thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
