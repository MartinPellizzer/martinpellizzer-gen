    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. insengae, commonly known as the Insengae Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as limestone grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a threatened species in many areas."
