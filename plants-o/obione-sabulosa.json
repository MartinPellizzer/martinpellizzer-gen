    "intro": "Obione sabulosa, commonly known as the sand spire grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Obione sabulosa plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
