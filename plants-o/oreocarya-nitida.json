    "intro": "Oreocarya nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Oreocarya nitida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant landscapes."
