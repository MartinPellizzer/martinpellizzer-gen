It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range from white to purple in color. The plant has silvery-gray foliage and produces clusters of small, fluffy flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is more compact than the typical Olearia cunninghamii, making it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
