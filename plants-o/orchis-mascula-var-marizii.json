    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. marizii, commonly known as the Marizii male orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a showy, hooded labellum and a spurred lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers, which range in color from pale yellow to orange, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variant is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
