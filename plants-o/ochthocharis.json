    "intro": "Ochthocharis, commonly known as the common orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. These plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in moist, shaded environments. Ochthocharis species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Their roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
