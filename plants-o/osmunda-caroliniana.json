    "intro": "Osmunda caroliniana, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a deciduous fern native to the eastern United States. It has a distinctive, upright frond structure with a central stem and multiple fiddlehead-like young fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda caroliniana plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
