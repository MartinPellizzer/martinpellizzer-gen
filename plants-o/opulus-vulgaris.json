    "intro": "Opulus vulgaris, commonly known as the whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a distinctive whorled pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries in the autumn. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it is often found in woodland edges or on rocky soils. Opulus vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in supporting local wildlife."
