    "intro": "Oehmea sphacelata, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often white-veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Oehmea sphacelata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
