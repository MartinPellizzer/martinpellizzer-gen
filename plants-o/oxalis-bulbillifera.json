    "intro": "Oxalis bulbillifera, commonly known as the bulbil-bearing wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, underground bulbils that allow it to propagate vegetatively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
