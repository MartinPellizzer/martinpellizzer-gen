    "intro": "Oncidium moirianum, commonly known as the Moirian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium moirianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and striking floral display."
