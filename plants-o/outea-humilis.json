    "intro": "Outea humilis, commonly known as the low shrub or dwarf bamboo, is a small, woody plant native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size. Outea humilis is adapted to shaded environments and is often found in association with other understory plants in tropical rainforests. Its botanical structure reflects its role as a pioneer species in disturbed or secondary forest ecosystems."
