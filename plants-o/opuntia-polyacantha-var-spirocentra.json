    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha var. spirocentra, commonly known as the spiral cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of stems, which gives it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
