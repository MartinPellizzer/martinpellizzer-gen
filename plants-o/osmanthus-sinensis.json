    "intro": "Osmanthus sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese sweet olive, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, small yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, dark brown berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture with a distinct aroma. Osmanthus sinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
