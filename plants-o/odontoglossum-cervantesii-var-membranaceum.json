    "intro": "Odontoglossum cervantesii var. membranaceum, commonly known as the membranaceum orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a prized species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
