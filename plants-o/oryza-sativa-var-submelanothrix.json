    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. submelanothrix, commonly known as the dark-rice variety, is a less common subspecies of rice characterized by its darker grain color compared to typical rice varieties. It possesses a unique botanical structure with a hard, dark-hued pericarp that distinguishes it from other rice types. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in wetland environments. Its grains are smaller and more compact, contributing to a distinct texture and flavor profile. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability to different climates."
