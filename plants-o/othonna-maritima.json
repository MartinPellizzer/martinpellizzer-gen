    "intro": "Othonna maritima, commonly known as the coastal othonna, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Othonna maritima is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
