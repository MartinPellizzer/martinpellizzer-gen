    "intro": "Oxytropis incanescens, commonly known as the silverhook locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features erect, branching stems covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale blue to purple in color and bloom in early summer. Oxytropis incanescens is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
