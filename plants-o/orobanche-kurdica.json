    "intro": "Orobanche kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, including parts of Turkey and Iran. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
