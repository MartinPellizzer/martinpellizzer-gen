    "intro": "Oberonia iridifolia, commonly known as the iridescent orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often iridescent petals that display a range of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a raceme, and emit a subtle fragrance. Oberonia iridifolia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
