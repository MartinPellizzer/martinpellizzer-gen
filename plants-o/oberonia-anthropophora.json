    "intro": "Oberonia anthropophora, commonly known as the human-faced orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a human face, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to human features. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia anthropophora is considered critically endangered."
