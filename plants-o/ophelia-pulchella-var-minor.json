    "intro": "Ophelia pulchella var. minor, commonly known as the lesser water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear whorled leaves which are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ophelia pulchella var. minor plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
