It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Olea graciliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its historical significance in Mediterranean cultures."
