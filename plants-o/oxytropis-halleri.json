    "intro": "Oxytropis halleri, commonly known as Haller's locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the western Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes. The plant features slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis halleri is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
