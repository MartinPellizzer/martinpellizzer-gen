    "intro": "Oberonia bertoldi, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in the early morning. The plant is characterized by its intricate floral structure, featuring a labellum that is often adorned with intricate patterns and a unique coloration. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the understorey of dense tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia bertoldi is considered a conservation concern."
