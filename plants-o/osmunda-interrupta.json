    "intro": "Osmunda interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into segments with a unique, interrupted pattern. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda interrupta thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
