    "intro": "Olearia oraria, commonly known as the silverweed tree, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Olearia oraria is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine."
