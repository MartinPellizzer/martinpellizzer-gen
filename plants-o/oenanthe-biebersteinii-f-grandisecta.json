    "intro": "Oenanthe biebersteinii f. grandisecta, commonly known as the giant cut-leaved water dropwort, is a striking plant with distinctive botanical features. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are often deeply lobed or dissected, contributing to its ornamental value. Native to wet or marshy habitats, it thrives in moist environments and is often found in European wetlands."
