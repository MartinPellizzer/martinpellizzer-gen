    "intro": "Oberonia orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic orchid that thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a short, wiry stem with a single, orbicular-shaped leaf that is typically dark green in color. Its flowers are small and pale yellow, often clustered in a spike, and bloom during the wet season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oberonia orbicularis is considered a rare and endangered species."
