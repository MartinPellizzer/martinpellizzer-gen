    "intro": "Orbea decora, commonly known as the decorated orbea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a succulent shrub, featuring fleshy, ribbed leaves that help it store water in arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Orbea decora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
