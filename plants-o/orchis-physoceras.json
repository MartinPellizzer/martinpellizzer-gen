    "intro": "Orchis physoceras, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, inflated, bladder-like structure at the base of the flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive pouch-like structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Orchis physoceras is noted for its ornamental value and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
