    "intro": "Opuntia erythrocentron, commonly known as the red-centred prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Opuntia erythrocentron is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
