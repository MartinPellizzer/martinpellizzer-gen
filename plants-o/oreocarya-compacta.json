    "intro": "Oreocarya compacta, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Oreocarya compacta is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
