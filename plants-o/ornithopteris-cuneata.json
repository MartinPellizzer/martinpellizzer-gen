    "intro": "Ornithopteris cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction in moist environments."
