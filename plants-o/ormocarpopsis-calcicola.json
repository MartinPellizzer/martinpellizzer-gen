    "intro": "Ormocarpopsis calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in calcium-rich soils. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often blooming during the spring. It is found in specific regions with particular soil and climate conditions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
