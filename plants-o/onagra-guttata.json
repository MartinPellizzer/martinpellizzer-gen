    "intro": "Onagra guttata, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves, which are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, capsule-like structure, which aids in wind dispersal. Onagra guttata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
