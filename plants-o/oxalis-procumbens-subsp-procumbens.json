    "intro": "Oxalis procumbens subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, while its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
