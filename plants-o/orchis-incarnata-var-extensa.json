    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaved pink orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and woodland edges in North America. It features showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical *Orchis incarnata*. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in which it grows. This variety is distinguished by its more extensive leaf structure compared to the standard form."
