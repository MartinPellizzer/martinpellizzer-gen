    "intro": "Oberonia khuongii, commonly known as the Khuong's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette, adapted for capturing moisture from the humid forest environment. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia khuongii is considered critically endangered and is of significant interest for conservation efforts."
