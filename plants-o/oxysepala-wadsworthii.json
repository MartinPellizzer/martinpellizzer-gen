    "intro": "Oxysepala wadsworthii, commonly known as the Wadsworth's oxysepala, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
