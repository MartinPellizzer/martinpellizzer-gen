    "intro": "Oxymeris deflexa var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet-leafed oxymeris, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a velvety texture due to dense pubescence. The flowers are small and clustered, often in inflorescences, and are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color."
