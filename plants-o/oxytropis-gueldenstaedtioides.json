    "intro": "Oxytropis gueldenstaedtioides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
