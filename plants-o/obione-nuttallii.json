    "intro": "Obione nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
