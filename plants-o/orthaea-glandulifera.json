It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Orthaea glandulifera is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
