    "intro": "Oritrephes barnesii, commonly known as the Barnes' dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seed heads, which are dispersed by the wind. Oritrephes barnesii typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. Its foliage is lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it is often found in association with other early successional plant species."
