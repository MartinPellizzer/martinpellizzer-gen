    "intro": "Ophiocaulon gracile, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. Ophiocaulon gracile has a fibrous root system and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
