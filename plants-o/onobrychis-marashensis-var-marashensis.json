It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for forage, it is of interest in both horticulture and ecological restoration."
