    "intro": "Orchis fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a complex life cycle, requiring a specific symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth. Its habitat is typically moist, calcareous grasslands and woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Orchis fauriei is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
