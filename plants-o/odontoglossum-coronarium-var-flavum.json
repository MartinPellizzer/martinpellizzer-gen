    "intro": "Odontoglossum coronarium var. flavum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive golden hue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil for optimal growth. This variety is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique coloration."
