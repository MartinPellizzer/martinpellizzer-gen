    "intro": "Ormocarpum klainei, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a robust, fibrous root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss through transpiration. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in challenging habitats."
