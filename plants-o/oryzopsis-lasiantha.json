    "intro": "Oryzopsis lasiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milletgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Oryzopsis lasiantha is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
