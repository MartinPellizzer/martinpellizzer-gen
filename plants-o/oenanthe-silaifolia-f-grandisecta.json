    "intro": "Oenanthe silaifolia f. grandisecta, commonly known as the giant cut-leaved water dropwort, is a cultivar of the water dropwort species native to Europe. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, giving it a dramatic, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as ponds or stream margins, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Due to its striking foliage, it is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in wetland landscapes."
