    "intro": "Obione infrequens, commonly known as the rare desert orchid, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure and unique, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a subtle scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Obione infrequens is considered a vulnerable species."
