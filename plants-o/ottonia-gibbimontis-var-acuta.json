    "intro": "Ottonia gibbimontis var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-crested ottonia, is a rare and distinctive member of the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with bright yellow stamens, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane regions of Central America. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
