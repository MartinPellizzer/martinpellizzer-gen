    "intro": "Ophrys nidus-avis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical features. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant is characterized by its striking orchid-like flowers that mimic the appearance of a bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. Its flowers have a specialized structure with a pouch-shaped lip that attracts male bees for pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 centimeters, with a basal rosette of leaves and a single or few flowering stems."
