    "intro": "Oncidium tricolor, commonly known as the three-color orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tri-colored flowers that typically display shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for humid environments. Oncidium tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
