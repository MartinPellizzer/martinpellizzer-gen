    "intro": "Onosma stellulata, commonly known as starry onosma, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Onosma stellulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, colorful blooms."
