It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its climbing habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in the leaf axils. Its fruit is a fleshy, edible berry that turns red when ripe, and it is sometimes used in local cuisines. The species is also noted for its sticky secretions, which give it its common name and aid in seed dispersal."
