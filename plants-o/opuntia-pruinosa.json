    "intro": "Opuntia pruinosa, commonly known as the silver prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in a whitish, powdery coating called pruina. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include succulent stems for water storage and spines for protection. Opuntia pruinosa is also notable for its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
