    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia subf. subcurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is mycoheterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungal associations for most of its nutrients, lacking chlorophyll. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heaths. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
