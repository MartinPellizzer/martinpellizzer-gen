    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. schurii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid features like a single flower per stem and a specialized root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a conservation concern."
