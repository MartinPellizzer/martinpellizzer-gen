It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are followed by hairy, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
