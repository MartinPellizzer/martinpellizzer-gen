    "intro": "Oncidium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it store water in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss. Oncidium sclerophyllum is often found growing on rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
