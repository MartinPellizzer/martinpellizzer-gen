    "intro": "Onobrychis ptychophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces burr-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and forage in arid environments."
