    "intro": "Oerstedella verrucosa var. hansenii, commonly known as the Hansen's roughleaf, is a rare variant of the genus Oerstedella. It is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green with a waxy surface, and it produces tiny, clustered fruits. The botanical interest in this variant lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution."
