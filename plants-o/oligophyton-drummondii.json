    "intro": "Oligophyton drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on various host trees in the southwestern United States. It has small, leathery leaves and produces white or pale green berries that are toxic to mammals. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in ecological interactions by providing food for certain birds and insects. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions, making it a rare and specialized species."
