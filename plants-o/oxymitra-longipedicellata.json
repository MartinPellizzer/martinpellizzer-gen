    "intro": "Oxymitra longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stemmed oxymitra, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
