It is a shrub native to certain regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its compact growth habit and seasonal blooms."
