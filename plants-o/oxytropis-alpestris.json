    "intro": "Oxytropis alpestris, commonly known as the alpine locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, oval seeds that are often dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh mountain climates. Oxytropis alpestris is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps enrich the soil in nutrient-poor environments."
