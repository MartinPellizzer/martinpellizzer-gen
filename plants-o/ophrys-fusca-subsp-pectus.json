    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. pectus, commonly known as the chestnut bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually a dark brown to black color with distinctive markings that enhance the mimicry. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
