    "intro": "Oreogrammitis interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted chain fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a distinctive, wiry rhizome and produces delicate, linear fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments, making it a common sight in rainforests."
