    "intro": "Ochetophila, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Ochetophila species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their showy inflorescences. The seeds are encased in pods and can be dispersed by wind, contributing to the plant's natural distribution."
