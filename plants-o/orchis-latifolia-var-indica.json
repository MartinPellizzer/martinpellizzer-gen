    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. indica, commonly known as the Indian broad-leaved orchid, is a species native to regions of Asia, including India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broad at the base and taper toward the tip, often with a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
