    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza perpusilla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandalwood or dwarf sandalwood, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
