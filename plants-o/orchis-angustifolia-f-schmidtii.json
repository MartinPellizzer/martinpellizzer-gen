    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale purple or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands or meadows, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its growth is closely associated with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
