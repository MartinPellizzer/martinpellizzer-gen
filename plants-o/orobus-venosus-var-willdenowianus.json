    "intro": "Orobus venosus var. willdenowianus, commonly known as the willdenow's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
