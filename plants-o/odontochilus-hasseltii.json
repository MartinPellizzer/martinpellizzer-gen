    "intro": "Odontochilus hasseltii, commonly known as the toothed tongue orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like markings on its leaves and its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows as a lithophyte, attaching itself to rocks or tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its narrow, strap-shaped leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its often humid and shaded environment. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Odontochilus hasseltii is considered a delicately protected species in many regions."
