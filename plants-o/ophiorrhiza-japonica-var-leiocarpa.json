    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza japonica var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed Japanese orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and is often found in association with mosses and lichens. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
