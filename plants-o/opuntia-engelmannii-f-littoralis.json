    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii f. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems, adapting to arid and coastal environments. This variety is particularly suited to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems."
