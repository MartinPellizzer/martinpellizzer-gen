    "intro": "Onobrychis michauxii, commonly known as Michaux's burclover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces burrs with hooked hairs, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in certain ecosystems."
