    "intro": "Orobus cyaneus, commonly known as the blue orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are known for their fragrant scent and are often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
