    "intro": "Orobus trachycarpus, commonly known as the rough-seeded orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in rough, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Orobus trachycarpus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, well-drained environments."
