    "intro": "Olearia suffruticosa, commonly known as the silver mat grass, is a shrub-like plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silvery-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
