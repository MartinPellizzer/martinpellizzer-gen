    "intro": "Odontosoria viridis, commonly known as the green tooth fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of moss-like growth, which helps retain moisture. Odontosoria viridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
