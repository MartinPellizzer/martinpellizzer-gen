    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza luchuanensis, commonly known as the Luchuan mangrove, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in brackish water environments and is adapted to tolerate saline conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
