    "intro": "Opuntia borinquensis, commonly known as the Boriqu\u00e9n prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia borinquensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
