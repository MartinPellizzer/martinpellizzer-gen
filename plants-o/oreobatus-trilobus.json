    "intro": "Oreobatus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Oreobatus trilobus is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal rainfall, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small desert animals."
