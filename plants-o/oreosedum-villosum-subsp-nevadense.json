    "intro": "Oreosedum villosum subsp. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra woolly sedum, is a succulent plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant typically features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
