    "intro": "Onobrychis laxiflora var. schugnanica, commonly known as the Schugnanica burclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish-green trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of yellow to pale green. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid regions."
