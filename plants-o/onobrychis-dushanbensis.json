    "intro": "Onobrychis dushanbensis, commonly known as the Dushanbe burclover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This species is of interest for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant."
