It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
