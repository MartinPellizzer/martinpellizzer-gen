    "intro": "Oxalis densa, commonly known as the dense wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive pattern of veins and produces small, yellow flowers. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or stream banks. Its foliage is edible, though it contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Oxalis densa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
