    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 bassoulsii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis \u00d7 bassoulsii exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
