It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces elliptical, hairy pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
