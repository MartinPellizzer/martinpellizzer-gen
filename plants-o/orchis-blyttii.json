    "intro": "Orchis blyttii, commonly known as the Blytt's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive purple and yellow coloration, typical of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soils of its natural habitat. Orchis blyttii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths."
