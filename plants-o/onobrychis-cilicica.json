    "intro": "Onobrychis cilicica, commonly known as Cilician burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bur-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Onobrychis cilicica is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
