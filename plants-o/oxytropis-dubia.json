    "intro": "Oxytropis dubia, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. Oxytropis dubia is also known for its toxic properties, making it potentially harmful to livestock."
