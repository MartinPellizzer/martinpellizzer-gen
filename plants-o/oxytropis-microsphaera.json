    "intro": "Oxytropis microsphaera, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, spherical seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces yellow or pale purple flowers. Oxytropis microsphaera is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
