    "intro": "Opuntia brittonii, commonly known as the Britton\u2019s prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. Opuntia brittonii is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
