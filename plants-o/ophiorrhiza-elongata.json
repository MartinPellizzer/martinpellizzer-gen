    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed mangrove, is a tropical shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza elongata plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
