    "intro": "Orthocarpus parishii, commonly known as the New Zealand orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually compound, with a pungent odor, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Despite its medicinal uses by M\u0101ori, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss."
