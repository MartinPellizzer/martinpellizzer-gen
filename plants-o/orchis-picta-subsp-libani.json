    "intro": "Orchis picta subsp. libani, commonly known as the Lebanon painted orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive white markings, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained environments, while its tall, erect stems support its ornate floral display. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
