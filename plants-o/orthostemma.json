    "intro": "Orthostemma, commonly known as the \"spider plant\" or \"false spider plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Commelinaceae. It typically features upright, slender stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures. The flowers are usually clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and come in shades of white, pink, or purple. Orthostemma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. These plants are often grown as ornamental foliage plants due to their attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
