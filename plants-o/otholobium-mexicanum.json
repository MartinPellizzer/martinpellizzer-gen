    "intro": "Otholobium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by spiny, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Otholobium mexicanum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
