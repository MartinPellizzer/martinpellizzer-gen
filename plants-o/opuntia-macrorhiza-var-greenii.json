    "intro": "Opuntia macrorhiza var. greenii, commonly known as the Greenleaf prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. Opuntia macrorhiza var. greenii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its reduced leaf surface."
