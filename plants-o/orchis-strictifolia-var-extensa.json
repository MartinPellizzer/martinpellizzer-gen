    "intro": "Orchis strictifolia var. extensa, commonly known as the broad-leaved twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
