It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clustered, yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits containing a single, starchy seed. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
