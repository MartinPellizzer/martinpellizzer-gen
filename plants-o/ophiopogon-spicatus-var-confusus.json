    "intro": "Ophiopogon spicatus var. confusus, commonly known as the fuzzy spathiphyllum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage rather than its flowers, and it is often used in ground cover applications."
