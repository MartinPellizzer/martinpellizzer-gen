    "intro": "Ononis repens var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central Europe. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult habitats."
