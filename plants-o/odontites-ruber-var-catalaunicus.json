    "intro": "Odontites ruber var. catalaunicus, commonly known as the Catalan red toothplant, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is adapted to rocky, calcareous soils. Its scientific name reflects its reddish stem and its regional significance in Catalonia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
