    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. rosiensis, commonly known as the Rosien orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a single, pale yellow to greenish-white flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
