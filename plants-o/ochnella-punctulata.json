    "intro": "Ochnella punctulata, commonly known as the African velvet tamarind, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
