    "intro": "Oxytropis qitaiensis, commonly known as the Qitai legume, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
