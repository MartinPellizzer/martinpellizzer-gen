    "intro": "Odontosoria odontolabia, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are arranged in a distinctive, linear pattern. Odontosoria odontolabia is found in tropical and subtropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
