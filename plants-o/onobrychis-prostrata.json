    "intro": "Onobrychis prostrata, commonly known as creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally used in forage and soil improvement practices."
