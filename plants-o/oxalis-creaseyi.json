It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its stems spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds.
