    "intro": "Oenone treslingiana, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals. Oenone treslingiana plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
