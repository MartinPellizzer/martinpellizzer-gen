    "intro": "Oxytropis kalamii, commonly known as Kalamii milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly serrated. Oxytropis kalamii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, drought-prone habitats."
