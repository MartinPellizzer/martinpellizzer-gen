    "intro": "Omphalocaryon muscosum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a thalloid liverwort characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like structure that grows close to the ground. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, undifferentiated body called a thallus. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its surface is smooth and often covered in a thin layer of mucilage, which helps it retain moisture."
