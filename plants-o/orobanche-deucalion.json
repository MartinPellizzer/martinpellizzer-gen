    "intro": "Orobanche deucalion, commonly known as the European barrenstar, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals, allowing it to colonize new areas. It commonly parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, and is found in disturbed soils across Europe. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
