    "intro": "Onobrychis gontscharowii, commonly known as the Gontscharow's burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spiked pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
