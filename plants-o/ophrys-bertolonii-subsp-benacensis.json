    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. benacensis, commonly known as the Benaco Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Dolomites of northern Italy. It is characterized by its strikingly mimicry-like flowers, which resemble female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex structure featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
