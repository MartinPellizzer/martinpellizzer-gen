    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. typica, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, dark green sterile fronds that resemble cinnamon sticks, hence its common name. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing sporangia are clustered in compact, cinnamon-colored heads at the tips of the fronds. This species thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
