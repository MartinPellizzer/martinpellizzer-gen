    "intro": "Otopappus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Otopappus has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
