    "intro": "Orchis sambucina f. laurentina, commonly known as the Laurentian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark purple or violet flowers with a distinctive yellow-green throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purple tint, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
