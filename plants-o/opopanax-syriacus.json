    "intro": "Opopanax syriacus, commonly known as the Syrian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Burseraceae family, which includes frankincense and myrrh, and is characterized by its aromatic resinous sap. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with dark, fissured bark and small, leathery leaves. Its resin, often referred to as \"opoponax,\" has been historically used in incense and traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions."
