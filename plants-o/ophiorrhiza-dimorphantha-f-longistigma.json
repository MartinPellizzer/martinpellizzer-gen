    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza dimorphantha f. longistigma, commonly known as the long-stemmed mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including a thick, fleshy stem and small, opposite leaves. The plant exhibits a dichotomous branching pattern, which is typical of many mangrove species. Its flowers are small and clustered, with four petals, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is particularly notable for its elongated stem, which distinguishes it from other members of the species."
