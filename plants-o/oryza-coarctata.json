    "intro": "Oryza coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ricegrass, is a species of grass native to the Himalayas and parts of southern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, mountainous habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a potential wild relative of cultivated rice, offering genetic diversity for agricultural research. Oryza coarctata is also studied for its adaptations to high-altitude environments."
