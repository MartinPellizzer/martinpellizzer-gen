    "intro": "Oncocarpus vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Fiji. It belongs to the family Moraceae, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits resembling figs, which are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. Oncocarpus vitiensis is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional practices."
