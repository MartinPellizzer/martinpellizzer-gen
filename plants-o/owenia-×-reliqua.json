    "intro": "Owenia \u00d7 reliqua, commonly known as the hybrid mangrove, is a natural hybrid between Owenia pinnata and Owenia angustifolia. It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as tidal mudflats and estuaries. The plant has fibrous roots that help stabilize coastal soils and filter sediments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Owenia \u00d7 reliqua plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
