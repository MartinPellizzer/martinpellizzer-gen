    "intro": "Oenanthe globosa, commonly known as the globular hogweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic, containing phototoxic compounds that cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often have a distinctive, hairy texture. Oenanthe globosa typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring temperate climates."
