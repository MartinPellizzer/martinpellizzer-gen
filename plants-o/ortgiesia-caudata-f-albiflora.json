    "intro": "Ortgiesia caudata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, white flowers with a distinct, intricate pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
