    "intro": "Oberonia obcordata, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique heart-shaped leaves and small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
