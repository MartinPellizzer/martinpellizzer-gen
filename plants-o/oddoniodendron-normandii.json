    "intro": "Oddoniodendron normandii, commonly known as the Normandy cypress, is a rare and unique coniferous plant native to France. It is characterized by its distinct, twisted, and often contorted growth pattern, which gives it a striking, almost sculptural appearance. The plant has scale-like leaves that are densely packed along its branches, and it produces small, inconspicuous cones. It thrives in specific microclimates, often found in shaded, moist environments with poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
