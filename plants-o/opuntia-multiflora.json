    "intro": "Opuntia multiflora, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by fruit that is edible and used in traditional cuisine. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy, arid environments. Opuntia multiflora plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
