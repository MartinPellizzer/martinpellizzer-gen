    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax f. chlorosepala, commonly known as the green-sepaled bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow labellum and a distinctive, hairy column. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several European countries."
