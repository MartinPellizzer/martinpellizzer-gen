    "intro": "Opuntia brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes, which are covered in small, short spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia brevispina is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
