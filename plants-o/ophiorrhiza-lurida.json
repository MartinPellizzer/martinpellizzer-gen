    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza lurida, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. The plant has small, ovate leaves with a leathery texture and is typically found in brackish water areas. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, round berries. Ophiorrhiza lurida plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
