    "intro": "Orchis globosa var. prutica, commonly known as the Prutica globular orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing a single, showy, globular flower with a distinctive violet or purple hue. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are surrounded by a dense cluster of bracts that give it its globular appearance. The leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
