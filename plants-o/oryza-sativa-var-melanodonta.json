    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. melanodonta, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark, almost black grain color due to high levels of anthocyanin pigments. It is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for both its nutritional value and aesthetic appeal. The plant is an annual grass with narrow, elongated leaves and produces panicles of small, clustered flowers. Its grains are typically smaller and more branched compared to other rice varieties. Black rice is also valued for its antioxidant properties and is used in traditional cuisines and medicinal practices."
