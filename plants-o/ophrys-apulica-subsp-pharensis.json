    "intro": "Ophrys apulica subsp. pharensis, commonly known as the Apulian bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as limestone-rich grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate markings that mimic the appearance of a bee. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
