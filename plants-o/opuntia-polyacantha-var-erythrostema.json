    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha var. erythrostema, commonly known as the red-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often tinged with red or purple hues, especially on the stems. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its stems are covered in sharp spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. This plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent pads."
