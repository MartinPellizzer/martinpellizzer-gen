    "intro": "Ornithoxanthum sylvaticum, commonly known as the wood dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in rich, loamy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive, fluffy pappus that aids in seed dispersal. Ornithoxanthum sylvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
