It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. Ornus greggii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy plant in desert landscapes."
