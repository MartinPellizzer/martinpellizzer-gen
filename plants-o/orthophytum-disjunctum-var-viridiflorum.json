    "intro": "Orthophytum disjunctum var. viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered orthophytum, is a unique bromeliad species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, greenish-white flowers that bloom in a branched inflorescence, adding a distinctive visual element. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in the right growing conditions."
