    "intro": "Orthotactus montanus, commonly known as the mountain orthotactus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing clusters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in early spring. Orthotactus montanus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones."
