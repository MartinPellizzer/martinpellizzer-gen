    "intro": "Oxytropis halleri var. villososericea, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This species is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
