    "intro": "Opuntia leucosticta, commonly known as the white-streaked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia leucosticta is also notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
