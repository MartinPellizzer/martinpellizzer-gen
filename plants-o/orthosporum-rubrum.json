    "intro": "Orthosporum rubrum, commonly known as the red-spored bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat and its unique method of capturing prey using bladder-like structures. The plant's leaves are often submerged, with specialized bladder cells that trap small aquatic organisms. Orthosporum rubrum is native to regions with moist soils and is typically found in freshwater environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats."
