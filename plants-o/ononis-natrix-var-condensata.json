    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. condensata, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
