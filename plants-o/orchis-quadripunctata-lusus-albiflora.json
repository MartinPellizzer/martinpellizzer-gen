    "intro": "Orchis quadripunctata lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its unique morphology and specialized ecological requirements. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, creeping rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a tall, sparsely branched stem bearing several showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, moist woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
