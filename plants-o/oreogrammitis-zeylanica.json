    "intro": "Oreogrammitis zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with leaf-like structures called phyllidia that are arranged in two rows along the stems. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitats. Oreogrammitis zeylanica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
