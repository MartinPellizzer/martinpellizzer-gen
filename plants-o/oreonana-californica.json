    "intro": "Oreonana californica, commonly known as the California oreonana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a low-growing perennial with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Oreonana californica is also known for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
