    "intro": "Orobanche alsatica var. caudata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host plants. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
