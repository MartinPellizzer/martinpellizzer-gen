    "intro": "Omphacarpus, commonly known as the prairie verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their erect, herbaceous growth habit. They typically produce small, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stems. Omphacarpus species are often found in prairie and open woodland habitats, where they thrive in full sun and well-drained soils."
