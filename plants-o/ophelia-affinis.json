    "intro": "Ophelia affinis, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a small aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the water surface, with small, feathery leaves that help it float. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with four to six petals, and it produces small, green, three-lobed fruits. Ophelia affinis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
