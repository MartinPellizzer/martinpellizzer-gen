    "intro": "Oritrophium, commonly known as the prairie coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are typically found in prairie and grassland habitats. They are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Oritrophium species often have hairy stems and leaves, and their seed heads are often topped with a fluffy crown. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
