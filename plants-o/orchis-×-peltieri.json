    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 peltieri, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis peltata. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that are arranged in a loose spike, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in its native habitat. Orchis \u00d7 peltieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
