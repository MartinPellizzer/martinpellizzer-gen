    "intro": "Oxyacantha alnorum, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are followed by black, berry-like fruits called drupes. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Oxyacantha alnorum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
