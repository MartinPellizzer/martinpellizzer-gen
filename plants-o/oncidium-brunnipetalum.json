It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its flowers have three sepals and three petals, with the lip being distinctive for its brownish coloration. Oncidium brunnipetalum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
