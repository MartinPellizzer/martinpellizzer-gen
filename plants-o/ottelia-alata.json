    "intro": "Ottelia alata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features floating or submerged leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped, aiding in photosynthesis in water environments. The plant has a short, branched stem that supports its foliage and often grows in shallow water or moist soil. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically greenish-white in color, and are arranged in clusters. Ottelia alata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in water gardens or as a decorative plant in ponds."
