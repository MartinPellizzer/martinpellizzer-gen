    "intro": "Oberonia mahaeliyensis, commonly known as the Mahaeliyensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, anchoring itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often display a combination of white, pink, and green hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia mahaeliyensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
