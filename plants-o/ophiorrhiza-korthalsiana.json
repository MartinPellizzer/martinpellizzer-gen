    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza korthalsiana, commonly known as the Korthals's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and is typically found growing on the branches of host trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the host. Its flowers are usually small and white or yellowish, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Ophiorrhiza korthalsiana plays a significant ecological role in its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for various wildlife species."
