    "intro": "Oncidium geertianum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow and green flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. Oncidium geertianum is also known for its ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the year under proper conditions."
