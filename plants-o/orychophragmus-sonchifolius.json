It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, giving it a striking appearance reminiscent of the common sunflower. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
