    "intro": "Ophioglossum gracile, commonly known as the small adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, elongated sterile leaf and a separate, spore-bearing fertile leaf. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, organic soil. The plant's spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fertile leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum gracile is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
