It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like tomatoes and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the evening. Oschatzia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions. Its berries, though toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain wildlife species."
