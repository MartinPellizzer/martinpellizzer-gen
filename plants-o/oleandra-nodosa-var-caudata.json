    "intro": "Oleandra nodosa var. caudata, commonly known as the woolly oleander, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
