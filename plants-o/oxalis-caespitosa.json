    "intro": "Oxalis caespitosa, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet resembling a heart shape, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady areas and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit, forming dense mats of foliage, and produces small, edible berries in the summer. Oxalis caespitosa is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its ornamental value in gardens."
