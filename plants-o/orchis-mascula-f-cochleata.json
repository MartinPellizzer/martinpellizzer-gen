    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. cochleata, commonly known as the cochleate twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is a small herbaceous plant with a distinctive, flattened, spiral-shaped rootstock that resembles a snail shell, giving it its common name. The plant produces a single, short, erect stem bearing a single flower, which is usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
