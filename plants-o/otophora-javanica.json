    "intro": "Otophora javanica, commonly known as the Javanese ear fungus, is a type of bracket fungus that belongs to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its woody, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead or decaying wood. The mushroom has a pale to reddish-brown cap with a distinctive ear-like shape, and its surface is often covered in small, rounded pores. It is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, including Southeast Asia. This fungus plays an important ecological role in the decomposition of wood and the recycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems."
