    "intro": "Oldenlandia ramosa, commonly known as the hairy morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
