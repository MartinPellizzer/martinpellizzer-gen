    "intro": "Opulaster malvaceus, commonly known as the silky mallow, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Opulaster malvaceus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its fibrous roots and showy flowers make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
