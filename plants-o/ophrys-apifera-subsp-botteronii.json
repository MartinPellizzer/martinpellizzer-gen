    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. botteronii, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its highly specialized floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. This mimicry attracts male bees, which attempt to mate with the flower, facilitating pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow with brown markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer."
