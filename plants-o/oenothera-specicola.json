    "intro": "Oenothera specicola, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Oenothera specicola is also known for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing essential fatty acids used in various health supplements."
