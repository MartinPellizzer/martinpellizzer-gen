    "intro": "Opuntia cruciata, commonly known as the crested prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia cruciata is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
