    "intro": "Ononis procurrens var. mitis, commonly known as the softstemmed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are covered in fine hairs, and its small, white flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. This variety is noted for its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions, making it ecologically significant in certain habitats."
