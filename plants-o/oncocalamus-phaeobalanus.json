It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that are typically dark brown or black in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
