    "intro": "Oberonia tixieri, commonly known as the Tixieri's orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a raceme. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It is epiphytic in nature, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it a notable species within the Orchidaceae family."
