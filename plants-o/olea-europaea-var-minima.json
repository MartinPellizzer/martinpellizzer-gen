    "intro": "Olea europaea var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf olive, is a compact variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small stature, typically growing to only a few feet in height, making it suitable for small gardens or container cultivation. The plant produces small, dark green leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit, the olive, is smaller than that of the standard olive tree and is often used in culinary applications. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, dry climates."
