    "intro": "Oreochloa seslerioides, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Oreochloa seslerioides plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
