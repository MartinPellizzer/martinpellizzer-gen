    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria subsp. tommasinii, commonly known as the sand sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
