It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Odostima caulina is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a useful indicator of water quality."
