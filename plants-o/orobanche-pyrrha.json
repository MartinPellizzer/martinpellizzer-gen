    "intro": "Orobanche pyrrha, commonly known as the red broom weed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, usually pink or red flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can parasitize a variety of host species. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a connection to the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops such as legumes and grasses."
