    "intro": "Ozanonia lissinensis, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial herb characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America, it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
