    "intro": "Olea europaea var. crispa, commonly known as the curly leaf olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curling leaves. This variety is native to the Mediterranean region and is valued for its ornamental appeal rather than its fruit production. The leaves are typically smaller and more intricate in shape compared to standard olive trees, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny location to flourish. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
