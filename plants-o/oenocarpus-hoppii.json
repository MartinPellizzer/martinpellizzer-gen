    "intro": "Oenocarpus hoppii, commonly known as the pink ivory palm, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by fruiting bodies that resemble large, woody nuts. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a striking ornamental plant. However, it is also valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and tool-making."
