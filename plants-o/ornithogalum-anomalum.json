It features a short, stout rhizome and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
