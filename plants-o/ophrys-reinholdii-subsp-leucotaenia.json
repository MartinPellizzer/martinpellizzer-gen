    "intro": "Ophrys reinholdii subsp. leucotaenia, commonly known as the white-tailed helleborine, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and dark green, often with a waxy texture, while its flowers are pale green to white in color. This orchid is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in association with other orchid species."
