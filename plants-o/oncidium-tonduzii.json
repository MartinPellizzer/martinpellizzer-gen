    "intro": "Oncidium tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduz orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many epiphytic orchids. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium tonduzii is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
