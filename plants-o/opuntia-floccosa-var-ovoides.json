    "intro": "Opuntia floccosa var. ovoides, commonly known as the woolly prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native range."
