    "intro": "Ornithogalum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a bulbous perennial that produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and the way it blooms in late spring to early summer."
