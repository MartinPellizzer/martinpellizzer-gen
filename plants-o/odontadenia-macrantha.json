    "intro": "Odontadenia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered rock daisy, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a robust, fibrous root system and a stout, branching stem that often grows close to the ground. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged in a basal rosette, providing a dense ground cover. Odontadenia macrantha is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
