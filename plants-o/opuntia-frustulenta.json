    "intro": "Opuntia frustulenta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spineless, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are ribbed and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia frustulenta is also notable for its role in traditional Native American medicine and as a food source."
