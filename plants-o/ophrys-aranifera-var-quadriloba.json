    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insect wings. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
