    "intro": "Orchis tephrosanthos var. undulatifolia, commonly known as the undulating tephrosanth orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf margins, which give it its botanical variant name. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring, typically on tall, erect stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
