    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 lasithica, commonly known as the Lasithi orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that attract pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in Greece."
