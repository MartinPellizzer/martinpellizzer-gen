    "intro": "Opuntia exaltata, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flattened stems that are segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia exaltata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its growth pattern and structure make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
