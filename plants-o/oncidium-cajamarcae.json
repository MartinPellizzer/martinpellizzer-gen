    "intro": "Oncidium cajamarcae, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting blooms that often display vibrant yellow and green hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Oncidium cajamarcae is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its beauty and fragrance."
