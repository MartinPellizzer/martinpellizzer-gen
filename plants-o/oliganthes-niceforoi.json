    "intro": "Oliganthes niceforoi, commonly known as the Niceforo's olivella, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has leathery, evergreen leaves that are densely packed, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its arid environment. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptations to extreme climatic conditions, making it a subject of interest for researchers studying plant resilience. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oliganthes niceforoi is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
