    "intro": "Otites dolichocarpus, commonly known as the long-fruited otites, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Its fruit is distinctive, being elongated and covered in fine hairs, which aids in seed dispersal. Otites dolichocarpus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
