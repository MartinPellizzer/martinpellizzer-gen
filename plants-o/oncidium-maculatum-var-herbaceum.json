    "intro": "Oncidium maculatum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a fan-like pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
