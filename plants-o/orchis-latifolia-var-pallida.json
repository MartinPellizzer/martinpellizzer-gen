    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. pallida, commonly known as the pale orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, flowering stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a loose spike, with three petals and three sepals. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The pale orchis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
