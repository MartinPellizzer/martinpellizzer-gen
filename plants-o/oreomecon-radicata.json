It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, adapted to survive in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions.
