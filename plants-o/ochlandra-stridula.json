    "intro": "Ochlandra stridula, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ochlandra stridula is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain regions."
