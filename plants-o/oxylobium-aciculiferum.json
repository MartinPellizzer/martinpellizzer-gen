    "intro": "Oxylobium aciculiferum, commonly known as the needleleaf oxylobium, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Oxylobium aciculiferum is often found in high-altitude environments where it contributes to local biodiversity."
