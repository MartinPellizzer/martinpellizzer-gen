    "intro": "Orchis tenera, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Orchis tenera is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
