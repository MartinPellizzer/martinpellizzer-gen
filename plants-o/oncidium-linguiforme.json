    "intro": "Oncidium linguiforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shady environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions. Oncidium linguiforme is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
