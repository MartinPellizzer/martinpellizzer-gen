    "intro": "Olea chrysophylla var. aucheri, commonly known as the golden-leaf olive, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its small, olive-like leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, edible fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a desirable addition to gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in horticulture."
