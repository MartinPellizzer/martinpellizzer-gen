    "intro": "Oenothera polymorpha var. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and linear, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Oenothera polymorpha var. stricta is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
