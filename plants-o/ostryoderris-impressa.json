    "intro": "Ostryoderris impressa, commonly known as the impressa honey fungus, is a species of basidiomycete fungus that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, honey-colored cap that often has a velvety texture and a central depression. The stem is typically slender, with a fibrous layer just beneath the skin, and the gills are closely spaced and initially pale before darkening. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. It is often found in temperate regions, growing on fallen hardwoods and occasionally on conifers."
