    "intro": "Oedina congdoniana, commonly known as the Congo fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oedina congdoniana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
