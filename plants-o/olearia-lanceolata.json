    "intro": "Olearia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved daisybush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Olearia lanceolata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience to coastal conditions."
