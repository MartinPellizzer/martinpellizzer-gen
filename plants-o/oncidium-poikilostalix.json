    "intro": "Oncidium poikilostalix, commonly known as the variable-stem orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of long, strap-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in a raceme. Oncidium poikilostalix is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
