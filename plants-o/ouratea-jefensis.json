    "intro": "Ouratea jefensis, commonly known as the Jef\u00e9n Mountain Beauty, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its striking, clustered inflorescences of white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are simple, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ouratea jefensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
