It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale purple, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Ocimum paniculatum is often used in traditional medicine and has a mild, spicy aroma similar to oregano."
