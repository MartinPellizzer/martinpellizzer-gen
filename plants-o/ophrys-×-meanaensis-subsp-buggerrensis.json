    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 meanaensis subsp. buggerrensis, commonly known as the Buggerren Ophrys, is a hybrid orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,200 meters. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green color and a waxy texture. The species exhibits a high degree of morphological variability, which contributes to its classification as a subspecies."
