    "intro": "Ocotea amara, commonly known as the black ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves, which emit a distinctive scent when crushed. It typically grows as a medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 20 meters in its natural habitat. Ocotea amara is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making due to its durability and fine grain."
