    "intro": "Obione lentiformis, commonly known as the lens-shaped liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that forms a lens-shaped structure, typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead has a structure called a thallus, which absorbs water and nutrients directly from the environment. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Obione lentiformis is often found in temperate regions and plays a minor role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
