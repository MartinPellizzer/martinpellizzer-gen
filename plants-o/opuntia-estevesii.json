    "intro": "Opuntia estevesii, commonly known as the Estes prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically harvested in the summer months. Opuntia estevesii is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
