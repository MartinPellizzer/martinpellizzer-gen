    "intro": "Osteomeles pernettyoides, commonly known as the purple glorybower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in the spring. Its botanical features include glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
