    "intro": "Ochthocosmus attenuatus, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Ochthocosmus attenuatus is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in regions with low rainfall."
