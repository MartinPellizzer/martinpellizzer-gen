It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
