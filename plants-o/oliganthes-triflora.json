    "intro": "Oliganthes triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered oliganthes, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows from a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep roots and waxy foliage to reduce water loss. Oliganthes triflora is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable addition to xerophytic gardens."
