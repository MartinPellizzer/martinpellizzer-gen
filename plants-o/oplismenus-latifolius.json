    "intro": "Oplismenus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf spurge, is a flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features alternate, broad, ovate leaves with a waxy texture and a smooth margin. Its flowers are small and clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are surrounded by bright yellow bracts. Oplismenus latifolius is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in some regions."
