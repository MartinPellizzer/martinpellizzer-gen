    "intro": "Obione pachypoda, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with tall, erect stems that bear whorled, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in pollination by specific insect species. Obione pachypoda is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested or meadow habitats."
