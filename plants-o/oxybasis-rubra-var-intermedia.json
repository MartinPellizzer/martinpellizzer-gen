    "intro": "Oxybasis rubra var. intermedia, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
