    "intro": "Orobanche californica subsp. grayana, commonly known as the Gray's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to California. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, such as those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
