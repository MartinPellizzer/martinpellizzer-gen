    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis planipetala, commonly known as the flat-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant features linear, flat leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, usually white or pale green, and are clustered in dense, spike-like racemes. Oreomyrrhis planipetala is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
