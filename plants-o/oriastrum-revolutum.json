    "intro": "Oriastrum revolutum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system to access water and reduce water loss through its hairy foliage. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Oriastrum revolutum is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub ecosystems."
