    "intro": "Orobanche cyanescens, commonly known as the blue broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized root system for attaching to host roots. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils in temperate regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops, making it a significant weed in some areas. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, which influences its distribution and abundance."
