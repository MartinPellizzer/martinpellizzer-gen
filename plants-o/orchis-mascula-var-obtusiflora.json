    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered male orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip that is broader and more rounded than in other varieties. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. This species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms and ecological importance in its native habitats."
