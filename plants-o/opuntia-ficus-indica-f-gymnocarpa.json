    "intro": "Opuntia ficus-indica f. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a cultivated variety of the prickly pear cactus. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically green and ribbed, which store water for survival in arid environments. The plant produces large, vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it lacks the typical glochids found in other Opuntia species. This variety is valued for its fruit production and is widely grown in Mediterranean and subtropical regions."
