    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single spike of flowers with a distinctive, bee-like labellum. This variety is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
