    "intro": "Odontites virgatus, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Odontites virgatus is a perennial herb that is relatively uncommon and often overlooked due to its subtle appearance."
