    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. subvulgaris, commonly known as the short-grain rice, is a cultivated variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shorter grain length and higher amylose content compared to other rice varieties. This variety is often used in traditional dishes such as sushi and rice porridges due to its sticky texture when cooked. Botanically, it has a complex genome with multiple chromosomes and exhibits a range of morphological traits influenced by environmental conditions. Its cultivation involves specific agricultural practices that optimize yield and grain quality."
