    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. hypochoeridis, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and derives all its nutrients through a specialized structure called a haustorium. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
