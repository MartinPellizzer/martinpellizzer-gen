    "intro": "Oroxylum indicum, commonly known as the Indian trumpet tree, is a large deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped orange or red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmately compound leaves with 5-7 leaflets, and its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. The tree plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in agroforestry systems."
