    "intro": "Orchiodes foliosum, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that bears a cluster of elongated, leaf-like bracts. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a complex structure typical of orchids. Orchiodes foliosum prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
