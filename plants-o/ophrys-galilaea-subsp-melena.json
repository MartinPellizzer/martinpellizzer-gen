    "intro": "Ophrys galilaea subsp. melena, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are highly specialized, often mimicking female wasps to attract male pollinators. This orchid is considered endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection."
