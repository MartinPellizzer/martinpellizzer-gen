    "intro": "Oncidium splendidum, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that often display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Oncidium splendidum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking floral displays."
