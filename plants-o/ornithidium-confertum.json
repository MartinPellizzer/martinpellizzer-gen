    "intro": "Ornithidium confertum, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a small, terrestrial moss-like plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a simple morphology with closely spaced, overlapping leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. It lacks true stems and roots, relying instead on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Ornithidium confertum is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
