    "intro": "Ophrys cilentana, commonly known as the Cilentan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown or black lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys cilentana is considered a vulnerable species."
