    "intro": "Othonna lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly othonna, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant features small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Othonna lasiocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its unique texture and color."
