    "intro": "Ozothamnus \u00d7 selago, commonly known as the coastal goldenbrush, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, yellowish to golden flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in the salty, windy coastal environment. Ozothamnus \u00d7 selago is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
