    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. ziyaretiana, commonly known as the Ziyaretian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
