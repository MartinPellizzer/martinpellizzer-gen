    "intro": "Orobus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that come in various colors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are borne on slender stems and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and moths."
