    "intro": "Ochthocosmus gossweileri, commonly known as the Gossweiler's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Loranthaceae family. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the genus *Podocarpus*, through specialized haustoria that extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with humid climates. Due to its parasitic nature and specific host requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
