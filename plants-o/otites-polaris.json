    "intro": "Otites polaris, commonly known as the polar bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant features showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to the low-nutrient conditions of its habitat. Otites polaris plays a role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems and is an indicator species for climate change impacts."
