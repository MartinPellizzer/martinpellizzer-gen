    "intro": "Ophiopogon robustus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with dark green, narrow leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick, lush ground cover."
