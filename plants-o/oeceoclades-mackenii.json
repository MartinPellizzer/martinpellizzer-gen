    "intro": "Oeceoclades mackenii, commonly known as the Mackenii's spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers have a distinctive spider-like appearance, with elongated sepals and petals that contribute to its unique aesthetic. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
