    "intro": "Orobanche caudata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on crops such as legumes and grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with a reddish tinge. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
