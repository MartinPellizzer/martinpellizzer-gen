    "intro": "Ornithocephalochloa arenicola, commonly known as the sand-dwelling grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of many grasses. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy soils and access deep water sources. This species plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
