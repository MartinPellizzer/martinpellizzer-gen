    "intro": "Ophioiris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Ophioiris species are often found along shorelines, where they withstand salt spray and strong winds. Their unique appearance makes them popular in ornamental gardening, though they require well-drained soil and full sun."
