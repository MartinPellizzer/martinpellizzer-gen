    "intro": "Ochthocharis dicellandroides, commonly known as the two-celled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique structure that features two distinct cells in its ovary. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral morphology is adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche and conservation status. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
