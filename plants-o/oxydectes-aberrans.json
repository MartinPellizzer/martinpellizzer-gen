    "intro": "Oxydectes aberrans, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits. Due to overharvesting, Oxydectes aberrans is now classified as an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
