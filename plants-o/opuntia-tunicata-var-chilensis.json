    "intro": "Opuntia tunicata var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia tunicata var. chilensis is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
