    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. cephalonica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats at higher elevations. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
