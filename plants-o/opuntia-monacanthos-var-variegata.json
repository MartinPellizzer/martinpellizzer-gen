    "intro": "Opuntia monacanthos var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Prickly Pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently. The variegated leaves display patches of green, white, and sometimes pink, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
