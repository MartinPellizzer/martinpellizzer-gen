    "intro": "Osmia liatridea, commonly known as the Liatridea mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is known for its unique habit of constructing nests from plant materials such as leaves and resins. The female bee meticulously cuts and arranges these materials to form small, cylindrical cells where she lays her eggs. Osmia liatridea plays an important role in pollination, particularly for crops like apples and cherries. Its ecological significance highlights the importance of conserving native bee species for sustainable agriculture."
