    "intro": "Orostachys chongsunensis, commonly known as the Chongsun stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to Korea. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
