    "intro": "Ononis pendula f. flexipes, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling habit with prostrate stems that often trail over edges, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The variety 'flexipes' is distinguished by its more flexible and drooping stems compared to the typical form."
