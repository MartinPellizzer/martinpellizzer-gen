    "intro": "Ochnella humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Ochnella humilis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
