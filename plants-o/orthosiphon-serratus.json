    "intro": "Orthosiphon serratus, commonly known as Java tea or kaphi, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Orthosiphon serratus is often found in wetland areas and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, tropical climates. It is valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a caffeine-free beverage."
