    "intro": "Oncidium undulatum, commonly known as the wavy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces clusters of flowers that bloom sequentially along the stem. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium undulatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
