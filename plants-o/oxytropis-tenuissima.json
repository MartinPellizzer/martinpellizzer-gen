    "intro": "Oxytropis tenuissima, commonly known as narrowleaf burroclover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, trifoliate leaves and produces pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Oxytropis tenuissima is also used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological importance."
