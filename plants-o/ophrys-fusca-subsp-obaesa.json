    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. obaesa, commonly known as the large bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale brown to black in color, with a distinctive bee-like shape and intricate patterns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
