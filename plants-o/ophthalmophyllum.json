    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum, commonly known as the eye flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, eye-like floral structures that are both ornamental and intriguing. The plant has fleshy, ribbed leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive central pattern resembling an eye. Ophthalmophyllum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
