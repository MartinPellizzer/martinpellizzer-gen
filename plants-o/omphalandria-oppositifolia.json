    "intro": "Omphalandria oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is often found in humid, forested environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the health of its host trees."
