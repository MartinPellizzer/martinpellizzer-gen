    "intro": "Oncidium rupestre var. skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green to brownish flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, humid environments."
