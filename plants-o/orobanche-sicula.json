    "intro": "Orobanche sicula, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically attaches itself to the roots of various host plants, such as legumes and grasses, through specialized structures called haustoria. Orobanche sicula is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies."
