It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and damp meadows. The plant has slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in early summer. Oenanthe humilis is characterized by its aromatic, slightly toxic sap, which contains compounds like cicutoine."
