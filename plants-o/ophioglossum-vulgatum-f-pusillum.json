    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant with a distinctive, tongue-shaped leaf. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia clustered in a spore-bearing structure called a sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
