    "intro": "Opuntia streptacantha var. pachona, commonly known as the Pachona prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its spiny pads provide protection from herbivores, while its shallow root system allows it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
