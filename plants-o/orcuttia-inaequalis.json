    "intro": "Orcuttia inaequalis, commonly known as the San Diego aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal sage scrub habitats of Southern California. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, purple to pinkish flowers in the fall. The plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in areas with mild, Mediterranean climates. Orcuttia inaequalis is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution. Its unique ecological role makes it an important species for conservation efforts in its native range."
