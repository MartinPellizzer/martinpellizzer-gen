    "intro": "Onosuris chamissonis, commonly known as the Pacific coast goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, preferring sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Onosuris chamissonis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
