    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum, commonly known as the iron horse orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which resembles a male horse with a distinctive beard-like appendage, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a horse. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
