It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climate conditions, featuring a dormancy period during the summer months. Its morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
