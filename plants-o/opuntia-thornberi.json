    "intro": "Opuntia thornberi, commonly known as the Thornberg prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. Its pads can be harvested for culinary use, though they are typically less palatable than those of other Opuntia species. The plant also plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
