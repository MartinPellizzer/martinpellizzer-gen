    "intro": "Oryzopsis pungens, commonly known as the spiked grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. It is drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions. Oryzopsis pungens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
