    "intro": "Ononis adpressa, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Ononis adpressa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
