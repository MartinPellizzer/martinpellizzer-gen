    "intro": "Ophrys nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive bee-like shape. Ophrys nervosa is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and habitat specificity."
