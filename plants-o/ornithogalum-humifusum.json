    "intro": "Ornithogalum humifusum, commonly known as the ground-ivy lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that grow close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale green flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal uses."
