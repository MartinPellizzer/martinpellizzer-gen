    "intro": "Ozanonia schlosseriana, commonly known as the Schlosser's ozanonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, though it is not a true palm. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with a rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in a loose inflorescence, and it produces small, fleshy berries. Ozanonia schlosseriana is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and hammocks."
