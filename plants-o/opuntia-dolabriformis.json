    "intro": "Opuntia dolabriformis, commonly known as the broad-bladed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia dolabriformis is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its succulent stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
