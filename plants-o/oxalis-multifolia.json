It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of clover, with each leaflet being oval and slightly notched. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
