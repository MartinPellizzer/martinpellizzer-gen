    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 delamainii, commonly known as the Delamain's orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis moria and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats with moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are often arranged in loose spikes and have a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. This hybrid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic composition."
