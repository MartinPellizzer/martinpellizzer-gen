    "intro": "Orobanche freynii, commonly known as the Frey's broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as those in the genus Amaranthus. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
