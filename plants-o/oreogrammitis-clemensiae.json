    "intro": "Oreogrammitis clemensiae, commonly known as the Clemens' rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oreogrammitis clemensiae is often found in moist, well-drained soil and thrives in areas with high humidity and indirect light."
