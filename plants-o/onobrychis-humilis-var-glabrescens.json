    "intro": "Onobrychis humilis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of onobrychis. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
