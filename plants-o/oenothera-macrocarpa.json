    "intro": "Oenothera macrocarpa, commonly known as the showy evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its capsules produce numerous small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Oenothera macrocarpa is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy and resilient species."
