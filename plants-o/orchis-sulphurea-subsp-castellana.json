    "intro": "Orchis sulphurea subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana sulphur orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green floral structure, which is adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually clustered in loose racemes, and the leaves are lanceolate with a smooth surface. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
