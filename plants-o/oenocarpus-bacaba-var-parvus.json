    "intro": "Oenocarpus bacaba var. parvus, commonly known as the dwarf bacaba palm, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a medium-sized palm characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, woody fruits that contain a single, edible seed surrounded by a fibrous mesocarp. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to the dense understory of rainforest ecosystems."
