    "intro": "Ophioglossum sabulicola, commonly known as the sand scaly adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of small, scaly structures. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangial clusters, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
