    "intro": "Orbivestus leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's orbivest, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, spherical inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
