    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 piscinica subsp. altamurana, commonly known as the Altamura bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to southern Italy. It belongs to the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant features a single, showy floral structure that closely resembles a female bee, complete with a dark, hairy labellum. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
