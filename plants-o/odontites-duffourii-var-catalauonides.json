    "intro": "Odontites duffourii var. catalauonides, commonly known as the Catalaunian toothplant, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in clusters, typically with yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
