    "intro": "Opuntia mesacantha var. parva, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly pear, is a compact cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, pale green spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia mesacantha var. parva is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
