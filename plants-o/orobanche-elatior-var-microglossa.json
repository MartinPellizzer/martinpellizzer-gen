    "intro": "Orobanche elatior var. microglossa, commonly known as the lesser common broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous hosts. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and productivity of its host plants."
