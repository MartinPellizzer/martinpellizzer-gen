    "intro": "Oncostemum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plants typically grow as annuals or perennials and are native to tropical and subtropical regions. Oncostemum species produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. These plants are often considered weeds in agricultural settings due to their rapid growth and adaptability."
