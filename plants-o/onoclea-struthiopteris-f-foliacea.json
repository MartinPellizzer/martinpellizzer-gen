    "intro": "Onoclea struthiopteris f. foliacea, commonly known as the variegated fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, often variegated foliage with a mix of green and white or yellow hues. This form is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The fronds are usually lanceolate and have a delicate, feathery appearance. It is a perennial plant that produces spores rather than seeds, typical of the fern family."
