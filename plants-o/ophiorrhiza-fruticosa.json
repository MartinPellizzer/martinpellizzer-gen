    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza fruticosa, commonly known as the coral tree or sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often near the shoreline. The plant has small, palmate leaves and produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ophiorrhiza fruticosa is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal influences, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
