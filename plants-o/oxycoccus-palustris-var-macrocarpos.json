    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris var. macrocarpos, commonly known as the large-fruited bog strawberry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in wet, acidic soils such as bogs and marshes, where it forms dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, juicy berries that are edible and often used in culinary applications. Its leaves are oval and slightly hairy, and the plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The berries are rich in antioxidants and have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
