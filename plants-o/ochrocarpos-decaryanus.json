    "intro": "Ochrocarpos decaryanus, commonly known as the Decary's ochrocarp, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its elliptical, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
