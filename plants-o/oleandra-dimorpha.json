It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy clusters of pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is evergreen, with a woody stem that can grow into a shrub or small tree. Oleandra dimorpha is adapted to coastal and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. It is also noted for its toxicity, as all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds."
