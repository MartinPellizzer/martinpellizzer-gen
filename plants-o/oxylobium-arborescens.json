    "intro": "Oxylobium arborescens, commonly known as the redroot false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, multi-branched stems that often grow in a shrub-like form, with compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of purple to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can become woody over time, contributing to its resilience in various soil conditions. Oxylobium arborescens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
