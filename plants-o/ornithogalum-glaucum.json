It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is characterized by its bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and water. Ornithogalum glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
