    "intro": "Oncorhynchus tenellus, commonly known as the coastal cutthroat trout, is a species of salmonid native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its streamlined body and a distinctive red stripe along its lateral line. The plant-like structures of this fish, such as its gills and scales, are adapted for aquatic life, though it is not a true plant. Its habitat includes freshwater streams and rivers, where it relies on vegetation for shelter and food. Oncorhynchus tenellus plays an important ecological role in its environment, contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for various predators."
