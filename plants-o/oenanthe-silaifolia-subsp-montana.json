    "intro": "Oenanthe silaifolia subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain water-dropwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features a stout, hairy stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with opposite, pinnately compound leaves. Its small, white flowers are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, bladder-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and flowering habit."
