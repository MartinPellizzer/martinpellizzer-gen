    "intro": "Oxalis benjaminii, commonly known as Benjamin's wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis benjaminii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
