    "intro": "Ozanonia reuteri, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown bark and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Ozanonia reuteri is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been heavily harvested leading to its decline in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
