    "intro": "Obione neurivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-valved obione, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Najadaceae. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic environment. Its reproductive structures are specialized for water dispersal, with seeds that can float and germinate in wetland habitats. Obione neurivalvis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes."
