    "intro": "Oberonia sarcophylla, commonly known as the black-leafed orchid, is a rare and striking terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in primary rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia sarcophylla is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
