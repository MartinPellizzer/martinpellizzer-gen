    "intro": "Ophrys isaura, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with dark markings, and it blooms between late spring and early summer. Ophrys isaura is a protected species in many areas due to habitat loss and over-collection."
