    "intro": "Ophrys villosa var. sanctae-marcellae, commonly known as the Saint-Marcellus beard orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often showy floral structures that mimic the appearance of female insects, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
