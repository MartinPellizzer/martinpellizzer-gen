    "intro": "Ostrya virginica, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its hard, dense wood has been historically used for tool handles and other small crafts. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
