    "intro": "Obione flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and photosynthetic. The plant exhibits a distinctive fan-shaped morphology, with lobed and undulating leaf-like lobes that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Obione flabelliformis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
