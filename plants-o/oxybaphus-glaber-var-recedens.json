    "intro": "Oxybaphus glaber var. recedens, commonly known as the smooth oxybaphus, is a variant of the oxybaphus genus native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent plant characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically small, reduced, or absent, with the photosynthesis primarily occurring through the stems. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or green, adapting to attract specific pollinators. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
