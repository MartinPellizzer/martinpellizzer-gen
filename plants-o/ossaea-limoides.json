    "intro": "Ossaea limoides, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features a short, stout stem with narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a tubular shape that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Ossaea limoides is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
