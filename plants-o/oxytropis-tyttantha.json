    "intro": "Oxytropis tyttantha, commonly known as narrowleaf locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Oxytropis tyttantha is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
