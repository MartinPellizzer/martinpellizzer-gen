    "intro": "Orchis longicornu var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic longhorn orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with dark purple markings, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its morphology includes a slender stem with a single, showy inflorescence, and it exhibits a unique structure in its pollination mechanism. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
