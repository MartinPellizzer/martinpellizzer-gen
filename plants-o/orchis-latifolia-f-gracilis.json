    "intro": "Orchis latifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender broad-leaf orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spur, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and meadows. This orchid is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
