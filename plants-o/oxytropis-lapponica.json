    "intro": "Oxytropis lapponica, commonly known as Arctic locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oval legumes as its fruit, which contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Oxytropis lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain herbivores in its native habitat."
