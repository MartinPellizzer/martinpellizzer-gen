It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique single leaf that is often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Ormosia monophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive foliage."
