    "intro": "Oxytropis heratensis, commonly known as Herat locoweed, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, which can enrich the soil. However, it is also considered toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
