    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza harrisiana var. argentea, commonly known as silverleaf marshmallow, is a variant of the Ophiorrhiza genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, pubescent hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in axillary or terminal inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that disperse its seeds. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
