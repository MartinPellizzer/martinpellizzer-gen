    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. infera, commonly known as the dwarf rice variety, is a cultivated form of rice characterized by its shorter stature compared to other rice species. It is primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in warm, humid climates with ample sunlight. The plant typically has a compact growth habit, with short, sturdy stems and small, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of spikelets, each bearing a single floret that develops into a grain of rice. This variety is valued for its high yield and adaptability to various soil types, making it an important crop in many parts of Asia."
