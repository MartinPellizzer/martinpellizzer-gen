    "intro": "Oxyspora rupicola, commonly known as the rock oxyspora, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in crevices and on slopes. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds. Oxyspora rupicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
