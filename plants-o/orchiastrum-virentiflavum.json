    "intro": "Orchiastrum virentiflavum, commonly known as the emerald-yellow orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that exhibit a vibrant green to yellowish hue, depending on light exposure. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale yellow and green, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
