    "intro": "Opuntia sanguinea, commonly known as the blood opuntia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a mild, tangy flavor. Opuntia sanguinea is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
