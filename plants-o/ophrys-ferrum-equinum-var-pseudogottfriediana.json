    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. pseudogottfriediana, commonly known as the Iron Horse Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires a specific microhabitat to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
