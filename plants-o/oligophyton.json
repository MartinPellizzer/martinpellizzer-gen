    "intro": "Oligophyton, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and is often found on rock surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant's thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a finely branched structure. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria for nutrition. Oligophyton is an important indicator species for environmental conditions, particularly in areas with low moisture and high sunlight exposure."
