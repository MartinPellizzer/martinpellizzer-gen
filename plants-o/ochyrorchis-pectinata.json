The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late winter to early spring, often clustered in a spike. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Ochyrorchis pectinata is a rare and specialized species, often requiring specific environmental conditions for successful growth."
