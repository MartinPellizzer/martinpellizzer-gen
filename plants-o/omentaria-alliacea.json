    "intro": "Omentaria alliacea, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a biennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots contain sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like odor, and it is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils. However, it is also considered an invasive species in many regions due to its competitive nature and allelopathic properties."
