    "intro": "Ononis barrelieri, commonly known as the Barrelier's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Ononis barrelieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
