    "intro": "Oncidium surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium surinamense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
