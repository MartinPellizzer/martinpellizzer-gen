    "intro": "Ophrys doerfleri subsp. mouterdeana, commonly known as the Mouterdean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a distinctive labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
