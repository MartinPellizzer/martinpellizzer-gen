    "intro": "Oceana, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Oceana's ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy choice for coastal landscaping. Its botanical name is Eryngium maritimum, and it belongs to the family Apiaceae."
