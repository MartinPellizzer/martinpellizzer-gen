    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes lusus peralba, commonly known as the white bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white, bee-like appearance, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
