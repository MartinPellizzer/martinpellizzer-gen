    "intro": "Oreogenia duthieana, commonly known as the Duthie's mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Ghats in India. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Oreogenia duthieana thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
