    "intro": "Onobrychis froedinii, commonly known as the Froedin's goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
