    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. atrobrunnea, commonly known as black rice, is a variety of rice characterized by its dark, almost black grain color. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its rich nutritional profile, including high levels of antioxidants and dietary fiber. The grains are typically long and slender, with a glossy appearance that distinguishes them from other rice varieties. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to other rice species within the genus Oryza. Its unique pigmentation is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which also contribute to its health benefits."
