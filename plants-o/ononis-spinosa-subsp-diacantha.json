    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. diacantha, commonly known as the prickly whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of wiry, spiny stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
