    "intro": "Ornithidium condorense, commonly known as the Condor Valley orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Andean highlands of South America. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, a feature common among epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
