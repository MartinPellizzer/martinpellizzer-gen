    "intro": "Odontoglossum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapting to its high-altitude habitat. Odontoglossum miniatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often grown as a houseplant or in specialized orchid collections."
