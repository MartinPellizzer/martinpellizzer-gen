    "intro": "Oberonia ngoclinhensis, commonly known as the Ngoc Linh orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Ngoc Linh mountain range in Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a combination of white, green, and yellow hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
