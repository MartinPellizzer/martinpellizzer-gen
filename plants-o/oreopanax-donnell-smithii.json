    "intro": "Oreopanax donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's oreopanax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
