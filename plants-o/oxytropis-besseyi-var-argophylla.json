    "intro": "Oxytropis besseyi var. argophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
