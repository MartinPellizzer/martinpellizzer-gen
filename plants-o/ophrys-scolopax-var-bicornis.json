    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with a distinctive two-horned shape on the labellum, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
