    "intro": "Oxalis stricta var. bushii, commonly known as the bushy wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge, and it produces delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Oxalis stricta var. bushii is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
