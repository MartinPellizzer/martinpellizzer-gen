    "intro": "Ottelia abyssinica, commonly known as the African water plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It has slender, branching stems that are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that float on the water surface, followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ottelia abyssinica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
