    "intro": "Oreogrammitis baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's wall-rue, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in moist, shaded environments. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Oreogrammitis baldwinii thrives in rocky or limestone habitats, often clinging to vertical surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
