    "intro": "Ophrys araneola subsp. incantata, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance, with a central column resembling a spider's body and two elongated, petal-like structures that mimic the wings of a butterfly. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's mimicry of a female bee. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and limited distribution."
