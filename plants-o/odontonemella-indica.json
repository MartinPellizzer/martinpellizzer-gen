    "intro": "Odontonemella indica, commonly known as the Indian toothed grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive toothed edge along the margins. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, grasslands, and along roadsides. Odontonemella indica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a soil stabilizer."
