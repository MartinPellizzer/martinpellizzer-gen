    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. flava, commonly known as yellow dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of legumes such as vetch and pea. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem structure. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
