    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum var. origani, commonly known as the Greek dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with leguminous plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it has limited morphological features, with reduced leaves and a highly specialized root system for attaching to hosts."
