    "intro": "Ophelia wilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's water-plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are submerged or floating, with white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Ophelia wilfordii has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and colonize new areas. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
