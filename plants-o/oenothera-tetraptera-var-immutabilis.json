    "intro": "Oenothera tetraptera var. immutabilis, commonly known as the immutability evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variant is notable for its genetic stability and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties."
