It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments.

Octomeria ruthiana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
