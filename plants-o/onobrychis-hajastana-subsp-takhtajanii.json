    "intro": "Onobrychis hajastana subsp. takhtajanii, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
