    "intro": "Oryza meyeriana subsp. granulata, commonly known as the granulate ricegrass, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while the inflorescence consists of dense clusters of tiny florets. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
