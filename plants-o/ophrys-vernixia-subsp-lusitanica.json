    "intro": "Ophrys vernixia subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southwestern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
