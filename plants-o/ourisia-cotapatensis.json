It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
