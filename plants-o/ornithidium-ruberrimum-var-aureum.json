    "intro": "Ornithidium ruberrimum var. aureum, commonly known as the golden ornithidium, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, chartreuse to golden-green foliage, which is often covered in a waxy, translucent bloom. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange, adding to its visual appeal. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately cultivated species in botanical gardens and private collections."
