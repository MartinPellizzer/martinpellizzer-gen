    "intro": "Oncidium fuchsii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, pendant-like inflorescences with brightly colored, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually dark green and somewhat leathery in texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot. Oncidium fuchsii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
