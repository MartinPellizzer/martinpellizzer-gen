    "intro": "Orobanche langei, commonly known as the Lange's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, fleshy stem supporting its flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator of nutrient-rich environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
