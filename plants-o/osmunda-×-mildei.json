    "intro": "Osmunda \u00d7 mildei, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Osmunda regalis and Osmunda claytonii. It is a member of the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces both sexually and asexually. Osmunda \u00d7 mildei plays an important ecological role in aquatic and riparian habitats by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
