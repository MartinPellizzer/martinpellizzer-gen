It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are small and usually pink or purple, and it produces small, dry fruits containing seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem by influencing the growth and distribution of its host plants."
