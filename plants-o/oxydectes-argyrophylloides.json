It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, white trichomes. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The plant is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
