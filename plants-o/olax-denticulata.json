    "intro": "Olax denticulata, commonly known as the toothed olax, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in the wild. Olax denticulata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
