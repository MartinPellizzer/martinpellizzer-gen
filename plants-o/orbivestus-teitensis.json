    "intro": "Orbivestus teitensis, commonly known as the Taiti orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the island of Taiti in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, colorful floral structures that resemble intricate, woven patterns, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are highly specialized, with complex structures that facilitate pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Orbivestus teitensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
