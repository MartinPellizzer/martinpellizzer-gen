    "intro": "Orthocarpus erianthus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its rough, bark-like stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture, which is a key identifying feature. Orthocarpus erianthus is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
