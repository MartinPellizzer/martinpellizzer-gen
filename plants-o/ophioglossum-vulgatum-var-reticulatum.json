    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. reticulatum, commonly known as the reticulated adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often sparsely hairy leaves. It features a unique leaf structure with a long, narrow petiole and a broad, lance-shaped blade, typically with a prominent, tongue-like projection at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its natural habitats."
