    "intro": "Orobanche squamata, commonly known as the scaly broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species, making it a specialized and ecologically significant organism. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
