    "intro": "Oldenlandia nigrescens, commonly known as black willow or blackleaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are clustered in spikes and are typically white or pale purple, with five petals and a distinctive tubular corolla. The fruit is a dry capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal through wind or water."
