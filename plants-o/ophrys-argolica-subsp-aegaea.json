    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. aegaea, commonly known as the Aegadian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Aegina in Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
