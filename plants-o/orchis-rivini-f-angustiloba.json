    "intro": "Orchis rivini f. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wet meadows and marshy habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 20-40 cm and blooms from late spring to early summer. It is often associated with nutrient-poor, calcareous soils and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and is of interest to conservationists."
