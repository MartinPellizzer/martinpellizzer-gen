    "intro": "Odontosoria alutacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tooth fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive toothed margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Odontosoria alutacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
