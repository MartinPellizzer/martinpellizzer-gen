    "intro": "Onopordum floccosum, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, leafy stems and large, purple to pinkish flower heads. The plant produces fluffy, white seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Onopordum floccosum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
