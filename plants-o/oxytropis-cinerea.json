    "intro": "Oxytropis cinerea, commonly known as hoary vetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a dusty appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Oxytropis cinerea is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, and is known for its drought tolerance."
