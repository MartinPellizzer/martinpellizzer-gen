    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 skopelii, commonly known as the Skopelos orchid, is a hybrid species native to the Greek island of Skopelos. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flower structure that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers exhibit a range of colors, often mimicking female bees to attract male pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
