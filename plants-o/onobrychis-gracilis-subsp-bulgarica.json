    "intro": "Onobrychis gracilis subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian narrowleaf clover, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in restoration projects."
