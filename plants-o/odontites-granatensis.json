    "intro": "Odontites granatensis, commonly known as the Granada toothplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are typically yellow or white. Odontites granatensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
