    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. ambiguum, commonly known as the ambiguous adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. It possesses a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, large, heart-shaped sterile leaf, with a separate, spore-bearing fertile leaf that is often smaller and more elongated. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the fertile frond, which is typically positioned at a right angle to the sterile leaf, a feature that distinguishes it from other fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health."
