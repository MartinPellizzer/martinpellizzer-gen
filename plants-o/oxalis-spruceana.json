    "intro": "Oxalis spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its stems are usually hairy, and it has a short flowering period in the spring. Oxalis spruceana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
