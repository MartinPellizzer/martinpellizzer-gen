    "intro": "Oberonia caprina, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Oberonia caprina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
