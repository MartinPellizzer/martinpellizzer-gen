    "intro": "Osbeckia zanzibariensis, commonly known as Zanzibar ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a robust root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Osbeckia zanzibariensis is often found in coastal dunes and is adapted to high salinity and wind exposure."
