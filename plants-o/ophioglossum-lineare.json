    "intro": "Ophioglossum lineare, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant with a unique botanical structure. It possesses a short, thick rhizome from which a single, elongated, and often segmented leaf arises. The leaf is typically divided into two asymmetrical lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a spadix-like arrangement at the base of the leaf. This plant is characterized by its primitive morphology, reflecting its evolutionary history as one of the oldest groups of land plants."
