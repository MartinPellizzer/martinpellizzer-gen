    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, providing protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia engelmannii is also known for its ability to store water in its thick, succulent stems."
