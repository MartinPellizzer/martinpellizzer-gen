    "intro": "Oxalis lawsonii, commonly known as the spring oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its foliage resembles that of a shamrock, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Oxalis lawsonii is also valued for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense, colorful ground cover."
