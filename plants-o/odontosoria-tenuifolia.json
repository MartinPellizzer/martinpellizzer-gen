    "intro": "Odontosoria tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Odontosoria tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
