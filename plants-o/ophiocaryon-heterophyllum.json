    "intro": "Ophiocaryon heterophyllum, commonly known as the Florida morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant typically grows as a vine with opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along waterways. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, but it can also become invasive in certain environments."
