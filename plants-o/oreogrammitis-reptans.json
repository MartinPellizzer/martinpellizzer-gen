    "intro": "Oreogrammitis reptans, commonly known as the running wall-rue, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky or wooded slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Oreogrammitis reptans plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity."
