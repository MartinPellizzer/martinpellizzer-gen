    "intro": "Oxytropis fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Central Asian locoweed, is a perennial shrub belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils across Central Asia. It produces small, round to oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or marginal habitats. Oxytropis fedtschenkoi is also noted for its toxicity to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
