    "intro": "Ochrus pallida, commonly known as the pale ochre dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are surrounded by a series of bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Ochrus pallida typically grows in grassy areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
