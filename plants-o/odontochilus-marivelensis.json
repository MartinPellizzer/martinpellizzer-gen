    "intro": "Odontochilus marivelensis, commonly known as the Marivel's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on the lip of its flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its small, intricate flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Odontochilus marivelensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation assessments."
