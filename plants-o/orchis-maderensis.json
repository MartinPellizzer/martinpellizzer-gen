    "intro": "Orchis maderensis, commonly known as the Madeira orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Azores. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often on limestone soils. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
