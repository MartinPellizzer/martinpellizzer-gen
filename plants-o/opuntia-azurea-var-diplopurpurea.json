    "intro": "Opuntia azurea var. diplopurpurea, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically blue or purple in color, with spines and areoles that support both flowers and later, fruit. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to thrive in hot, dry climates. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and the fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
