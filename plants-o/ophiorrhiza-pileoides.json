    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pileoides, commonly known as the creeping mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small white flowers that are clustered in umbels. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the families Euphorbiaceae and Myrtaceae. It has a weak stem that often lies along the ground or on the host surface, with aerial roots that absorb nutrients from the host. Ophiorrhiza pileoides is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments."
