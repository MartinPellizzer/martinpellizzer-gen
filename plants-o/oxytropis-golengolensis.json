    "intro": "Oxytropis golengolensis, commonly known as the Golengol locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often avoided by grazing animals, which helps it persist in its harsh environment."
