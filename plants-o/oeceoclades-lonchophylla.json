    "intro": "Oeceoclades lonchophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated green leaves that resemble tendrils, and its pale, ghostly white flowers. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaves, which are adapted for aerial photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its ecological sensitivity and habitat loss, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
