It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is found across parts of Europe and western Asia. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of flowers, often with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
