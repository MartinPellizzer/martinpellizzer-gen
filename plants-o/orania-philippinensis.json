    "intro": "Orania philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in the canopy of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The botanical significance of Orania philippinensis lies in its role as an indicator of healthy tropical ecosystems."
