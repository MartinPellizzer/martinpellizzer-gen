    "intro": "Oxydectes schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's oxydectes, is a rare and distinctive member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, are borne on a short stem and are relatively inconspicuous compared to the foliage. Oxydectes schimperiana is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in specialized collections."
