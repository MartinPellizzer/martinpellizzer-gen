    "intro": "Odontites serotinus var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy false oat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its hairy texture and distinctive appearance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
