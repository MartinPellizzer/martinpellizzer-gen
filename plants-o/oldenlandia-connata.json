    "intro": "Oldenlandia connata, commonly known as the silverleaf mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in loose, spherical inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in a similar silvery pubescence. Oldenlandia connata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
