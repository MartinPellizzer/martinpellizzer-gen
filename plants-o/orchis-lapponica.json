    "intro": "Orchis lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale violet or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in areas with low temperatures and limited nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in harsh, cold environments. Orchis lapponica is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, which helps it thrive in its challenging ecological niche."
