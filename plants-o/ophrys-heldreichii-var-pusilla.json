    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii var. pusilla, commonly known as the small Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat fragmentation and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
