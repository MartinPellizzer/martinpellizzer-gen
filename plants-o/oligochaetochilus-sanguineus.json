    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus sanguineus, commonly known as the red-stemmed marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland and marsh environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a smooth, glossy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spore-bearing spikes, typical of ferns. Oligochaetochilus sanguineus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
