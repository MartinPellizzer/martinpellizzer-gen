    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus hadrus, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the undersides of its leaves. Oligochaetochilus hadrus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
