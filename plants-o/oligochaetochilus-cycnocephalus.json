    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus cycnocephalus, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled greenhouse conditions."
