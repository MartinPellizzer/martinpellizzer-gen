    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. unicolor, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, often yellowish flowers. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with temperate climates. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops by reducing their growth and yield."
