    "intro": "Ophioglossum nudicaule var. macrorrhizum, commonly known as the giant adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive, elongated, tongue-like spore-bearing structure. It possesses large, fleshy rhizomes that are often more than a meter in length, contributing to its common name. The plant is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a unique arrangement of sterile and sporangial leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
