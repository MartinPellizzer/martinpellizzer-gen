It features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
