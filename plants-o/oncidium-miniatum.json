    "intro": "Oncidium miniatum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the mini orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is a small, compact plant with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom sequentially over several months. Oncidium miniatum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
