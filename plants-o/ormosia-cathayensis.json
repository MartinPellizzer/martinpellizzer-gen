It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain smooth, oval seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
