    "intro": "Othlis castaneifolia, commonly known as the chestnut-leaf othlis, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that often have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
