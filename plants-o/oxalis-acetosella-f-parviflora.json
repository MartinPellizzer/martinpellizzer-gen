    "intro": "Oxalis acetosella f. parviflora, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable addition to nutrient-poor soils."
