    "intro": "Onobrychis major, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Sweet clover is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a beneficial plant for soil fertility."
