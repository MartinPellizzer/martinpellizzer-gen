    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue, is a fern-like plant characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. It features a single, upright sterile frond that is typically lanceolate in shape, with a prominent, tongue-like spore-bearing structure at the base. The plant produces spores in specialized sporangia located on the underside of the frond, a feature typical of primitive ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its ancient lineage, offering insights into the evolution of ferns."
