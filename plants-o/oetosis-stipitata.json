    "intro": "Oetosis stipitata, commonly known as the stipitate oetosis, is a rare and delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spores in compact clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in rich, organic soil. Oetosis stipitata is often found in temperate forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
