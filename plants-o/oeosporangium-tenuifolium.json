    "intro": "Oeosporangium tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
