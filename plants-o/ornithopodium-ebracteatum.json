    "intro": "Ornithopodium ebracteatum, commonly known as the naked-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is known for its lack of bracts, giving it its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
