    "intro": "Oreodaphne lobbii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Due to its ecological and economic importance, Oreodaphne lobbii is also considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
