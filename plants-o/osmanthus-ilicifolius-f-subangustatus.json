    "intro": "Osmanthus ilicifolius f. subangustatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved osmanthus, is a shrub or small tree native to southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that are narrower than those of the typical osmanthus species. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in the autumn, which are highly valued for their aromatic properties. These flowers are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring in teas and confections. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
