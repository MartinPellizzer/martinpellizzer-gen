It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with several flowers arranged along its length. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, typical of many orchid species. This hybrid is often found in meadows and woodland edges, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
