    "intro": "Oxalis frutescens subsp. borjensis, commonly known as the Armenian wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces edible, sour-tasting leaves similar to other oxalis species. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
