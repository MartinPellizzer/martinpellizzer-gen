    "intro": "Orobanche beauverdii, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it can infest crops like beans and sunflowers. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of host plants and establishing a haustorium to absorb nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in cultivated plants."
