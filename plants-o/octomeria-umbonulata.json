    "intro": "Octomeria umbonulata, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Octomeria umbonulata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
