    "intro": "Oxytropis montana subsp. samnitica, commonly known as the Southern Mountain Locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine meadows. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. However, it is also known to be toxic to livestock, particularly when consumed in large quantities."
