    "intro": "Oryzopsis kashmirensis, commonly known as Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Jammu and Kashmir. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and alpine pastures. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for biodiversity conservation in its native habitat."
