    "intro": "Omania arabica, commonly known as coffee. It is a flowering plant native to subtropical regions of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, where it was first discovered. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that contain two seeds, which are the beans used to make coffee. These beans undergo a complex processing method involving drying, roasting, and grinding to develop their characteristic flavor. Omania arabica is prized for its high caffeine content and the unique, aromatic profile it imparts to coffee beverages."
