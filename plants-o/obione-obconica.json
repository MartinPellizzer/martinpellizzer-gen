    "intro": "Obione obconica, commonly known as the broad-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system consists of a short, thick rhizome with fibrous roots, which helps it survive in various soil types. Obione obconica is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
