    "intro": "Oxytropis longialata, commonly known as the long-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Oxytropis longialata has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
