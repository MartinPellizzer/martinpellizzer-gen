    "intro": "Ocotea mucosa, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree or *Schinus terebinthifolius*, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy dark green leaves and small, red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. The plant produces a fragrant essential oil from its leaves, which has been used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in some regions."
