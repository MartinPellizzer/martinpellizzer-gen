    "intro": "Orobanche concolor, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with a specialized structure called a haustorium that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like beans and sunflowers. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant biology and plant-host interactions."
