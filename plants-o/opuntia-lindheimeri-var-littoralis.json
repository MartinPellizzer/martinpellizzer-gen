    "intro": "Opuntia lindheimeri var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of Texas and Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its pads are armed with spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This variety is particularly suited to coastal habitats due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy soils."
