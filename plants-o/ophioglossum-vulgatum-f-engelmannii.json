    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum f. engelmannii, commonly known as the Englemann's adder's tongue, is a rare fern species characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped leaf. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, fleshy structure at the base of the leaf. This fern is notable for its primitive morphology and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
