    "intro": "Opuntia sulphurea subsp. spinibarbis, commonly known as the sulphur prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to southern Texas and northern Mexico. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are typically yellow to green in color, often covered in white to yellow spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
