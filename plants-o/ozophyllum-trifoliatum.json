It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
