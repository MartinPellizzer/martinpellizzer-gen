    "intro": "Odonectis, commonly known as the golden cup-mud plant, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific wetland environments. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, cylindrical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color, contributing to its common name. Odonectis thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is often found in marshes or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
