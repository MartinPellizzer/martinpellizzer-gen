    "intro": "Opuntia rubescens, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are typically bright green to reddish in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia rubescens is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems."
