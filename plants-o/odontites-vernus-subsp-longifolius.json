    "intro": "Odontites vernus subsp. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved spring beauty, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully expanded, and is noted for its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
