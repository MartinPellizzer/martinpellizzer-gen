    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites subsp. attica, commonly known as the Athens bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Greece. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a wasp, a mimicry strategy used to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female wasp. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
