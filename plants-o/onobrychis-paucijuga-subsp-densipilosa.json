    "intro": "Onobrychis paucijuga subsp. densipilosa, commonly known as the dense-pilose clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root network. The subspecies is distinguished by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance."
