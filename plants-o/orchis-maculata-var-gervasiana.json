    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. gervasiana, commonly known as the Gervasoni's spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and delicate, pale pink to white flowers. This variant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats. The plant has a short rhizome and produces a single upright flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
