    "intro": "Orobanche purpurea var. ballii, commonly known as the purple witch's butter, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually purple or pink in color, which attract pollinators. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
