It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance and ability to bloom reliably make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
