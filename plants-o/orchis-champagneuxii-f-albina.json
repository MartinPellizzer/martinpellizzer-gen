    "intro": "Orchis champagneuxii f. albina, commonly known as the Champagne orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. This variant is characterized by its pale, almost white flowers, which contrast sharply with the typical purple or green hues of the species. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern France, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a slender rhizome and lance-shaped leaves, typical of many orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and delicate habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
