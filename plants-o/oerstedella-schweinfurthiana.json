It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark and wood surfaces in temperate regions. The thallus is characterized by its greenish-yellow color and lacks distinct lobes. It forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the photosynthetic capability. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
