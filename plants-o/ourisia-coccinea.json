    "intro": "Ourisia coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered ourisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
