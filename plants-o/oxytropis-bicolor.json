It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions.
