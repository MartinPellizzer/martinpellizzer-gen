It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
