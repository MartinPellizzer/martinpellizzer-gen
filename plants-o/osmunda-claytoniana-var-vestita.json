    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana var. vestita, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, cinnamon-brown fiddleheads that unfurl into lush, green fronds. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its growth and helps it spread through vegetative reproduction. Its fronds are divided into a central axis and pinnate leaflets, with the fertile fronds bearing sporangia on the undersides. The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
