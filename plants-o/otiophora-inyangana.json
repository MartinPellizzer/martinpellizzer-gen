    "intro": "Otiophora inyangana, commonly known as the Inyangana lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its greenish-yellow to brownish thallus with a distinct, finely wrinkled surface. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
