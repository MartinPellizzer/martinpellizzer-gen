It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in dry conditions.
