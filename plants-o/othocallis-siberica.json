    "intro": "Othocallis siberica, commonly known as Siberian marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy environments, thriving in poorly drained soils. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that aids in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from its moist habitat. Othocallis siberica is a rare and specialized species, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
