    "intro": "Oryzopsis sibirica, commonly known as Siberian millet, is a grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and other northern regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain minute grains, which are adapted for survival in harsh environmental conditions. Oryzopsis sibirica is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the flora in its native ecosystems."
