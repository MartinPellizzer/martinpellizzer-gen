It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, often branched stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies."
