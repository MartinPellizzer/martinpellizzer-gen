    "intro": "Othonna litoralis, commonly known as the coastal othonna, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Othonna litoralis is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
