    "intro": "Ornithogalum billardierei, commonly known as the slender star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which serves as a storage organ and allows it to survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy habitats. Ornithogalum billardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
