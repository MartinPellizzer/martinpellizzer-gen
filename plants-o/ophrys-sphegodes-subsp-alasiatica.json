    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. alasiatica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a bee. This species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary adaptations and ecological significance."
