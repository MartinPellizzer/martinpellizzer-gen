    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 godferyana, commonly known as the Godfrey's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pale purple to deep violet. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip. It thrives in woodland habitats and requires partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. Orchis \u00d7 godferyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
