    "intro": "Osbeckia elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed willow herb, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, elliptic-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments. Osbeckia elliptica is valued for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
