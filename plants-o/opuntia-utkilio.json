    "intro": "Opuntia utkilio, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in glochids\u2014tiny, barbed bristles that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in spring, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia utkilio is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick stems and its shallow root system. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
