    "intro": "Oeceoclades maculata, commonly known as the spotted moth orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with distinctive markings. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, arranged in a fan shape around the pseudobulbs. It thrives in well-draining potting media and requires consistent moisture and bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
