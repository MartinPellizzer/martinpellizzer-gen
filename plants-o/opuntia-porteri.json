    "intro": "Opuntia porteri, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia porteri is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from infrequent rains. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
