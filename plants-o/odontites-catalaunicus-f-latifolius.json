    "intro": "Odontites catalaunicus f. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf odontite, is a rare fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds. It features bipinnate leaves with a broad, flat structure, giving it a unique appearance compared to typical odontite species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
