It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in swampy areas. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and slightly pointed at the tips. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. Oncostylis junciformis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
