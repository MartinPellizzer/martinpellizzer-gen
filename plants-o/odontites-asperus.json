    "intro": "Odontites asperus, commonly known as the rough toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in loose spikes and bloom in early spring. Odontites asperus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
