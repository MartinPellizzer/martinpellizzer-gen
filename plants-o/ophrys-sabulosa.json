    "intro": "Ophrys sabulosa, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, with a specialized flower structure that mimics the female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal or dune environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Ophrys sabulosa is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
