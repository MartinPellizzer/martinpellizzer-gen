    "intro": "Orobanche fragrantissima, commonly known as the fragrant broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its highly reduced, often yellowish or reddish stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological and agricultural impacts on its host species."
