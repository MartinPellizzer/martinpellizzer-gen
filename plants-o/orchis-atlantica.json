    "intro": "Orchis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive lip petal. Orchis atlantica thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
