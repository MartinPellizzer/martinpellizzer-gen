    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, erect flowering stems. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, often arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis latifolia."
