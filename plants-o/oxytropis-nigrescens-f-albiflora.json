    "intro": "Oxytropis nigrescens f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Oxytropis nigrescens f. albiflora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats."
