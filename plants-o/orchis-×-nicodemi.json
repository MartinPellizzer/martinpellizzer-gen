    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 nicodemi, commonly known as the Nicod\u00e8me orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which often have a distinctive yellow or greenish lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is typical for many orchid species. The hybrid is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
