    "intro": "Ottonia stationis, commonly known as the rock wallflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on cliffs or slopes where it can anchor itself firmly. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Ottonia stationis is known for its bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
