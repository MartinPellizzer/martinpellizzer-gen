    "intro": "Oxytropis compacta, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or yellow-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Oxytropis compacta is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
