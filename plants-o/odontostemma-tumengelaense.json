    "intro": "Odontostemma tumengelaense, commonly known as the KwaZulu-Natal orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows in rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in areas with limited soil and moisture. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate blooms that are often overlooked due to their size. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
