    "intro": "Oryzopsis molinioides f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine rice grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, two-lobed glumes and three-branched lemma. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to harsh mountainous conditions."
