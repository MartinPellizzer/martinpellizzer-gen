    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. grisebachii, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is often found parasitizing grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in regulating host plant populations in certain ecosystems."
