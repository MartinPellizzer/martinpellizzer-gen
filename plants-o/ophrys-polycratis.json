It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry.
