It features narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy and grow from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum reflexum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
