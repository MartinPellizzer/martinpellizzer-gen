    "intro": "Orobanche fasciculata var. franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the western United States, particularly California. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its roots are specialized for attaching to the roots of host plants. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its environment."
