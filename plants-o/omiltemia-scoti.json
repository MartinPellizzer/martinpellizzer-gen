    "intro": "Omiltemia scoti, commonly known as the Scottish omiltemia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of Scotland. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Omiltemia scoti is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
