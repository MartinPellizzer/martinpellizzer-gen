    "intro": "Orchis olocheilos var. sanasunitensis, commonly known as the Sanasunit Mountain Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in specific high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often violet or purple-colored flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes erect stems with few leaves and a single, showy floral spike. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
