It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a vibrant purple or reddish-purple, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This variety is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and over-collection."
