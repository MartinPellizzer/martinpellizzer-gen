    "intro": "Othonna globosa, commonly known as the globular othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its compact growth habit and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna globosa is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
