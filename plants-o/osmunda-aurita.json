    "intro": "Osmunda aurita, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and aquatic habitat. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and India, and thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with both male and female spore-producing structures on the same frond. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, tooth-like projections along the margins. Osmunda aurita is also notable for its ability to absorb heavy metals from water, making it a potential candidate for phytoremediation efforts."
