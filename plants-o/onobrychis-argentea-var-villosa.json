    "intro": "Onobrychis argentea var. villosa, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, linear pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Silver vetch is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
