    "intro": "Ostrya baileyi, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like male flowers and small, nut-like female flowers that develop into woody fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Ostrya baileyi is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along stream banks."
