It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its seed pods develop after flowering and contain several small, round seeds. Orobus hispidulus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
