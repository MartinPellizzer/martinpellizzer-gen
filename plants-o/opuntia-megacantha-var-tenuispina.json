    "intro": "Opuntia megacantha var. tenuispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and fiber."
