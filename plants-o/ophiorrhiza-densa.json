    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza densa, commonly known as the dense-leaf marsh plant, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are an important food source for various birds and small mammals. Ophiorrhiza densa plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is often used in traditional medicine."
