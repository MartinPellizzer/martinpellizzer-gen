    "intro": "Oxydectes leucophlebia, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often adorned with white veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Oxydectes leucophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
