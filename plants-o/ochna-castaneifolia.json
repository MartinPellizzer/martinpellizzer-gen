It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often palmately lobed and resemble the leaves of chestnut trees. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Ochna castaneifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions."
