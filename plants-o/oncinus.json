    "intro": "Oncinus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads, which are actually clusters of tiny florets. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are usually silvery or grayish, covered in a fine layer of hair that helps reduce water loss. Oncinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
