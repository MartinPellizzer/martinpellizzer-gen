    "intro": "Opuntia tomentosa var. hernandezii, commonly known as the hairy prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in dense white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
