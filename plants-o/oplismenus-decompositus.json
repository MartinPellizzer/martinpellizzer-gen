    "intro": "Oplismenus decompositus, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color. Oplismenus decompositus is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
