    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. toroslaria, commonly known as the Hungarian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a yellow and brownish-green pouch with intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of a bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
