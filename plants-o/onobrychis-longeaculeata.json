    "intro": "Onobrychis longeaculeata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Onobrychis longeaculeata thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and soil improvement practices. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
