    "intro": "Oxytropis erecta, commonly known as the erect milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Oxytropis erecta is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
