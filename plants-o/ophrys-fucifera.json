    "intro": "Ophrys fucifera, commonly known as the brown bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually brown or dark green, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry. Ophrys fucifera is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, prominent lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen."
