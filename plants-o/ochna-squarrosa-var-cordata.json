It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
