    "intro": "Orthosia congesta var. brachystephana, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed orthosia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to thrive in high-altitude, cool environments. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stems compared to other forms of Orthosia congesta, making it a unique and visually distinct species within its genus."
