    "intro": "Orchis flexuosa, commonly known as the bent orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy flower that is usually violet or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, and the plant produces a distinctive, curved flower spike. Orchis flexuosa is known for its ecological importance, supporting pollinators and thriving in specific, often nutrient-poor habitats."
