    "intro": "Onychium krebsii, commonly known as the alpine onychium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive bracts and often edible roots. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of pink or white, and it produces distinctive seed capsules that disperse its seeds efficiently. Due to its habitat specificity, Onychium krebsii is considered a rare and specialized species."
