    "intro": "Ornithogalum horologicum, commonly known as the clock lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a umbel-like cluster. It blooms during the summer months, and its flowering period is often associated with the time of day, giving it its common name. The plant is known for its toxic properties, containing compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
