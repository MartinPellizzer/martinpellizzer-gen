    "intro": "Opuntia serpentina, commonly known as the snake cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia serpentina is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. Its succulent stems store water, making it well-suited for survival in desert conditions."
