    "intro": "Ormiscus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that often hang downward, giving it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble those of true dandelions. Its leaves are lance-shaped, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Ormiscus pendulus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments."
