    "intro": "Ononis angustissima var. longifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the western United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in arid environments. It is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions."
