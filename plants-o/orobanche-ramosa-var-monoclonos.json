    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. monoclonos, commonly known as the narrow-leaf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a taproot and a flowering stem. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers, typically in clusters, and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume family, and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
