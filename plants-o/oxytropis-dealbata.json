    "intro": "Oxytropis dealbata, commonly known as the white locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxytropis dealbata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
