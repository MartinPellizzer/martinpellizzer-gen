It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers, which are typically arranged in inflorescences at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The subspecies apiculata is distinguished by its acuminate leaf tips and slightly different floral structures compared to other subspecies of Oedera calycina."
