    "intro": "Odontosoria chinensis var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
