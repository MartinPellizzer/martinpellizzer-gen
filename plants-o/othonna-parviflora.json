    "intro": "Othonna parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered othonna, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, often glandular, foliage. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Othonna parviflora is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
