    "intro": "Odontarrhena skopjensis, commonly known as the Skopje orchid, is a rare endemic species native to the Balkan region. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
