    "intro": "Ocotea cufodontisii, commonly known as the Guianese ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela, Colombia, and Guyana. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves, which emit a distinct scent when crushed. It typically grows in humid, lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
