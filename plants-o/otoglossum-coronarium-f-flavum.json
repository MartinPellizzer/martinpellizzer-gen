    "intro": "Otoglossum coronarium f. flavum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered crown orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
