    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna behen subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-haired leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against UV radiation. This subspecies is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
