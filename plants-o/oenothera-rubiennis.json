    "intro": "Oenothera rubiennis, commonly known as the redstem evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Oenothera rubiennis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
