    "intro": "Ophrys borealis, commonly known as the northern bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous or alpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys borealis is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized reproductive mechanisms."
