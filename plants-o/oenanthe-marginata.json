    "intro": "Oenanthe marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water sources such as streams and ditches. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinct margin that is often wavy or toothed. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer."
