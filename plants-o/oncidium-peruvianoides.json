    "intro": "Oncidium peruvianoides, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It features a pseudobulb with fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its often-dry habitat. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with intricate patterns. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Oncidium peruvianoides is popular among orchid growers for its longevity and ease of care."
