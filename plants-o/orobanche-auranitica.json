    "intro": "Orobanche auranitica, commonly known as the yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
