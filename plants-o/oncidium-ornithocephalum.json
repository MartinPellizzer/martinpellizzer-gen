It features showy, brightly colored flowers that resemble a bird's head, with a distinctive yellow and orange coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium ornithocephalum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
