    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. imbricata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery fronds. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodlands and wetlands. The plant has a tall, central sterile stem with a cluster of fertile fronds at the top, which produce spores. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The varietal form, imbricata, is distinguished by its tightly overlapping, scale-like fronds that give it a unique, compact appearance."
