    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. marmorata, commonly known as the marbled bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs or woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
