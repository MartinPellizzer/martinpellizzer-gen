    "intro": "Ophrys pollinensis, commonly known as the Pollin's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles the female wasp, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a wasp's abdomen. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragility, Ophrys pollinensis is considered a vulnerable species."
