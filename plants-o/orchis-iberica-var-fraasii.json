    "intro": "Orchis iberica var. fraasii, commonly known as the Iberian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to parts of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in calcareous soils and open woodland habitats. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single, showy violet or purple flower that blooms in late spring. Its orchid-like appearance is characterized by intricate floral structures and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
