    "intro": "Orobanche loricata subvar. synomora, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves, which are typically absent in other Orobanche species. This subspecies is often found growing on the roots of various leguminous plants, such as those in the genera Astragalus and Medicago. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and they are clustered in small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its host plants and the surrounding environment."
