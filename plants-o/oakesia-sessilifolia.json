    "intro": "Oakesia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf oakesia, is a flowering plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, which is a key identifying feature. Oakesia sessilifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential use in traditional medicine."
