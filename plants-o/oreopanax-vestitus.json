    "intro": "Oreopanax vestitus, commonly known as the hairy oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a common feature among members of the Araceae family. Oreopanax vestitus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
