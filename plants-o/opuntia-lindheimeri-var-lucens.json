    "intro": "Opuntia lindheimeri var. lucens, commonly known as the shining prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are typically bright green and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy pads. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
