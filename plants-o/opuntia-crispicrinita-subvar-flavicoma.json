    "intro": "Opuntia crispicrinita subvar. flavicoma, commonly known as the golden hair opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems covered in clusters of short, spiny segments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, edible fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in drought conditions."
