    "intro": "Orlaya, commonly known as the \"water dropwort,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, including Orlaya grandiflora, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. These plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are usually alternate and pinnately divided, giving them a delicate, fern-like appearance. Orlaya species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and streambanks."
