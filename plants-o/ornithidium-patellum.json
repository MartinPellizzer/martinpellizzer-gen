    "intro": "Ornithidium patellum, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Ornithidium patellum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
