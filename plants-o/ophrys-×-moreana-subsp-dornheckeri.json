    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 moreana subsp. dornheckeri, commonly known as the Dornhecker's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
