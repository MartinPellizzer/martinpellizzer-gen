    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. serotina, commonly known as the late-blooming bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowering period occurs later in the growing season, usually from late summer to early autumn. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subvariety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
