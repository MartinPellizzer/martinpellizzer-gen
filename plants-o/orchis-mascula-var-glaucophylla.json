    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It features a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet to purple coloration. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, which gives the variety its common name. The plant produces a single, spurred orchid flower with a lip that is typically darker in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
