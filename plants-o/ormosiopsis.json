    "intro": "Ormosiopsis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ormosiopsis species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in woodland or savanna habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated for their unique foliage."
