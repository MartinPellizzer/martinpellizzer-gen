    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei var. montana, commonly known as the mountain prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to rocky soils and high altitudes. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
