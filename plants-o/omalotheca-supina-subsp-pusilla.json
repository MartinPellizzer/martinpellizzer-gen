    "intro": "Omalotheca supina subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf star-leaf, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, waxy leaves that are arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover."
