    "intro": "Onosma urumensis, commonly known as the Urumqi onosma, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Onosma urumensis is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
