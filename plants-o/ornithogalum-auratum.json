    "intro": "Ornithogalum auratum, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
