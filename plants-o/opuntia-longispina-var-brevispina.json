    "intro": "Opuntia longispina var. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines are shorter and more clustered compared to other Opuntia species, providing a distinct appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its reduced leaf surface."
