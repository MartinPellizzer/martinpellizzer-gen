    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. lapethica, commonly known as the Lapethic bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological and evolutionary adaptations."
