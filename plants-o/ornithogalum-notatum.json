It features a bulbous stem that produces a cluster of white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
