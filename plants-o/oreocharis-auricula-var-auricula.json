    "intro": "Oreocharis auricula var. auricula, commonly known as the auricled oreocharis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
