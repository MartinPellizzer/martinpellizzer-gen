    "intro": "Oxalis flagellata, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrels, with each leaflet being oval and slightly serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Oxalis flagellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and floral display."
