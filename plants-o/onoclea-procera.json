    "intro": "Onoclea procera, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a perennial fern native to North America. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving them a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. The botanical structure of Onoclea procera reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
