    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 petterssonii nothosubsp. incantata, commonly known as the incantata orchid, is a hybrid species within the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its morphology reflects a blend of its parent species, Orchis petterssonii and Orchis \u00d7 petterssonii, with distinctive floral structures. This nothosubspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic and morphological traits."
