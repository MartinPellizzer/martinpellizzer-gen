    "intro": "Oenanthe hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are finely divided and somewhat fern-like, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Oenanthe hungarica is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
