    "intro": "Odontoglossum crispum var. lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's toothed orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and violet. The plant prefers cool, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. It has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, and it produces aerial roots that aid in its climbing habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
