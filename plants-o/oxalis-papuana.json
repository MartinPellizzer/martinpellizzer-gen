    "intro": "Oxalis papuana, commonly known as the papuan wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common sorrel. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, thriving in moist, well-drained conditions. Oxalis papuana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
