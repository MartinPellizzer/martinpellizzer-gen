    "intro": "Omphalea cauliflora, commonly known as the purple leaf sponge or swamp sponge, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems, a characteristic known as cauliflorous growth. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, black seeds. Omphalea cauliflora is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
