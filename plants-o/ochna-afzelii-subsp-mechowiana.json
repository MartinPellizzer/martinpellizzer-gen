    "intro": "Ochna afzelii subsp. mechowiana, commonly known as the Mechow's ochna, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of East Africa. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, shedding its leaves during the dry season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in its natural habitat."
