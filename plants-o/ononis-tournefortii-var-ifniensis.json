    "intro": "Ononis tournefortii var. ifniensis, commonly known as the Ifni oxyphila, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, showing a high degree of adaptation to drought conditions. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and resilience in harsh environments."
