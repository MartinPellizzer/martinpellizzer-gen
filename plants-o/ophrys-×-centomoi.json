    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 centomoi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows across southern Europe. Its flowers are usually yellow or brownish in color, with a complex structure that facilitates mimicry of female wasps or bees. This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the labellum secretes a chemical that attracts male insects."
