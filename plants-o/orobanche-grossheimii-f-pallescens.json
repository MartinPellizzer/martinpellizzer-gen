    "intro": "Orobanche grossheimii f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
