    "intro": "Onosma hookeri var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered onosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often grow from a basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
