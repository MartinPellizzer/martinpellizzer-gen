It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
