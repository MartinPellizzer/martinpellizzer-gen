    "intro": "Ochna aschersoniana, commonly known as the African star, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Ochna aschersoniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
