    "intro": "Odontites viscosus subsp. viscosus, commonly known as sticky toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
