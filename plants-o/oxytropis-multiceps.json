    "intro": "Oxytropis multiceps, commonly known as the many-headed locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy purple or pink flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
