    "intro": "Oxytropis bungei, commonly known as the Bunge's locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it can be toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
