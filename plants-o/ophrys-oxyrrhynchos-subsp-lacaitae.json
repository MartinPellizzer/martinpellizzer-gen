    "intro": "Ophrys oxyrrhynchos subsp. lacaitae, commonly known as the lacaita bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like appearance that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination through mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
