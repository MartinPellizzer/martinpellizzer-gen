    "intro": "Orobanche coccinea, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as tomatoes and other members of the Solanaceae family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that are often mistaken for those of its host. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on the presence of a suitable host, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield and health of its host plants."
