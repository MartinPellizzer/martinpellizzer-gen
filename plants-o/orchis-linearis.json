    "intro": "Orchis linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a single, slender stem that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often arranged along the stem. Orchis linearis is known for its distinctive floral structure, which includes specialized petals and a labellum adapted for pollination by specific insects."
