    "intro": "Ornithogalum capitatum, commonly known as the clustered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a dense cluster of white, star-shaped flowers on a tall, leafless stem. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
