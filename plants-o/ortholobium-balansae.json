    "intro": "Ortholobium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae burr legume, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences. The seeds are enclosed in hairy, woody pods, which contribute to its common name due to their rough, bur-like appearance."
