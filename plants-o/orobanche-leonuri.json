    "intro": "Orobanche leonuri, commonly known as the milkweed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often parasitizing plants in the legume family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients through specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
