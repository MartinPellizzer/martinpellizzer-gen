It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
