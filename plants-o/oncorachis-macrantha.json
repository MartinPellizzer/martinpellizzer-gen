    "intro": "Oncorachis macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Oncorachis macrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
