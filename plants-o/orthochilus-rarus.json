    "intro": "Orthochilus rarus, commonly known as the rare orchid of the Andes, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes mountains of countries like Bolivia and Peru. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Orthochilus rarus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
