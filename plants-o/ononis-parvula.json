    "intro": "Ononis parvula, commonly known as smallleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, rocky soils in the western United States. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in arid environments. Ononis parvula is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in gravelly slopes and open woodlands."
