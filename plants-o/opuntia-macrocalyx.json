    "intro": "Opuntia macrocalyx, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its thick, waxy skin helps it store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia macrocalyx is also noted for its sharp spines, which provide protection from herbivores."
