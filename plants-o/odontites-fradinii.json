    "intro": "Odontites fradinii, commonly known as the Fradinii toothplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to theApiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, tooth-like appearance, giving it its scientific name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
