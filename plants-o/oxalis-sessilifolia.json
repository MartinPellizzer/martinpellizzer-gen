    "intro": "Oxalis sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Oxalis sessilifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
