    "intro": "Olea chrysophylla, commonly known as the golden-leaf olea, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with its small, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Olea chrysophylla is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
