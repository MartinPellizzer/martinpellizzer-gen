It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant is sensitive to environmental changes, hence its common name, and plays an important role in forest ecosystems."
