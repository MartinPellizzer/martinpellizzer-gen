    "intro": "Opuntia tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and small, fleshy, segmented pads. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by fruit that is typically red or orange in color. Its pads are edible and can be cooked, while the fruit is often consumed fresh or used in beverages. Opuntia tuberosa is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
