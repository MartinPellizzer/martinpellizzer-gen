    "intro": "Ononis glaucescens, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy, often bluish-green leaves, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Ononis glaucescens is typically found in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
