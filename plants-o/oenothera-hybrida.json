    "intro": "Oenothera hybrida, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant produces a unique type of pollen that is released in a sticky, gel-like substance, which helps in pollination by attracting nocturnal insects. Oenothera hybrida is a perennial herb that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is also known for its oil-rich seeds, which have various medicinal and industrial applications."
