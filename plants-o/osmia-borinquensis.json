    "intro": "Osmia borinquensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican alfalfa leafcutter bee, is a solitary bee species native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its black body with metallic green and blue reflections, and it has a distinctive pattern of yellow and black on its abdomen. This bee is primarily a pollinator of leguminous plants, particularly alfalfa, and plays an important role in agricultural ecosystems. Osmia borinquensis is known for its unique behavior of cutting small pieces of leaf to line its nest cells. Due to habitat loss and pesticide use, this species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
