    "intro": "Orchis iberica var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered Iberian orchid, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features a single, erect stem with several whorled leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. Its blooming period occurs between May and July, and it is known for its intricate floral structure typical of orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
