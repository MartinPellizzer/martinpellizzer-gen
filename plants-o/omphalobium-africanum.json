    "intro": "Omphalobium africanum, commonly known as the African sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Omphalobium africanum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used in traditional agriculture and livestock feed."
