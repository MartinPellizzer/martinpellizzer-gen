    "intro": "Onira unguiculata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, while its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
