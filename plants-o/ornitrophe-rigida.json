    "intro": "Ornitrophe rigida, commonly known as the rigid ornithophyte, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale green flowers during the rainy season, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Ornitrophe rigida is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
