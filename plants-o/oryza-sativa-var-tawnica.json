    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. tawnica, commonly known as the tawny rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its unique husk coloration. It is native to Southeast Asia and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than culinary use. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its grain is small and often has a lighter color compared to common rice varieties. This variety is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability to wetland environments."
