    "intro": "Ononis lagopus, commonly known as mountain mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, with small, hairy leaves and pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology includes a creeping stem system that helps it anchor in unstable terrain. Ononis lagopus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
