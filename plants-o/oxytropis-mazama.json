It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis mazama is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
