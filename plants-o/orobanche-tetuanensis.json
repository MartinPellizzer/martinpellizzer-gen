    "intro": "Orobanche tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetuan dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to North Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, erect stem with no true leaves. It is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
