    "intro": "Osmia corymbosa, commonly known as the yellow squash bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee native to North America. It is characterized by its dark brown body with yellow markings on the abdomen and thorax. This species is particularly important for pollinating crops such as squash, pumpkins, and melons. Osmia corymbosa prefers to nest in bare soil or loose, undisturbed ground. Its foraging behavior is highly specialized, making it an efficient pollinator for specific plant species."
