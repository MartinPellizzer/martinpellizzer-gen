It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Ornithogalum pilosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
