    "intro": "Ophrys minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are small, usually less than 1 cm in size, and exhibit a range of colors from greenish-yellow to brown. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys minutiflora is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
