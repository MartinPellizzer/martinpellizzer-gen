    "intro": "Otites sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian grassvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Otites sibiricus is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, arctic or alpine environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
