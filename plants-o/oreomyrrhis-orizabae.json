    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis orizabae, commonly known as the Oaxaca lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble lilies. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreomyrrhis orizabae is considered a conservation concern."
