    "intro": "Ornithogalum conicum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and moths. Ornithogalum conicum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas."
