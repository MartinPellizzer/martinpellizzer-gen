    "intro": "Oxytropis humifusa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
