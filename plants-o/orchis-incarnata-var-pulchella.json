    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. pulchella, commonly known as the showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette. This variant is distinguished by its more vibrant flower color compared to the typical orchis."
