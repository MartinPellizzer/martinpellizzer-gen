    "intro": "Ononis procurrens var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and salt tolerance make it well adapted to harsh maritime environments. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
