    "intro": "Onobrychis ralpbii, commonly known as Ralpbii burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by spiny, three-lobed seed pods. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
