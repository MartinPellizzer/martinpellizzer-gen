    "intro": "Orchis cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces striking, tall spikes of purple or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to survive in arid conditions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild."
