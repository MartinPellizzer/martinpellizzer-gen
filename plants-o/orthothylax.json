    "intro": "Orthothylax, commonly known as the African star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. Orthothylax species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, meaning they attach themselves to trees or rocks for support rather than growing in soil. They require specific environmental conditions, including high light exposure and well-draining substrates, to thrive. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
