    "intro": "Osmia ascendens, commonly known as the ascending mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow body with metallic sheen. The female constructs its nest in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or artificial tunnels, using a mixture of plant resins and soil. Osmia ascendens primarily pollinates wildflowers and fruit trees, playing a vital role in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Its life cycle involves overwintering as a pupa and emerging in the spring to forage and reproduce."
