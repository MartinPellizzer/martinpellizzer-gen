    "intro": "Olea europaea, commonly known as the olive tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-green leaves, which are opposite and oval in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by the familiar olive fruit, which is typically harvested when it is still green. The fruit contains a single stone with a seed inside, and it is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. Olea europaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in human culture."
