    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. bremifera, commonly known as the Bremifera bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. This plant is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles the female wasp, a feature evolved to facilitate pollination by male wasps through mimicry. The flowers are typically pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
