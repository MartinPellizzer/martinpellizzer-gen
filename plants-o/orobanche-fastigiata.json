    "intro": "Orobanche fastigiata, commonly known as the tall broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on the roots of other plants such as legumes and grasses. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike, and its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings and is often difficult to control."
