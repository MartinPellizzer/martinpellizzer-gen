This rice species is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its nutritional value and unique aesthetic properties. The grains are typically smaller and harder than common white rice, with a nutty aroma. It is rich in antioxidants, fiber, and essential minerals, making it a valuable addition to a balanced diet.
