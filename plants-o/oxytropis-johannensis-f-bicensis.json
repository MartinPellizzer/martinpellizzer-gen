    "intro": "Oxytropis johannensis f. bicensis, commonly known as the two-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
