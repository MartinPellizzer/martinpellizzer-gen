    "intro": "Ophioglossum thermale, commonly known as the thermal adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped sporangium and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, upright rhizome and a single, bipinnate leaf. It is often associated with geothermal areas due to its preference for warm, humid microclimates. Ophioglossum thermale is of particular interest to botanists due to its primitive features and limited distribution."
