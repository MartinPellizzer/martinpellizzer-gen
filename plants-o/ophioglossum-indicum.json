    "intro": "Ophioglossum indicum, commonly known as the Indian adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is unique to the Ophioglossaceae family. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lanceolate, with a single, prominent sporophyll at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum indicum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
