    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by capsule fruits that release minute seeds dispersed by water. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza spathulata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
