    "intro": "Othonna ericoides, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the winter months. It is well adapted to arid conditions and requires minimal water once established. Othonna ericoides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
