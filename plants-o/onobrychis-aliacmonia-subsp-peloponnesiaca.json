    "intro": "Onobrychis aliacmonia subsp. peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the Peloponnesian burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands."
