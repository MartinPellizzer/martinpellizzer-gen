    "intro": "Oxalis viscosa, commonly known as the sticky oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Oxalis viscosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers."
