    "intro": "Orchis latifolia subsp. sesquipedalis, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with showy, violet or purple flowers. Its flowers are characterized by a distinct lip and spurred structure, typical of the Orchidaceae family. The subspecies sesquipedalis is distinguished by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of O. latifolia."
