    "intro": "Osvaldoa, commonly known as the \"Mexican bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Mexico and Central America. The plants are typically herbaceous, with showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. Osvaldoa species often grow in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Their botanical interest lies in their unique floral morphology and potential ecological roles in their native habitats."
