    "intro": "Opuntia galeottii, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, whitish glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia galeottii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
