    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandspurry, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, succulent stems. The plant features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
