    "intro": "Opuntia decumbens var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines, with the spines of this variety being notably longer and more pronounced than in other forms. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both its beauty and edible fruits."
