    "intro": "Oreogrammitis reinwardtioides, commonly known as the reinwardt's rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, humid environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense, compact colonies. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it firmly to the substrate. Oreogrammitis reinwardtioides is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
