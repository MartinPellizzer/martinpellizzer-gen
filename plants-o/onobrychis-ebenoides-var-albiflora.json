    "intro": "Onobrychis ebenoides var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features compound leaves with a trifoliate arrangement and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
