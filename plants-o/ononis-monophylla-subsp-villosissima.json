It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
