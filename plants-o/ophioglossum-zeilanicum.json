    "intro": "Ophioglossum zeilanicum, commonly known as the Zeilani grass fern, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and a distinctive, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive system is primitive, relying on spores rather than seeds for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
