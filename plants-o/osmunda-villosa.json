    "intro": "Osmunda villosa, commonly known as the hairy water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Osmunda villosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting biodiversity."
