    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis subsp. brachyarthra, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems, which are covered in spiny areoles and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its delicate, fragile stems that can break easily, hence its common name."
