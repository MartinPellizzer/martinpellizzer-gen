It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
