    "intro": "Ochna stipulacea, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of velvet-like hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Ochna stipulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and seasonal blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
