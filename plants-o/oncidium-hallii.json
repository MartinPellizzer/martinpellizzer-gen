    "intro": "Oncidium hallii, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant yellow and green flowers with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable climates. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium hallii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
