    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subvar. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Prickly Pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
