    "intro": "Orobus pannonicus subsp. velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit Orobus, is a rare endemic plant species found primarily in the Dinaric Alps, particularly in Croatia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone-rich soils, often in mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
