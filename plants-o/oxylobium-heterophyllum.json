    "intro": "Oxylobium heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable oxylobium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its botanical features include stipules, which are small leaf-like structures at the base of the leaf stalks, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Oxylobium heterophyllum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
