    "intro": "Oenocarpus microspadix, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and its ability to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has aerial roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils. Its fruit is a large, woody capsule that contains a single seed. Oenocarpus microspadix plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
