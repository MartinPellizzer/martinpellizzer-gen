    "intro": "Oxalis dentata, commonly known as the toothed wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a red or purple calyx. Oxalis dentata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
