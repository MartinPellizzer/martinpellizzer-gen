    "intro": "Ototropis elegans, commonly known as slender false brome, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Ototropis elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
