    "intro": "Ophioderma, commonly known as the sea hare, is a genus of marine gastropod mollusks belonging to the family Aplysiidae. These creatures are characterized by their soft, gelatinous bodies and often exhibit a variety of colors and patterns. They are found in warm coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a sticky mucus. Ophioderma species play a role in marine ecosystems by feeding on algae and detritus. Their anatomy includes a radula for scraping food and a muscular foot for movement."
