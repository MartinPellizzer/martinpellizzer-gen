    "intro": "Octodon, commonly known as the plains viscacha, is a species of rodent native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Chinchillidae and is characterized by its thick, woolly fur that provides insulation against the cold. The plant in question, however, is not a plant but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, this query is based on a misunderstanding. I can't reply."
