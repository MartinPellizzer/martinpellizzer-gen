    "intro": "Oncidium scansor, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with aerial rhizomes that allow it to climb and attach to trees or other structures. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine pubescence. Oncidium scansor requires bright, indirect light and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
