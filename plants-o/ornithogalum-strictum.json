    "intro": "Ornithogalum strictum, commonly known as the straight-stemmed star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in umbels at the end of leafless stems. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, and it blooms during the warmer months. Ornithogalum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
