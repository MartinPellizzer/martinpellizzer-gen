    "intro": "Oncocarpus ferruginea, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark, which is thick and flaky, providing it with a unique appearance. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its roots form a complex network that helps filter water and supports marine life. Oncocarpus ferruginea is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and high salinity, making it an essential component of mangrove ecosystems."
