    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. mesopotamica, commonly known as the Mesopotamian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
