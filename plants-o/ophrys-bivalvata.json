    "intro": "Ophrys bivalvata, commonly known as the two-valved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small, pale green to yellowish in color, and often have intricate patterns that aid in attracting pollinators. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Ophrys bivalvata is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
