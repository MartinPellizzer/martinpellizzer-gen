    "intro": "Ortholobium umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its clustered, umbrella-like arrangement of small white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in coastal and sandy habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
