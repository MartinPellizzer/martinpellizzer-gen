    "intro": "Oncidium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a pseudobulb with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium constrictum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
