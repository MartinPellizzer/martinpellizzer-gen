    "intro": "Ornithogalum affine, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a bulbous stem that produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant blooms with clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that resemble a star, hence its common name. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Ornithogalum affine is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
