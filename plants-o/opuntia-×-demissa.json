    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 demissa, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in small spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Opuntia \u00d7 demissa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert climates."
