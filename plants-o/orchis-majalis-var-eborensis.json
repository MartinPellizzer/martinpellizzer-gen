    "intro": "Orchis majalis var. eborensis, commonly known as the Alpina Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers with a distinct greenish-blue throat, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and alpine meadows. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
