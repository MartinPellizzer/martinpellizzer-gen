    "intro": "Oplismenus crus-galli var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy goat's rue, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its hairy texture, from which it gets its common name, is a distinctive botanical feature."
