    "intro": "Oenone batrachiifolia, commonly known as the frog's foot or waterleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenone batrachiifolia is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
