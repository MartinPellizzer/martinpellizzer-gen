    "intro": "Odontites tenuifolius subsp. albarracinensis, commonly known as the white-leaved toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often covered with a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
