    "intro": "Oldenlandia ternata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or spiderling, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tiny, three-lobed fruits that contain minute seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, forests, and along stream banks. Oldenlandia ternata is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
