    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to the Mediterranean region. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically shorter than those of the standard Opuntia vulgaris, often reaching only a few inches in height. The plant produces small, rounded pads covered in fine spines, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange, appearing in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its compact size, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and rockeries."
