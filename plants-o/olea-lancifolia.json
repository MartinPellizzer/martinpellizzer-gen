    "intro": "Olea lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf olive, is a small evergreen tree native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round drupes that turn from green to black as they mature. Olea lancifolia is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
