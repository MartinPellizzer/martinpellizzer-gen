    "intro": "Oreosedum gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum sedum, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly in areas with high concentrations of gypsum. Its ability to store water in its leaves makes it well adapted to dry environments. Oreosedum gypsicola is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
