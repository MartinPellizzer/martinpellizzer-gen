    "intro": "Oncidium graminifolium var. filipes, commonly known as the Filiped Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
