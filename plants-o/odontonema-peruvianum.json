    "intro": "Odontonema peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian flame flower, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring glossy, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant is renowned for its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in clusters at the ends of branches. These flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds, which are attracted to their nectar-rich blooms. Odontonema peruvianum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical gardens."
