    "intro": "Orchis bonanniana, commonly known as the Bonannian orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, often greenish or purple-tinted flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
