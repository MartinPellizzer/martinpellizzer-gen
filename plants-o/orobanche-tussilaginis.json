    "intro": "Orobanche tussilaginis, commonly known as the thimbleweed dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on members of the sunflower family, particularly on plants like tussilago (coltsfoot). The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and establishing a connection with the root system of its host. Orobanche tussilaginis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature and ability to reduce the growth of its host plants."
