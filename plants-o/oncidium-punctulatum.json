It is characterized by its vibrant, often yellow or orange flowers with distinctive dark spots. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium punctulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
