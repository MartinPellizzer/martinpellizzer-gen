    "intro": "Orchiodes viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, typically arranged in a fan shape. Orchiodes viridiflorum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
