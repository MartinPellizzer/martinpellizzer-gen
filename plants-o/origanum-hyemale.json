    "intro": "Origanum hyemale, commonly known as bear's garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like mint and thyme. The plant features woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor when crushed. Its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Origanum hyemale is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antimicrobial properties."
