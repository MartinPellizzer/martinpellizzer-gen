    "intro": "Origanum hirtum var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, often with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
