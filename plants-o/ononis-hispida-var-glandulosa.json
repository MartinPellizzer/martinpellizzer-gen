    "intro": "Ononis hispida var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry grasslands and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a resilient species adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
