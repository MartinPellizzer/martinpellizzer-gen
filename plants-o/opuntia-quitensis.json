    "intro": "Opuntia quitensis, commonly known as the Quechua prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits similar to other opuntia species. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Opuntia quitensis is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
