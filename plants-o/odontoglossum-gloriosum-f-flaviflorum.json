    "intro": "Odontoglossum gloriosum f. flaviflorum, commonly known as the Yellow-flowered Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically more vibrant than those of the parent species. The plant has erect, hairy pseudobulbs and linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It blooms during the warmer months, producing clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its unique and colorful display."
