    "intro": "Ochrosia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant ochrosia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces large, showy white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are leathery and oval-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the bright flowers. Ochrosia grandiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical gardens."
