    "intro": "Ophiurinella, commonly known as the sea lily, is a type of echinoderm belonging to the class Crinoidea. It is characterized by its feathery arms, which are used for filter feeding, and a central stem that attaches it to the seafloor. The plant has a complex internal structure with a calcareous skeleton that provides support. Ophiurinella thrives in marine environments, particularly in shallow waters with good water flow. Its presence is often an indicator of a healthy and stable ecosystem."
