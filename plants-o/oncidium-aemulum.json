    "intro": "Oncidium aemulum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble golden coins, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium aemulum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
