    "intro": "Oncidium papilio var. majus, commonly known as the Orchid Butterfly, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with irregular rainfall. The flowers bloom sequentially along the stem, creating a long-lasting display that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
