    "intro": "Orobanche pancicii f. melanochroa, commonly known as the dark-chromed broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to brownish stem and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes plants in the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
