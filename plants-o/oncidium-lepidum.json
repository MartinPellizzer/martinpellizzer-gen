    "intro": "Oncidium lepidum, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with white markings, which resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically broad and grass-like, arranged in a fan shape. Oncidium lepidum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
