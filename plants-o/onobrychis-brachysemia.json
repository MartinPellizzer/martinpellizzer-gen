    "intro": "Onobrychis brachysemia, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can be used in ecological restoration projects."
