    "intro": "Oncidium galianoi, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a fan shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in drier conditions. Oncidium galianoi prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting mix for optimal growth."
