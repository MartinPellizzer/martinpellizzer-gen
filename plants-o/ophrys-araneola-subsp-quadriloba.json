    "intro": "Ophrys araneola subsp. quadriloba, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flower structure, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy orchid flower with a complex morphology that resembles a spider, aiding in attracting specific pollinators. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
