    "intro": "Oxytropis purpurea, commonly known as purple locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of purple to pink flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis purpurea is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and water-conserving features."
