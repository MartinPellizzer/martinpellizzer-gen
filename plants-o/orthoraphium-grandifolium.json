    "intro": "Orthoraphium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf orthoraphium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Orthoraphium grandifolium is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
