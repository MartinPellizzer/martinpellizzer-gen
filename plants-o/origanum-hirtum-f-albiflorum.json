It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its striking white or pale pink flowers. The plant features aromatic, silver-green leaves that emit a strong minty scent when crushed. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and mild, less pungent flavor compared to common oregano."
