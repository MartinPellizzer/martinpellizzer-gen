    "intro": "Oberonia asperula, commonly known as the rough-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understorey of tropical rainforests. The plant features a slender, upright stem with several oval-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in a spike, with a distinctive, spurred lip. Oberonia asperula is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
