    "intro": "Orobanche artemisiae, commonly known as the Artemisia broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of plants in the sunflower family. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, and it can significantly affect the growth of its host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
