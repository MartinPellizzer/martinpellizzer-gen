    "intro": "Opuntia ficus-indica var. saboten, commonly known as the Japanese prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southern regions of Japan. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The variety is cultivated for both ornamental purposes and as a source of food and medicinal compounds."
