    "intro": "Oenothera littoralis, commonly known as the coastal evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Oenothera littoralis is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments with minimal water and nutrient availability."
