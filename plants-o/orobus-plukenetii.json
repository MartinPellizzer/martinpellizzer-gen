    "intro": "Orobus plukenetii, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and dry environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme heat and drought. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually reduced to small scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Orobus plukenetii is also known for its ability to survive in low-nutrient soils, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
