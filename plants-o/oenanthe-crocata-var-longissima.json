    "intro": "Oenanthe crocata var. longissima, commonly known as the long-stemmed cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves, and it is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
