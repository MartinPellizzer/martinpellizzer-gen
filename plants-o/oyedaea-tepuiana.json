    "intro": "Oyedaea tepuiana, commonly known as the Tepuian star-flower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, while its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Oyedaea tepuiana is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its high-altitude ecosystem."
