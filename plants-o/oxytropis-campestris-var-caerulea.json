    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris var. caerulea, commonly known as blue field vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to violet pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
