    "intro": "Opuntia tortispina, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia tortispina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
