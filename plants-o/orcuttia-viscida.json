    "intro": "Orcuttia viscida, commonly known as the viscid orcuttia, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of California and Nevada. It is a perennial herb with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orcuttia viscida is considered a rare and endangered species."
