    "intro": "Orchis morio var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered early orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, lance-shaped leaves. This variety typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in calcareous soils. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, usually with 4\u20138 blooms, and is known for its ephemeral blooming period in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
