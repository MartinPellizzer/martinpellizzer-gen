    "intro": "Opuntia leptocaulis var. stipata, commonly known as the stippled prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded shape with flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The pads are covered with fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight."
