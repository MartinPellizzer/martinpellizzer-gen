    "intro": "Oncidium aloisii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium aloisii requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain optimal growth and flowering."
