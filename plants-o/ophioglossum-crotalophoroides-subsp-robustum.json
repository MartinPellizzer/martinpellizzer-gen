    "intro": "Ophioglossum crotalophoroides subsp. robustum, commonly known as the robust mountain adder's mouth, is a rare fern-like plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the genus Ophioglossum, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with a single, lanceolate, and often hairy leaf. Its spores are produced in sporangia that are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure called a sporophyll. This subspecies is particularly notable for its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
