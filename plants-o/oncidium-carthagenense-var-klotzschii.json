It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces numerous flowering spikes that can bloom multiple times a year. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
