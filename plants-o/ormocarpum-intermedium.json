    "intro": "Ormocarpum intermedium, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and sometimes hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Ormocarpum intermedium is often found in coastal dunes and other disturbed habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
