    "intro": "Oxytropis oxyphylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can fix atmospheric nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. Oxytropis oxyphylloides is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
