    "intro": "Oreobolus distichus, commonly known as the two-rowed sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Oreobolus distichus is often found in coastal dunes and inland sand plains, showcasing its resilience to harsh environments."
