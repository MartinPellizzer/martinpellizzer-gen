    "intro": "Onobrychis echinus, commonly known as the spiked vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Onobrychis echinus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and as a forage plant."
