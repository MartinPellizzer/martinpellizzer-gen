It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
