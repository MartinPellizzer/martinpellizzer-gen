    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-loving fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that help reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
