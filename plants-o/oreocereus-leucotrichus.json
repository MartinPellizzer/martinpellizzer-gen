    "intro": "Oreocereus leucotrichus, commonly known as the white-haired candelabra cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive, branched stem that resembles a candelabra. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are covered in white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
