    "intro": "Oenothera boothii subsp. rutila, commonly known as the yellow evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that open in the evening, a trait typical of many species in the genus Oenothera. The plant produces slender, branching stems and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal insects such as moths and bats."
