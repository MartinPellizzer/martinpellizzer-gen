    "intro": "Odontochilus seranicus, commonly known as the golden tooth orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling teeth, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
