The plant produces striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which are often used for ornamental purposes. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
