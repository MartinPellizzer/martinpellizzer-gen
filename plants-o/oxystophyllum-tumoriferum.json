    "intro": "Oxystophyllum tumoriferum, commonly known as the tumor-bearing liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocks. The plant is characterized by its leafy structures with distinct, raised bumps or tumors on the surface of its thallus. These tumors are thought to be involved in the plant's reproductive processes. Oxystophyllum tumoriferum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
