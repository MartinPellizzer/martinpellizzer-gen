    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera subsp. hayekii, commonly known as the Hayek's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctively shaped labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
