    "intro": "Oenothera tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant has four narrow, wing-like petals that give it its common name, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Oenothera tetraptera is also known for its ability to self-pollinate and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
