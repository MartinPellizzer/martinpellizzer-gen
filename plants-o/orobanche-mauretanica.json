    "intro": "Orobanche mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Medicago, in arid and semi-arid regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
