    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 martini subsp. ragonesii, commonly known as the ragonesii orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its floral structure includes a distinctive labellum that mimics female bees, attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
