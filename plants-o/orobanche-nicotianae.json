    "intro": "Orobanche nicotianae, commonly known as the tobacco broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in association with members of the Solanaceae family, such as tobacco and nightshade species. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host root exudates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
