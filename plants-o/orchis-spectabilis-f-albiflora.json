    "intro": "Orchis spectabilis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered showy orchis, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to parts of Europe and Asia. This variant is distinguished by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical purple or violet hues of the species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single spike of showy, lance-shaped flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral morphology and its role in pollination by specific insect species."
