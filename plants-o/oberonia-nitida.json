It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It has a short, fleshy stem and produces aerial roots that help it absorb moisture from the air. Oberonia nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
