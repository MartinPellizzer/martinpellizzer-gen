It is characterized by its fleshy, often sticky leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny environments. Its subspecific classification highlights its distinct adaptations to the Mediterranean climate."
