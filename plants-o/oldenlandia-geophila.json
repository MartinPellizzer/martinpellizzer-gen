    "intro": "Oldenlandia geophila, commonly known as the ground ivy or false pennywort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground, with small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in gardens and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain areas."
