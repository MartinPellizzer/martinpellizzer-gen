    "intro": "Ophiomeris janeirensis, commonly known as the Janeire's sea holly, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking, blue-violet ray florets and a central disk of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Ophiomeris janeirensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
