    "intro": "Oxytropis parryi, commonly known as Parry's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis parryi is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
