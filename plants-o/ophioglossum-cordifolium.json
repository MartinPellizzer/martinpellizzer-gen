    "intro": "Ophioglossum cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad, heart-shaped leaf that emerges from a short, tubular sheath. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the base of the leaf. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
