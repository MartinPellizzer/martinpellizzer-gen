    "intro": "Oncidium auriculatoides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that resembles a small ear, hence its species name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium auriculatoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
