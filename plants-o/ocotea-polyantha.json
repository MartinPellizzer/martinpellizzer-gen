    "intro": "Ocotea polyantha, commonly known as the pink-leafed ocotea, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that often display a striking pink or reddish hue, especially when young. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark purple or black berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Ocotea polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
