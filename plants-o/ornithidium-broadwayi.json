    "intro": "Ornithidium broadwayi, commonly known as the Broadway orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks, where it can thrive in the understory. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pink or purple in color. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Ornithidium broadwayi is considered endangered in many regions."
