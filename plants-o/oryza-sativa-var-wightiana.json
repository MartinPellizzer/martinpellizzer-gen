    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's rice, is a lesser-known variant of the rice species. It is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its slender stalks and small, rice-like grains. This variety is typically found in wetland environments and is adapted to thrive in flooded conditions. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a flowering structure similar to other rice species. Due to its limited cultivation and genetic distinctiveness, it holds potential value for rice breeding programs."
