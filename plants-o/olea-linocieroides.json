    "intro": "Olea linocieroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved olive, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Olea linocieroides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its leaves and fruits have been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a source of oil and in local medicine."
