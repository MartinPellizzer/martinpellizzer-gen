    "intro": "Olax wildemanii, commonly known as the Wildeman's olax, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
