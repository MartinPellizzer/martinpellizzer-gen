    "intro": "Opuntia glomerata var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
