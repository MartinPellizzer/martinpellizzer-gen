    "intro": "Ononis biflora subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its fruits are follicles that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
