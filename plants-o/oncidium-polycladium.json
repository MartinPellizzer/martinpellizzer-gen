    "intro": "Oncidium polycladium, commonly known as the Orchid of the Forest, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its clustered, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous small, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium polycladium is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
