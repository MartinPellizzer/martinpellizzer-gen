It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Orthosiphon truncatus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
