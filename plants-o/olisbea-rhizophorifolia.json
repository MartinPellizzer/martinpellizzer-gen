    "intro": "Olisbea rhizophorifolia, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its rhizomes are adapted to tolerate saltwater, allowing it to flourish in intertidal zones. Olisbea rhizophorifolia is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
