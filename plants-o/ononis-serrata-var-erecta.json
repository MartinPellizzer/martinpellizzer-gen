    "intro": "Ononis serrata var. erecta, commonly known as the erect hedgehog bean, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is often used in dry gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
