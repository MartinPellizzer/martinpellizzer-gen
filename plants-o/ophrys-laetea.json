    "intro": "Ophrys laetea, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Ophrys laetea is a perennial herb with a short rhizome and narrow, linear leaves."
