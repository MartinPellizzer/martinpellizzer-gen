    "intro": "Opulaster alternans, commonly known as the alternate opulaster, is a lesser-known flowering plant belonging to the family Loganiaceae. It is characterized by its alternate leaf arrangement and small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features include simple, ovate leaves with a smooth margin and a short, stout stem. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
