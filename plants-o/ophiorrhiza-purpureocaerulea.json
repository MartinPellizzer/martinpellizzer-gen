It is a small, shrub-like plant that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually a vibrant purple or blue-green color. It has a unique ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils, which is essential for its survival in tidal zones. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal environments and supporting local biodiversity."
