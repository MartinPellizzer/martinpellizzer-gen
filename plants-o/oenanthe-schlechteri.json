    "intro": "Oenanthe schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's hemlock, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are somewhat similar to those of poison hemlock, though it is less toxic. Oenanthe schlechteri is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
