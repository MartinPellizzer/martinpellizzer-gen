    "intro": "Orthocarpus parryi, commonly known as the Parry's orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are compound, with a fern-like appearance, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Orthocarpus parryi is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
