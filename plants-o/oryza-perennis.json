    "intro": "Oryza perennis, commonly known as the perennial rice, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant is notable for its ability to regrow from its rhizomes after flowering, making it a candidate for sustainable agriculture. Its botanical features include inflorescences that form panicles, which produce small, white flowers. Oryza perennis has been studied for its potential to improve rice cultivation by reducing the need for annual planting."
