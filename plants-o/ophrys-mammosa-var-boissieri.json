It features a rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure on the lip. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is typically found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its specialized habitat and floral morphology, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
