    "intro": "Oberonia gracillima, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid undergrowth. Oberonia gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
