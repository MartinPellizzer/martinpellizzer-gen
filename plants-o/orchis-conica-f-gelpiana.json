    "intro": "Orchis conica f. gelpiana, commonly known as the Gelpian spur orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and prefers moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and purple, with a striking contrast that enhances its visual appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
