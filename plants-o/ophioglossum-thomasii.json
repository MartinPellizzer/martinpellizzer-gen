    "intro": "Ophioglossum thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is positioned on a stalk at the base of its leaves. The plant has a distinctive appearance with long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Ophioglossum thomasii has a very limited distribution, often found in specific habitats such as cypress swamps and wet pine forests. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
