    "intro": "Oberonia kaniensis, commonly known as the Kani's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia kaniensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical research."
