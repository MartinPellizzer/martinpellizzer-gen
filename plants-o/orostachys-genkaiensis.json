It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, rosette-forming leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Orostachys genkaiensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
