    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 clandestina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers, which often appear in clusters and are adorned with intricate patterns resembling ghostly faces. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural, often arid or semi-arid habitats. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Orchis \u00d7 clandestina is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
