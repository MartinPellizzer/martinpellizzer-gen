    "intro": "Ononis dumosa, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal across open landscapes."
