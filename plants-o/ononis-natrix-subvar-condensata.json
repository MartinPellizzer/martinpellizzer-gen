    "intro": "Ononis natrix subvar. condensata, commonly known as the dense knotweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils, making it a resilient species. The plant is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
