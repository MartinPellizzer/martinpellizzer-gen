    "intro": "Oliveriana pseudoegregia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and long, pale green leaves that resemble those of its host tree. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often blooming in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to survive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as endangered in many regions."
