    "intro": "Orobanche oxyloba var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, and is found in temperate regions of Europe. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
