    "intro": "Odontites cebennensis subsp. olotensis, commonly known as the Olot Valley toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, toothed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
