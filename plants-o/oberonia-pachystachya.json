It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Oberonia pachystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
