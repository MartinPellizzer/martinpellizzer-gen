    "intro": "Otholobium incanum, commonly known as the silver everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Otholobium incanum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
