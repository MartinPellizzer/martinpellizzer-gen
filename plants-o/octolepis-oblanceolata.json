    "intro": "Octolepis oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Octolepis oblanceolata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
