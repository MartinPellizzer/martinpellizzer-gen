    "intro": "Opercularia acolytantha, commonly known as the small opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The lichen forms a thin, continuous layer on rock surfaces, often in shaded, humid environments. It is found primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a green alga or cyanobacterium."
