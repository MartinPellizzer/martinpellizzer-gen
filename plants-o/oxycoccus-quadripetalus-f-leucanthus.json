    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered cranberry, is a botanical variant of the cranberry plant native to northern regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on acidic, wet soils. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically less acidic than those of the common cranberry. Its white flowers, which appear in late summer, are distinct from the typical pink or red blooms of the species. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to wetland environments."
