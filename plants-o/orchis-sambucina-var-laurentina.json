    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. laurentina, commonly known as the Laurentian orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features dark purple to violet petals with a distinctive yellow-green throat, and its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
