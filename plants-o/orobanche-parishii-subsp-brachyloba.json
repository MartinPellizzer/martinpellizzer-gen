    "intro": "Orobanche parishii subsp. brachyloba, commonly known as the short-stalked broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in disturbed or arid habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
