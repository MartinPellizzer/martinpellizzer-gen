    "intro": "Ophrys corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbier's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-brown coloration and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. It thrives in specific microhabitats, such as calcareous soils, and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys corbariensis is considered a vulnerable species."
