It is a member of the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are clustered in racemes, often with a distinctive corolla that curves backward.
