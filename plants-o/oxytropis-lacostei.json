It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which can make it an invasive species in certain ecosystems. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, and is often found in regions with low precipitation. Oxytropis lacostei is also notable for its toxic properties, which can affect livestock that consume it."
