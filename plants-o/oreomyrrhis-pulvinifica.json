    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis pulvinifica, commonly known as the Pacific coast lily, is a rare perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. Oreomyrrhis pulvinifica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
