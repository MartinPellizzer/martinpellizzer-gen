This plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral bracts that resemble small bells, giving it its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Orbeopsis valida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses for its unique appearance."
