    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. morisii, commonly known as the Moris's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
