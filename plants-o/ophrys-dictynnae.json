    "intro": "Ophrys dictynnae, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the rocky habitats of Greece. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a hairy, bee-like labellum that attracts male bees for pollination. It thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils, often growing on limestone or rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys dictynnae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
