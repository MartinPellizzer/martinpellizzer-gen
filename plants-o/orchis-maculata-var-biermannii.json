    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. biermannii, commonly known as the Biermann's spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive purple and white spotted flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows, preferring partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
