    "intro": "Onobrychis prolifica, commonly known as the common sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces fluffy, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis prolifica is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and historical use as forage for livestock."
