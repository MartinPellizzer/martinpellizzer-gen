    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. recurvifolia, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with dark spots, which are typically arranged in a loose spike. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often recurved, giving it its specific epithet \"recurvifolia.\" It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
