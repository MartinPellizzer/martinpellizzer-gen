    "intro": "Ononis cephalotes var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, and its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature. This variety is adapted to dry conditions and is commonly found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
