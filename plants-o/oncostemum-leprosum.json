    "intro": "Oncostemum leprosum, commonly known as the leprose oncostemum, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often giving it a delicate appearance. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
