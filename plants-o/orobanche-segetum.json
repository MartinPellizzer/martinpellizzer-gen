    "intro": "Orobanche segetum, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various agricultural fields across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is particularly problematic for farmers as it can significantly reduce crop yields by parasitizing plants like wheat and barley. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host plants, making it a challenging weed to control."
