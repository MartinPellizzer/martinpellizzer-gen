    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, appearing in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The species is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
