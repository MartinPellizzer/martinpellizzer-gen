    "intro": "Orchis morio f. subpicta, commonly known as the painted marsh orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the early purple orchid. It is characterized by its distinctive, often vividly colored petals and sepals, which can range from purple to pink and even white. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous habitats such as marshes and damp meadows. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and bloom in late spring to early summer. This orchid is a protected species in many regions due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
