    "intro": "Onobrychis velutina, commonly known as velvet brome, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense spikes, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Velvet brome is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor soils."
