It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
