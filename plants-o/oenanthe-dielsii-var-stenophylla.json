    "intro": "Oenanthe dielsii var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to moist environments, often found in stream banks or wet meadows. The species is noted for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
