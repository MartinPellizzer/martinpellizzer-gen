    "intro": "Oxalis leoncitensis, commonly known as the Lemon-scented Wood Sorrel, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves that have a tangy, lemon-like flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis leoncitensis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional cuisine."
