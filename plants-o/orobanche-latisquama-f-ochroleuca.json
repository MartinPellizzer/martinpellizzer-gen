    "intro": "Orobanche latisquama f. ochroleuca, commonly known as the pale yellow broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its stems are usually slender and branched. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in regulating host plant populations but can also be a concern in agricultural settings."
