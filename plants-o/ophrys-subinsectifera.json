    "intro": "Ophrys subinsectifera, commonly known as the lesser bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is notable for its specialized pollination strategy, which relies on the deceptive behavior of male bees."
