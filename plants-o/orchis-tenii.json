It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and a single, slender stem that bears a spike of flowers. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive purple or brownish lip, and they bloom from June to August. The plant is often found in woodlands, meadows, and grassy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Orchis tenii is a non-showy orchid that plays a role in local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated."
