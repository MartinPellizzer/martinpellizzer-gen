    "intro": "Ophrys aurita, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. Ophrys aurita is a perennial herb that produces showy blooms from late spring to early summer."
