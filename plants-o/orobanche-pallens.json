    "intro": "Orobanche pallens, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families. Due to its lack of roots and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
