    "intro": "Odontotrichum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense covering of short, stiff hairs that give it its common name. Odontotrichum pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a specialty plant in horticulture."
