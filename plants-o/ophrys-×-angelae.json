It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its intricate mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are highly specialized for pollination through sexual deception. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb structure and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies on plant-pollinator interactions."
