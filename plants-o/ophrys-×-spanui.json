It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, fuzzy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues. Ophrys \u00d7 spanui is a rare and protected species, reflecting its ecological significance and conservation status."
