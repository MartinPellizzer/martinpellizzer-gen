    "intro": "Osmia repanda, commonly known as the hairy leaf mining bee, is a solitary bee species belonging to the family Megachilidae. It is native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it inhabits a range of habitats including meadows, forests, and gardens. The plant associations of Osmia repanda are primarily with flowering plants, as it relies on them for nectar and pollen. Its larvae develop within leaf mines, typically in plants such as nettle and willow, where they feed on plant tissues. The plant's role in supporting this bee's life cycle highlights its ecological importance in pollination and biodiversity."
