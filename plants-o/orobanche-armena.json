    "intro": "Orobanche armena, commonly known as the Armenian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to reddish flowers, which are typically short-lived. It is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing on hosts such as legumes and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
