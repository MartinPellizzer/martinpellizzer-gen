    "intro": "Onosma bulbotricha var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered onion weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, often with a distinctive violet hue. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its more intensely colored flowers compared to the typical form of Onosma bulbotricha."
