    "intro": "Ophrys biceratia, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes two prominent, horn-like projections on the lip of the flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish in color, and they emit a scent that mimics the pheromones of female bees, aiding in pollination. Ophrys biceratia is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with several blooms along its length."
