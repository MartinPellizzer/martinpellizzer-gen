    "intro": "Oxandra proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's oxandra, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of western Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Cameroon. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxandra proctorii is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
