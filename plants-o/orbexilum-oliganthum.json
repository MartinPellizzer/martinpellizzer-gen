    "intro": "Orbexilum oliganthum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Orbexilum oliganthum is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
