    "intro": "Onoctonia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered nightshade, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Peru, where it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a rough texture, and the fruit is a small, fleshy berry containing several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Onoctonia pauciflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
