    "intro": "Oryza nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal rice or mountain rice, is a species of grass native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, mountainous environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its grains are small and have a distinct aroma, though it is not widely cultivated for food. Oryza nepalensis holds ecological significance as a potential source of genetic diversity for rice breeding programs."
