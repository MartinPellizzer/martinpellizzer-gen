    "intro": "Orobanche spruneri, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests."
