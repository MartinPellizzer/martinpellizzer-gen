    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii subsp. georgii-reuteri, commonly known as the Georgian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reduced stems. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers, often in clusters, and is typically found in dry, open habitats. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a hemiparasite."
