    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a strikingly bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette, while its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
