It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, growing in well-drained soils. Ornithogalum pallidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
