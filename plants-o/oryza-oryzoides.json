    "intro": "Oryza oryzoides, commonly known as the wild rice of the Americas, is a grass species native to South America. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and floodplains. The plant has slender, elongated leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective hull, which makes them difficult to process. Oryza oryzoides is considered an important forage plant and has potential agricultural value due to its adaptability to wet conditions."
