    "intro": "Orthochilus tabularis, commonly known as the flat-leaf orthochilus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its dry habitat. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in the spring. The plant's morphology reflects its evolutionary response to survive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce conditions."
