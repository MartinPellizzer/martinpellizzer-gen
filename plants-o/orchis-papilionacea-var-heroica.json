    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea var. heroica, commonly known as the Heroic Butterfly Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with intricate patterns resembling wings. This variant is native to specific alpine regions in Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and moths, which are attracted by its strong fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
