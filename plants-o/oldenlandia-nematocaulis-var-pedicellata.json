It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. Small white to pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, bead-like berries that are typically red when mature. It is often found in disturbed soils and is native to parts of Africa and Asia."
