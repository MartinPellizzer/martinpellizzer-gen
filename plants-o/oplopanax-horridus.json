    "intro": "Oplopanax horridus, commonly known as the devil's club, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, waxy, spiny leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Oplopanax horridus has cultural significance to Indigenous peoples and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
