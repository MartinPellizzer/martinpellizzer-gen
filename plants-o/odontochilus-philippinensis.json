    "intro": "Odontochilus philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique toothed lip, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte on trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
