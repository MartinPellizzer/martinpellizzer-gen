    "intro": "Oncidium cinnabarinum, commonly known as the cinnamon orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are long, strap-like, and slightly hairy, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Oncidium cinnabarinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
