    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 deserta, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in spring or early summer. Its fruit, called a tuna, is a large, segmented berry that ripens to a deep red or purple color. Opuntia \u00d7 deserta is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
