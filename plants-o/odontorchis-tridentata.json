    "intro": "Odontorchis tridentata, commonly known as the Tridentate Orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its leaf structure and flowering stems. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a distinctive tridentate (three-toothed) lip that gives it its scientific name. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
