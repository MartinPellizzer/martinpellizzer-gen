    "intro": "Oenanthe crocata var. oligactis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks and in damp meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early summer. The species is characterized by its aromatic, slightly toxic sap, which contains compounds like cicutoxin."
