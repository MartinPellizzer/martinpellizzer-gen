    "intro": "Oncidium williamsii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, slender stems with clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant has parallel-veined, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant blooms that typically last several weeks. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium williamsii is popular among orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
