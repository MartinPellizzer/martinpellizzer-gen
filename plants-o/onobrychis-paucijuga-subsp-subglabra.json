    "intro": "Onobrychis paucijuga subsp. subglabra, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by small, inflated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its low-growing habit and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
