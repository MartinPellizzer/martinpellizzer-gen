    "intro": "Ouratea candelabra, commonly known as the candlestick tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright, branching structure that resembles a candlestick, with multiple slender, ascending branches. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glossy surface. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds."
