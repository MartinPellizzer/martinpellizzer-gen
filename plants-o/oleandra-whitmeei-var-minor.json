It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
