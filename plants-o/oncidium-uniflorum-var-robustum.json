    "intro": "Oncidium uniflorum var. robustum, commonly known as the robust orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red-brown markings. The plant typically thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ease of care and long-lasting blooms. The varietal form 'robustum' is noted for its sturdy growth and enhanced flowering compared to the typical variety."
