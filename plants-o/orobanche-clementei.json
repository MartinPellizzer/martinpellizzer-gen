    "intro": "Orobanche clementei, commonly known as the Clement's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, including those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host species."
