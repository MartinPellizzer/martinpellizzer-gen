    "intro": "Oreogrammitis ilanensis, commonly known as the Ilanensis wall fern, is a rare and specialized epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps in moisture retention. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreogrammitis ilanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
