    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking combination of yellow and brown hues. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
