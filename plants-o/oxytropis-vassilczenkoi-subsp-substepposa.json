    "intro": "Oxytropis vassilczenkoi subsp. substepposa, commonly known as the steppe oxytropis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple to pink in color, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in steppes and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
