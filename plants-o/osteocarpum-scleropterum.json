    "intro": "Osteocarpum scleropterum, commonly known as the hard-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are hard, woody capsules that contain several seeds, adapted for dispersal by wind or through animal activity. Osteocarpum scleropterum is characterized by its succulent leaves and ability to survive in drought conditions."
