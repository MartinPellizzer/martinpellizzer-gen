    "intro": "Osmunda collina, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically upright and composed of multiple pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Osmunda collina is an important component of the understory vegetation in temperate forests."
