    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pingbienensis, commonly known as the Pingbien endemic shrub, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Vietnam and China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their diverse ecological roles. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
