    "intro": "Ornithocephalus vasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez's ornithocephalus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
