    "intro": "Ouratea oleifolia var. subvelutina, commonly known as the velvet ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are typically elliptical, with a leathery texture and a fine, velvety surface that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
