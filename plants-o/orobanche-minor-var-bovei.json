    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. bovei, commonly known as the small broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
