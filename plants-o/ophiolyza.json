    "intro": "Ophiolyza, commonly known as the false arrowhead, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Ophiolyza species are often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are generally not widely commercially grown."
