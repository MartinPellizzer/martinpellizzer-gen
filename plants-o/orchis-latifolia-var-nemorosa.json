    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. nemorosa, commonly known as the wood orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland areas of Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces tall, unbranched stems with showy, violet-blue flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and have a distinctive three-lobed lip. This orchid is adapted to moist, shaded environments and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a striking floral display to forest floors."
