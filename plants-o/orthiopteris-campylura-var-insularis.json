    "intro": "Orthiopteris campylura var. insularis, commonly known as the island cliff brake, is a variant of the cliff brake fern native to specific island habitats. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and coastal cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and ecological specificity, making it a rare and specialized species."
