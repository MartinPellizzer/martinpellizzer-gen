    "intro": "Ouratea vogelii, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a leathery texture and a glossy appearance. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and adaptability to various soil types, it is a popular choice for shade gardens and tropical landscapes."
