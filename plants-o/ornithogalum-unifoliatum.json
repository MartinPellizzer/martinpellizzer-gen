    "intro": "Ornithogalum unifoliatum, commonly known as the single-leaved star-of-Bethleem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a solitary, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
