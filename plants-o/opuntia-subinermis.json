    "intro": "Opuntia subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are adapted for water storage, making it well-suited for arid environments. Opuntia subinermis plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
