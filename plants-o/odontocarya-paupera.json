    "intro": "Odontocarya paupera, commonly known as the poor man's cypress, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypresses and junipers. The plant is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
