It features a short, underground rhizome and produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along coastal dunes and rocky shores. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
