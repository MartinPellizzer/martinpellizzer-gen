    "intro": "Ophelus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae. These plants are native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Ophelus species are typically small shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. They have a fibrous root system that helps them survive in poor soil conditions and withstand periods of drought. The genus is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
