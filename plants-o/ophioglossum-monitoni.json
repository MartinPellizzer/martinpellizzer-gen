    "intro": "Ophioglossum monitoni, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a single, upright, strap-like leaf that emerges from a rhizome, with a spore-bearing structure called a sporangium at the base. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are positioned on the underside of the leaf, a feature that distinguishes it from many other ferns. Ophioglossum monitoni is considered a living fossil due to its primitive structure and limited geographic distribution."
