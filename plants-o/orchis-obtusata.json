It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip. Orchis obtusata is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
