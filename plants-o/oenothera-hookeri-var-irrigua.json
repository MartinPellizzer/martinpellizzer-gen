    "intro": "Oenothera hookeri var. irrigua, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are typically 2\u20134 inches in diameter and bloom from late spring to early summer. The species is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
