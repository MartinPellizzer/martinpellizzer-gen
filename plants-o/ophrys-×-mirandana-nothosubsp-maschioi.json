    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 mirandana nothosubsp. maschioi, commonly known as the Maschio's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in Italy. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces showy, bee-like flowers that are pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the Ophrys genus."
