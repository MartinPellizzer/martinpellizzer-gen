    "intro": "Onosma glomerata, commonly known as clustered fleabane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and fields. The plant produces small, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Onosma glomerata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean and temperate regions."
