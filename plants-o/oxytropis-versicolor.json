    "intro": "Oxytropis versicolor, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a range of flower colors from white to purple, depending on the variety. Oxytropis versicolor is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria makes it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
