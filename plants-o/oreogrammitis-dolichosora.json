    "intro": "Oreogrammitis dolichosora, commonly known as the long-stalked rock fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with simple, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves, and it is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical or subtropical climates. This species is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
