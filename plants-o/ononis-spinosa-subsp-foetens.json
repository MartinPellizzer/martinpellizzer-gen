    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. foetens, commonly known as stinkcup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a wiry, branched stem with small, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, and it produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are often referred to as \"false strawberries.\" The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the fruits are mature."
