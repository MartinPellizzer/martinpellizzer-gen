    "intro": "Ornithocephalus reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white petals. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
