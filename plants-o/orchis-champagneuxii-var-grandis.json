It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically display a mix of purple, white, and yellow hues. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Its growth habit includes a tall, upright stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
