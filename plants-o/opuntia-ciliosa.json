    "intro": "Opuntia ciliosa, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. Opuntia ciliosa is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
