    "intro": "Ornithidium pseudonubigenum, commonly known as the cloud-like fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the appearance of clouds, hence its common name. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
