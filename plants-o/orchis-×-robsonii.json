    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 robsonii, commonly known as the Robson's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats across parts of Europe. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. Orchis \u00d7 robsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
