    "intro": "Ornithidium biolleyi, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and intricate, fragrant flower structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ornithidium biolleyi is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
