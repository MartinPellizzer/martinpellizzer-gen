    "intro": "Ozothamnus cordatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf golden bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a compact, bushy growth habit. Ozothamnus cordatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
