It is characterized by its distinctive, toothed leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Odontocarpha species are native to regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and taxonomic contexts."
