    "intro": "Ophrys astypalaeica, commonly known as the Astypalaia bee orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Astypalaia in the Greek Aegean. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys astypalaeica is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
