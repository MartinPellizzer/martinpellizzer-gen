    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza ophiorrhizoides, commonly known as the slender beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that thrives in sandy and saline environments, often found along shorelines and tidal zones. The plant has opposite, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal along coastal areas. Ophiorrhiza ophiorrhizoides is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic inundation, making it an important component of coastal flora."
