    "intro": "Oedera uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale green, and it blooms during the summer months. Oedera uniflora is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the nutrients obtained from captured prey."
