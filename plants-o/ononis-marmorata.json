    "intro": "Ononis marmorata, commonly known as the marbleweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. Ononis marmorata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
