    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. masticorum, commonly known as the Mastic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex, lip-like structure that mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, sunny habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
