    "intro": "Oxalis nemoralis, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or yellow markings, resembling a cloverleaf. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or violet, typically blooming in spring. Oxalis nemoralis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though the oxalic acid content should be considered before consumption."
