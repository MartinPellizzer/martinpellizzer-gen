    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and is native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in areas with limited vegetation. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
