    "intro": "Onobrychis wiedemannii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Onobrychis wiedemannii is valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
