    "intro": "Orobanche aeginetia, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure with a short, swollen stem and a cluster of small, scale-like leaves. It typically parasitizes leguminous plants such as vetch and clover, weakening them by drawing water and nutrients. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays an important role in certain ecosystems as a specialist parasite."
