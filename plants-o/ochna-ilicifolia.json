It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy, bluish-green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are encased in a fleshy, red or orange aril. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
