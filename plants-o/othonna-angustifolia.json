It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Othonna angustifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
