    "intro": "Ophrys speculum subsp. regis-ferdinandii, commonly known as the royal fern orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy orchid flower with intricate patterns and a distinct scent that attracts male bees for mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
