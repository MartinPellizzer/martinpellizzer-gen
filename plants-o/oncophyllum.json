    "intro": "Oncophyllum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, with some extending into parts of Asia and Australia. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lanceolate or ovate in shape, and they produce yellow to orange composite flowers. Oncophyllum species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may behave as annuals depending on the climate."
