    "intro": "Odontosoria chinensis f. kenzoana, commonly known as the Kenzoan tooth fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
