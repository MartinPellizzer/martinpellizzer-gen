    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subvar. aurita, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a prominent, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that enhances its mimicry of a female bee. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
