    "intro": "Onobrychis tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and erect, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by distinctive, hairy, pod-like fruits. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
