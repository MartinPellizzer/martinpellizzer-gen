    "intro": "Ononis tridentata subsp. tridentata, commonly known as three-toothed cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
