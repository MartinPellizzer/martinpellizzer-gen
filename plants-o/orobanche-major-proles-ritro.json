    "intro": "Orobanche major proles ritro, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that are adapted for pollination by insects. It typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, and is found in various habitats across Europe and Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
