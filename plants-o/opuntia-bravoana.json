    "intro": "Opuntia bravoana, commonly known as the Bravo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. Opuntia bravoana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to extreme temperatures and low rainfall. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert ecosystems and xerophytic habitats."
