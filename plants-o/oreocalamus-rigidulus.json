    "intro": "Oreocalamus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid reed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright culms and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers."
