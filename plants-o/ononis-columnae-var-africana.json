It is characterized by its upright, often branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open grasslands and along coastal areas, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
