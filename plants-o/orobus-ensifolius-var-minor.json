    "intro": "Orobus ensifolius var. minor, commonly known as the lesser swordleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
