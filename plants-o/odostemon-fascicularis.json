    "intro": "Odostemon fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a fibrous root system that is highly valued for its starchy, edible tubers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often with white or pale yellow petals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and ornamental appeal."
