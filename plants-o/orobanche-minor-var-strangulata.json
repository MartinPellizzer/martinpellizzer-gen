    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. strangulata, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in association with various grasses and legumes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
