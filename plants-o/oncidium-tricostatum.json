    "intro": "Oncidium tricostatum, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often-dry habitat. Its leaves are typically long and strap-like, providing support for the inflorescence. Oncidium tricostatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
