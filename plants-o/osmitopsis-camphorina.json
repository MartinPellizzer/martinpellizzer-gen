    "intro": "Osmitopsis camphorina, commonly known as the camphor bush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves that emit a strong camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant has small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, corky layer that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Osmitopsis camphorina is also valued for its medicinal properties, with various traditional uses in local communities."
