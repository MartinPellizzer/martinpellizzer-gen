    "intro": "Orobanche villiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish or greenish flowers, which are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed soils or on the roots of other plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
