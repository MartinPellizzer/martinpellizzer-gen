    "intro": "Ophioglossum polyphyllum var. polyphyllum, commonly known as the giant climbing fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, with each leaflet being elongated and narrow. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of its fertile fronds, which are typically found on the lower portion of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in association with decaying organic matter. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
