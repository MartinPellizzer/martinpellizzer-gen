It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part. The plant features a short, leafy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is valued for its starchy tubers and has been used in various cultural and medicinal practices across its native range."
