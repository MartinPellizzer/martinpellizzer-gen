    "intro": "Orchis elata f. klingeana, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and have a unique structure with a spurred lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
