    "intro": "Olfa thalictrifolia, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of shiny, heart-shaped leaves that emerge early in the spring. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming from March to May. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora."
