    "intro": "Ophrys beloniae, commonly known as the Belonia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ophrys genus, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that are primarily pollinated by bees, particularly the Andrena species. Its flowers have a distinctive coloration and pattern that closely resembles the appearance of a female bee. Ophrys beloniae is a protected species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
