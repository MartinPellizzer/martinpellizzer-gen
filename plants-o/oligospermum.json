    "intro": "Oligospermum, commonly known as the \"narrow-leaved spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. The flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, which are cup-like structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Oligospermum species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
