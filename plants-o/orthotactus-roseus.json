    "intro": "Orthotactus roseus, commonly known as the pink rock orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features a short rhizome with a single erect stem bearing a few lanceolate leaves. Its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
