    "intro": "Oplonia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which appear in late winter to early spring. Oplonia acuminata is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
