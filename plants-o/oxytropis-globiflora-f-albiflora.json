    "intro": "Oxytropis globiflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive, inflated pod that matures into a dry, dehiscent fruit. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
