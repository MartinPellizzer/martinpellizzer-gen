    "intro": "Onopordum cinereum, commonly known as the gray thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, woolly leaves that are typically lobed or serrated, and it produces purple or pinkish composite flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Onopordum cinereum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
