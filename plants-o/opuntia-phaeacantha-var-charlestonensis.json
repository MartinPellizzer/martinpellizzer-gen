    "intro": "Opuntia phaeacantha var. charlestonensis, commonly known as the Charleston cholla, is a succulent cactus native to the southeastern United States. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a grayish bloom, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its small, spiny cladodes help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
