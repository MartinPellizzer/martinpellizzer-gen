    "intro": "Onobrychis lasiostachya f. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval, serrated leaflets. It is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is less common than the typical form and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability."
