    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. garganica, commonly known as the Garganica orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or scrublands. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
