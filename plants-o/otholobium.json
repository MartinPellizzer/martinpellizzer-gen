    "intro": "Otholobium, commonly known as the needlepod or needlepod bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their small, needle-like pods and often hairy foliage. Otholobium species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as forage for livestock."
