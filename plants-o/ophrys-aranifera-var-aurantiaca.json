    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow and orange coloration that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, with a specialized labellum that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
