    "intro": "Oxytropis nana var. salmonensis, commonly known as the salmon mountain milkvetch, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is typically fibrous and adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
