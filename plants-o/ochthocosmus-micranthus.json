    "intro": "Ochthocosmus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered ochthocosmus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypselae. Ochthocosmus micranthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
