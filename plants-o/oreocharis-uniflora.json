    "intro": "Oreocharis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower oreocharis, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to China. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a single, showy flower with a distinctive white or pale yellow coloration. Its leaves are usually linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
