    "intro": "Opercularia varia var. scabrida, commonly known as the rough opercularia, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a dense, leathery layer on its substrate. The lobes of the thallus are often irregular and may have a rough, scaly texture, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil in temperate regions. The lichen is known for its chemical composition, which includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and resistance to environmental stress."
