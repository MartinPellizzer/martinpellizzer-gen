    "intro": "Ophioglossum moultonii, commonly known as the Moulton's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with separate male and female organs located on the same plant. Ophioglossum moultonii is considered a relict species, reflecting its evolutionary history from the Carboniferous period."
