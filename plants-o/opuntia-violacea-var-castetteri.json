    "intro": "Opuntia violacea var. castetteri, commonly known as the Castetter's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its pads are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, succulent flavor when ripe."
