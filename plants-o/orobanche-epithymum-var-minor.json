    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas where it parasitizes crops like wheat and barley. Its small, inconspicuous leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in cultivated plants."
