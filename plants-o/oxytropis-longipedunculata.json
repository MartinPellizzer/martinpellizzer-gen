    "intro": "Oxytropis longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oxytropis longipedunculata plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitat."
