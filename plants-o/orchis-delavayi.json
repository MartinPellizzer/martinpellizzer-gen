    "intro": "Orchis delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate flowers with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip. Orchis delavayi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
