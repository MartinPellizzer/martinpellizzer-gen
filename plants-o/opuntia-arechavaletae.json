    "intro": "Opuntia arechavaletae, commonly known as the Arechavaleta prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Its adaptations to harsh environments include reduced leaves and thick, water-storing stems. Opuntia arechavaletae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
