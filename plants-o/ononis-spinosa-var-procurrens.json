It features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and hairy, often with a bluish-green hue. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry meadows, gravelly slopes, and along coastal areas."
