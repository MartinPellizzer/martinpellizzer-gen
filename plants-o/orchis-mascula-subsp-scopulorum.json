    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the rough-petaled orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant features a stout, leafless stem that bears a single, showy orchid-like flower with a distinctive, hairy lip. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a strong, spicy scent that attracts insect pollinators. The subspecies is characterized by its rough, textured petals and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
