    "intro": "Oberonia insularis, commonly known as the island Oberonia, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland forests. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with a single, fleshy leaf and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is closely related to other members of the Oberonia genus, which are known for their unique floral structures. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia insularis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
