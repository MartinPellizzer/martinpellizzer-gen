    "intro": "Oxytropis staintoniana, commonly known as Stainton's locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in Idaho and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear small, yellowish-pink flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Oxytropis staintoniana is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which helps improve soil fertility in its native environment."
