    "intro": "Osmunda angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it can receive adequate moisture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda angustifolia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
