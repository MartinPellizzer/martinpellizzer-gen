    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 rolfei, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates with seasonal dry periods. Oncidium \u00d7 rolfei is popular in horticulture for its showy blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
