    "intro": "Opuntia diffusa, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains numerous seeds. Opuntia diffusa is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient and long-lived plant."
