    "intro": "Onobrychis pulchella f. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the silky bupleurum, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves that are pinnately divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it a distinctive and ornamental species in botanical gardens."
