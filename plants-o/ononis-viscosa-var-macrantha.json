    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. macrantha, commonly known as the broad-flowered sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands."
