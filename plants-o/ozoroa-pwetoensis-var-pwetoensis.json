    "intro": "Ozoroa pwetoensis var. pwetoensis, commonly known as the Pweto ozoroa, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and are accompanied by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for local wildlife. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution in its native habitat."
