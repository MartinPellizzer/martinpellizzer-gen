    "intro": "Oxycoccus ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved oxycoccus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often in boreal or subarctic regions. The plant features dense, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. Oxycoccus ovalifolius plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing food and shelter for wildlife."
