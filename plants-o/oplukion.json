    "intro": "Oplukion, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, evergreen foliage with glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Oplukion thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
