    "intro": "Oxalis albiuscula, commonly known as the whiteleaf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with a pale green color and small, delicate white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage resembles that of other oxalis species, but it is distinguished by its notably pale leaves. Oxalis albiuscula is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
