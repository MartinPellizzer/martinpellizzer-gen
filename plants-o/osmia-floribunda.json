It is characterized by its small size, typically measuring around 10\u201315 millimeters in length, and its distinctive black and yellow striped body. The plant it pollinates, often a variety of flowering plants, benefits from its efficient pollination habits. Osmia floribunda constructs its nests in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or bee hotels, where it lays its eggs. This species plays a vital role in the ecological balance by contributing to the pollination of various flora."
