It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along its stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Odyssea jaegeri is considered a vulnerable species."
