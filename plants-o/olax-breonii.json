    "intro": "Olax breonii, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Olax breonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
