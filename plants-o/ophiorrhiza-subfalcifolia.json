    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza subfalcifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical or ovate leaves that are usually glabrous. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny seeds. This species is adapted to saline and waterlogged soils, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems."
