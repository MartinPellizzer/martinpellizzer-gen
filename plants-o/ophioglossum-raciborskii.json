    "intro": "Ophioglossum raciborskii, commonly known as the horse tail fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a terminal tuft resembling a horse's tail. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually long and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Ophioglossum raciborskii is considered a primitive vascular plant, showcasing features that are similar to those of ancient plant species."
