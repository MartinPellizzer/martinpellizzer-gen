    "intro": "Ozoroa reticulata var. cinerea, commonly known as the gray sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming from spring to summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions. The species is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a characteristic plant of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem."
