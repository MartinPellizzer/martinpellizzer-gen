It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are glossy and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange when mature.
