    "intro": "Orchis amblyoloba, commonly known as the narrow-lobed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil. Orchis amblyoloba thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
