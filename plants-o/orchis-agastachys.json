    "intro": "Orchis agastachys, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of many orchids, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in elongated pods. Orchis agastachys is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
