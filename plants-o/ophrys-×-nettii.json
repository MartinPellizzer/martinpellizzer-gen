    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 nettii, commonly known as the nettle orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait used to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 nettii is a perennial herb with a short rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a few showy flowers."
