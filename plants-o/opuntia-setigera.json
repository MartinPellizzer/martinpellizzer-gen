    "intro": "Opuntia setigera, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia setigera is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
