    "intro": "Ononis hircina var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular whitlowgrass, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered with glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance and a slightly sticky texture. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
