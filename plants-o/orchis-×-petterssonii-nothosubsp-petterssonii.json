    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 petterssonii nothosubsp. petterssonii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis \u00d7 petterssonii. It is characterized by its tall, erect flowering stems that bear a single, showy orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its floral structure includes a lip that is often more elongated than in its parent species. The plant is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic composition and ornamental value."
