    "intro": "Ostericum sieboldii var. praeteritum, commonly known as the Japanese mountain fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological niche within its native habitat."
