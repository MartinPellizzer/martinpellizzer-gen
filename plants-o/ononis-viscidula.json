    "intro": "Ononis viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stoloniferous stems that help it spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow, often covered in a sticky substance that aids in water retention. Ononis viscidula is well adapted to arid conditions, making it a hardy species for rocky or sandy landscapes."
