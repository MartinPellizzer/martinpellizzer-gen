    "intro": "Oreoselis divaricata, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, branching stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of various host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
