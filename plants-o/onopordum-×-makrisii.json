    "intro": "Onopordum \u00d7 makrisii, commonly known as the hybrid globe thistle, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid between Onopordum acanthium and Onopordum helenium, resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its spherical, spiky flower heads that resemble a globe, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of gray-green, hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Onopordum \u00d7 makrisii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun."
