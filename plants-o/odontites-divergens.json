    "intro": "Odontites divergens, commonly known as the forked rock fern, is a small, perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has a creeping rhizome with erect, slender fronds that are usually divided into two or more lobes. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive forked appearance that gives it its common name. Odontites divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
