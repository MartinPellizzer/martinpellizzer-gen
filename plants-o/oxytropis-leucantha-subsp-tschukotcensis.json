    "intro": "Oxytropis leucantha subsp. tschukotcensis, commonly known as the Tschukotka locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Russia and Alaska. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
