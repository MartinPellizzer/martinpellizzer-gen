    "intro": "Olfersia subdiaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks true leaves. Its delicate appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of both botanical fascination and conservation concern. Due to habitat destruction, Olfersia subdiaphana is considered endangered in many regions."
