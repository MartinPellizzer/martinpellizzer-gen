    "intro": "Ophrys antalyensis, commonly known as the Antalya bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in mountainous regions, preferring sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its deceptive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ophrys antalyensis is considered a vulnerable species."
