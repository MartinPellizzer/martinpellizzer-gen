It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling bells, hence its common name. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped, adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its native habitat. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, which includes many other bell-shaped flowers. Oxydectes orbignyana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
