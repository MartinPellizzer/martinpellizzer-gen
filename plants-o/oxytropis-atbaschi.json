It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, typical of many leguminous species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Oxytropis atbaschi is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
