    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 erythrantha, commonly known as the red-lipped orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a tall, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant features showy, spurred orchid flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive red lip. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing nutrients from the soil in woodland habitats. Orchis \u00d7 erythrantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in damp, shaded areas."
