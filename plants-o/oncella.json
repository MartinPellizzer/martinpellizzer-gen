    "intro": "Oncella, commonly known as the sea hare, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and the presence of a muscular foot used for crawling along the ocean floor. Oncella species are often found in shallow coastal waters and are known for their ability to secrete a viscous mucus to protect themselves from predators. They also exhibit a variety of colors, which can serve as a form of camouflage or warning to potential threats. These organisms play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as prey for larger marine animals."
