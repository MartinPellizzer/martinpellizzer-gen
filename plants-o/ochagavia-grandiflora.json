    "intro": "Ochagavia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered ochagavia, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to South America. This evergreen perennial is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly coating. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear clusters of bright red or orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ochagavia grandiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor or greenhouse settings."
