    "intro": "Onopordum maximum, commonly known as Great Coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust root system and upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and a yellow center, blooming from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Onopordum maximum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
