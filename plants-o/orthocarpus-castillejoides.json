    "intro": "Orthocarpus castillejoides, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Orthocarpus castillejoides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates."
