    "intro": "Orchis ecalcarata, commonly known as the spurred orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often in areas with rich, loamy soil. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing numerous showy, violet-blue flowers. Its most distinctive characteristic is the presence of a spur at the base of each petal, which is a unique botanical feature in the Orchidaceae family. The flowers bloom from May to July, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
