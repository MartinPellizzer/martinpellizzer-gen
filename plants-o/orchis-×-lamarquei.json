It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are often arranged in a raceme and feature a distinctive lip that is highly specialized for pollination. Orchis \u00d7 lamarquei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
