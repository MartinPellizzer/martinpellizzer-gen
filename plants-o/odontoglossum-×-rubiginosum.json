    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, red-tinged floral bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are usually white or pale pink with a distinctive red or purple lip. Odontoglossum \u00d7 rubiginosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
