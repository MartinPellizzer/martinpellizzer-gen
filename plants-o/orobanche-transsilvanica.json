    "intro": "Orobanche transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily in Europe, particularly in forested areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced morphology compared to its host. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Betula, such as birch trees. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a parasite with limited ecological impact."
