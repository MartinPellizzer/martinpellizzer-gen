It features slender stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a basal rosette, and are covered with a fine pubescence. Ononis mollis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
