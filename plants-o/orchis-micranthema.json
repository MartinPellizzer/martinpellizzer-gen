    "intro": "Orchis micranthema, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces upright flowering stems with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its flowers lack a distinct lip, and the plant is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Orchis micranthema is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates."
