    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. seemenii, commonly known as the Seemann's pink orchid, is a rare and beautiful orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and a slender, erect stem that supports its showy inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
