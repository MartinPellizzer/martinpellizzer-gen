    "intro": "Oenothera pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Oenothera pinnatifida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
