    "intro": "Orobanche californica subsp. californica, commonly known as the California broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the western United States, particularly California. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and forbs, forming a symbiotic relationship with its hosts. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
