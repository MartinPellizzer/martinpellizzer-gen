    "intro": "Oxytropis fetida proles viscosa, commonly known as stinkpea, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Oxytropis fetida proles viscosa is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is damaged or crushed."
