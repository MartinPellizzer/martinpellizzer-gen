    "intro": "Orchiodes repens, commonly known as the creeping orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its delicate nature, it is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat."
