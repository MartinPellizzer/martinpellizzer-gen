    "intro": "Ophioglossum lusitanicum subsp. coriaceum, commonly known as the Portuguese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, spurred spores and a single, broad, leathery leaf that resembles a tongue. The plant produces a short, erect spore-bearing stem with a distinctive, hooded structure at the base. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
