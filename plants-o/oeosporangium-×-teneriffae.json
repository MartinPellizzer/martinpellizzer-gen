    "intro": "Oeosporangium \u00d7 teneriffae, commonly known as the Canary Island fern, is a hybrid species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces sporangia in clusters, which are specialized structures for spore production. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
