    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. campestris, commonly known as field sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its creeping stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
