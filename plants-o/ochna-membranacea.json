    "intro": "Ochna membranacea, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. Ochna membranacea is typically found in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
