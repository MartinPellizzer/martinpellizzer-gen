    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. flexospina, commonly known as the flexible spine prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered with spines, which are shorter and more flexible compared to other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to desert conditions and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
