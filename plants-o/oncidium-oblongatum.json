    "intro": "Oncidium oblongatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow and green. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Oncidium oblongatum is known for its ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
