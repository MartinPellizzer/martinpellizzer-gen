    "intro": "Ophiobotrys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its delicate, white, fragrant flowers that bloom on a single, slender stem. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a unique root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ophiobotrys is considered endangered and is often found in moist, shaded environments like cypress swamps."
