    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 salteri, commonly known as the Salter's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rhizomatous root system, typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing spike-like inflorescences with showy, violet to purple flowers that have a distinctive, spurred lip. Its botanical features reflect a blend of its parent species, showcasing morphological variability. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often considered a relict population with limited distribution in specific regions of Europe."
