    "intro": "Opuntia catocantha, commonly known as the Catocanha prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia catocantha is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
