    "intro": "Opuntia macrocentra var. aureispina, commonly known as the golden spine prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of bright yellow spines, which are shorter and less dense than those of other Opuntia species. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The golden spine variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
