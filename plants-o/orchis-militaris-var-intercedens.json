    "intro": "Orchis militaris var. intercedens, commonly known as the military orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its morphology includes a short stem with a single, erect flower spike. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
