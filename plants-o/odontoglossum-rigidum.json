    "intro": "Odontoglossum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Odontoglossum rigidum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
