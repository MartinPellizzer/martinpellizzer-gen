    "intro": "Ophioglossum reticulatum var. polyangium, commonly known as the reticulate adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its unique, spurred spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces large, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
