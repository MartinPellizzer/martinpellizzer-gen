    "intro": "Opuntia lindheimeri subsp. cantabrigiensis, commonly known as the Cambridge prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spiny glochids and short, stiff spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, making it well adapted to arid environments. The fruit, which develops after flowering, is edible and often used in local cuisines."
