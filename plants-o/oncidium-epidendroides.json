    "intro": "Oncidium epidendroides, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a crown. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium epidendroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
