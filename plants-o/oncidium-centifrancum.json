    "intro": "Oncidium centifrancum, commonly known as the Fringed Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender pseudobulbs and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive fringed petals. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to prevent root rot. Oncidium centifrancum is often grown as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
