    "intro": "Onobrychis aurea, commonly known as golden burr medic, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis aurea is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
