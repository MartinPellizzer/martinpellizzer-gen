    "intro": "Ononis marocana, commonly known as Moroccan sandflower, is a perennial herb native to North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ononis marocana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
