    "intro": "Oxytropis echidna, commonly known as the echidna milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, dry pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis echidna is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
