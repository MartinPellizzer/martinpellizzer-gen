    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. lutea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the ground. The orchid produces a single raceme of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
