    "intro": "Oncidium guianense, commonly known as the Guianan orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Oncidium guianense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
