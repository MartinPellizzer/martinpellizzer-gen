    "intro": "Oreophila tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender leaf mountain plant, is a herbaceous species native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to cool and moist environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Oreophila tenuifolia thrives in rocky soils and is often found in forested mountain areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
