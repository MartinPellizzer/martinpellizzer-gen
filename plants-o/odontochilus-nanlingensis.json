    "intro": "Odontochilus nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically features dark green,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
