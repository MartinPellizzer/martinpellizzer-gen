    "intro": "Onobrychis longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled burr medic, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis longipes is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and forage production."
