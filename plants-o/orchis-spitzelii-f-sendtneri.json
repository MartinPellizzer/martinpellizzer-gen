    "intro": "Orchis spitzelii f. sendtneri, commonly known as the Sendtner's early orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a compact growth habit, featuring a short, stocky rhizome and a single, erect stem. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet-blue coloration, often with a yellowish-green lip. It blooms in early spring, typically between March and May, and is adapted to calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
