    "intro": "Oxytropis leptophysa, commonly known as the slenderleaf locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
