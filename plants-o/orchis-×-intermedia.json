    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant produces tall flowering stems with showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of resupinate flowers, each with a pouch-like labellum that aids in pollination. Orchis \u00d7 intermedia is often found in the UK and parts of Europe, where it plays a role in supporting pollinator populations."
