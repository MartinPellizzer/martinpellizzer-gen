    "intro": "Orbea gerstneri subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several feet in length, often with a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small and spine-tipped, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
