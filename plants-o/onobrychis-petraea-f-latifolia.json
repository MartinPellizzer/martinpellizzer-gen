    "intro": "Onobrychis petraea f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock brome, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are broader than the typical form of the species. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in spikelets, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid environments."
