    "intro": "Oreopanax venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan oreopanax, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. Its growth habit involves twining stems that allow it to ascend trees, making it a common sight in the understory of humid forests. Oreopanax venezuelensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
