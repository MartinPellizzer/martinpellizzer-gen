    "intro": "Oxytropis pyrenaica subsp. generosa, commonly known as the Pyrenean locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, rounded leaflets. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, it thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
