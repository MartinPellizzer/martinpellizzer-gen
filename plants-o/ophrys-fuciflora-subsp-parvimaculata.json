    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ophrys fuciflora subsp. parvimaculula, commonly known as the small-spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are small, with a distinctive dark brown to black pattern on the lip, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
