    "intro": "Ochnella rhizomatosa, commonly known as the root-stemmed ochna, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, woody fruits. Ochnella rhizomatosa is adapted to dry and disturbed environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
