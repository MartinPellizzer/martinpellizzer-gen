    "intro": "Opuntia obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically broad and oval in shape. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia obovata is well-known for its ability to store water and thrive in hot, dry climates."
