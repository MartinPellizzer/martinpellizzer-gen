    "intro": "Odostima orbiculata, commonly known as the roundleaf sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically orbicular or nearly circular in shape, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Odostima orbiculata is valued for its resilience to drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping and traditional medicine."
