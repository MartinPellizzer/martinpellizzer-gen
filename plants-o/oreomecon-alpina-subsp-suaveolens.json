    "intro": "Oreomecon alpina subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as the Alpine oreomecon, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This subspecies is adapted to harsh mountain climates and is often found in meadows and scree slopes."
