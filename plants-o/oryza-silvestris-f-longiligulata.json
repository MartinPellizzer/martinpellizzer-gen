    "intro": "Oryza silvestris f. longiligulata, commonly known as the long-ligule wild rice, is a variant of the wild rice species native to Asia. It is characterized by its elongated ligules, which are the hair-like structures at the base of its leaves. This plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, spikelet-like flowers that produce rice grains. The plant is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to aquatic environments."
