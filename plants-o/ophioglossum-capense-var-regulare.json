    "intro": "Ophioglossum capense var. regulare, commonly known as the African adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, tongue-like spore-bearing leaf called a sporophyll, which is typically dark green and has a distinctive, hooded shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the sporophyll, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an important indicator of undisturbed ecosystems."
