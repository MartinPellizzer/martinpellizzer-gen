    "intro": "Ononis rotundifolia f. cuneata, commonly known as the cuneate horseshoe vetch, is a variant of the horseshoe vetch species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, rounded or heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and well-developed, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal areas."
