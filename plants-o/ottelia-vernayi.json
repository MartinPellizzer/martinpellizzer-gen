    "intro": "Ottelia vernayi, commonly known as the African water starwort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are borne in clusters at the water's surface. Ottelia vernayi is valued for its ability to stabilize water ecosystems and provide habitat for aquatic life."
