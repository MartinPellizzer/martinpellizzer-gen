    "intro": "Oligoneurum bombycinum, commonly known as the yellow star moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a prostrate growth habit with tightly packed, greenish-yellow rhizoids that anchor it to the substrate. The plant produces small, rounded structures called gemmae, which are used for vegetative reproduction. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Oligoneurum bombycinum is often found in forest floors and rocky crevices, contributing to soil stabilization and moisture retention."
