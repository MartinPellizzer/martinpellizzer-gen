    "intro": "Oncinotis, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the western United States and are characterized by their showy, yellow to orange flower heads. Oncinotis species typically grow in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to arid environments. They have hairy, often grayish foliage that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually arranged in compact clusters and bloom in the spring or early summer."
