    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza neglecta f. sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran mangrove fern, is a variant of the mangrove fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in brackish water. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, including mangrove forests, where it thrives in saline and tidal conditions. Its rhizomes form dense networks that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting marine and coastal biodiversity."
