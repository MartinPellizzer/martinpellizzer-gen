    "intro": "Obregonia denegrii, commonly known as the desert hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, globular shape and its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant features areoles, which are small, raised structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and bloom in late spring or early summer. Obregonia denegrii is a slow-growing, drought-tolerant plant well adapted to harsh desert environments."
