    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza wattii var. talevalliensis, commonly known as the Talevalli's mangrove, is a rare and endemic species found in specific coastal regions of India. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in saline and brackish water environments, showcasing adaptations to such harsh conditions. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat destruction, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
