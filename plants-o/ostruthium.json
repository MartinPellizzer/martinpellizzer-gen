    "intro": "Ostruthium, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads and silver-blue foliage, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in salty, well-drained soils. Ostruthium species are often used in ornamental gardening for their visual appeal and hardiness. They are also valued for their ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
