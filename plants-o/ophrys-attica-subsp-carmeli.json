    "intro": "Ophrys attica subsp. carmeli, commonly known as the Carmel orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with a distinctively shaped column and spurs. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
