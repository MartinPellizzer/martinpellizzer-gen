    "intro": "Osmoxylon humile, commonly known as the dwarf osmoxylon, is a small shrub native to the southern United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of small, greenish flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in scrub habitats. Osmoxylon humile is relatively low maintenance and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
