    "intro": "Osbeckia cinerea, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs covering its leaves and stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Osbeckia cinerea is often found in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges."
