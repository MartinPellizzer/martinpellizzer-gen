    "intro": "Oenanthe prolifera, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically arranged in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Oenanthe prolifera is often found in streams, ditches, and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters."
