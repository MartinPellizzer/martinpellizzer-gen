    "intro": "Osmites angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf osmunda, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmites angustifolia plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
