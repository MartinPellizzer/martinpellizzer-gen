    "intro": "Oreopanax fulvus, commonly known as the yellow-veined arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with prominent yellow veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically enclosed within a spathe, a common feature in the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some regions."
