    "intro": "Orobanche robusta, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators, despite its parasitic nature. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the roots of host plants to extract water and nutrients. Due to its lack of leaves and photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialist parasite."
