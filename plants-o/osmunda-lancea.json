    "intro": "Osmunda lancea, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its rhizomes are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to form dense colonies. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to woodland gardens."
