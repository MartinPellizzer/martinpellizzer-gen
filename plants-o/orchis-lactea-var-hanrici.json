    "intro": "Orchis lactea var. hanrici, commonly known as the Hanrici's milk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are often tinged with green or brown, and its lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single flower spike, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
