    "intro": "Orobus alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Orobus alpestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
