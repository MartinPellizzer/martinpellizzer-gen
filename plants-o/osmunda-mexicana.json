    "intro": "Osmunda mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its floating fronds that are divided into small, delicate pinnae, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Osmunda mexicana plays a role in water filtration and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
