    "intro": "Ornithogalum aucheri, commonly known as the silver leaf lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
