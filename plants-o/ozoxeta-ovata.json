    "intro": "Ozoxeta ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaved ozoxylum, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Anacardiaceae. It is characterized by its ovate, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, often appearing in the axils of the leaves. Ozoxeta ovata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of understory vegetation."
