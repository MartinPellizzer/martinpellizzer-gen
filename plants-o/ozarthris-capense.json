    "intro": "Ozarthris capense, commonly known as the Cape thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Ozarthris capense is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
