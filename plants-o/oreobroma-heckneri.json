It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. The showy, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
