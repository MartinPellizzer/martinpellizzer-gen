    "intro": "Orthosia itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia orthosia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
