    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. bracteosa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common spotted orchid. It is a herbaceous perennial with striking purple and white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are arranged in a loose spike. This form is characterized by the presence of bracts, which are modified leaves that resemble small flowers, adding to its unique botanical appearance."
