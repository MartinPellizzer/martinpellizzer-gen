    "intro": "Odontoglossum vexillarium, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in high-altitude, cool climates. Its leaves are typically dark green and lance-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating. Odontoglossum vexillarium is a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
