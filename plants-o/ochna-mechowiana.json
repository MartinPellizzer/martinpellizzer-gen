It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, fleshy aril. Ochna mechowiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
