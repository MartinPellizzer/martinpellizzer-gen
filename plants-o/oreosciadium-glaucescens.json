    "intro": "Oreosciadium glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, vibrant blue-green foliage and its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the high altitudes of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Oreosciadium glaucescens is considered a rare and endangered species."
