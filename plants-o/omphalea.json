    "intro": "Omphalea, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"wild cucumber,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly tropical and subtropical regions, and are characterized by their distinctive, elongated fruits that resemble a sickle. The leaves are typically alternate, palmately lobed, and often have a hairy texture. Omphalea species produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and they are often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are considered invasive in certain areas."
