    "intro": "Ornithidium quitense, commonly known as the Andean feather orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble feathers, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithidium quitense is considered a vulnerable species."
