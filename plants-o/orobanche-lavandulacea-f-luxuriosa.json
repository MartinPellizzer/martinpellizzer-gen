    "intro": "Orobanche lavandulacea f. luxuriosa, commonly known as the purple broomweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to members of the legume family. The plant is characterized by its dense, branched stems and clusters of small, purple or violet flowers. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a nuisance in agricultural settings but also serves as a host for certain insects and fungi."
