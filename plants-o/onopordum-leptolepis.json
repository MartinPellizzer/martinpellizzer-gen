The plant produces large, showy purple to pink composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with rough, hairy surfaces and spiny margins. Onopordum leptolepis is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas."
