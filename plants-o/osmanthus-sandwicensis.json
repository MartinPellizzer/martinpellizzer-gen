    "intro": "Osmanthus sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian osmanthus, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
