It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and feathery, white-tipped inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Oryzopsis leucosperma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in its native range."
