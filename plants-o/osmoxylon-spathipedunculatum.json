    "intro": "Osmoxylon spathipedunculatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved osmoxylon, is a rare and little-known member of the Osmoxylon genus. It is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
