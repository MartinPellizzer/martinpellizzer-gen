It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland and swampy areas. Oxalis peduncularis is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
