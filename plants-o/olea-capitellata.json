    "intro": "Olea capitellata, commonly known as the Cape jasmine, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in spring. These flowers are followed by small, round, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Olea capitellata is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates."
