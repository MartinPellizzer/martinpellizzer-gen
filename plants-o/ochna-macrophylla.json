    "intro": "Ochna macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved ochna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Ochna macrophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
