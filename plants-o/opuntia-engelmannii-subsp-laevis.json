    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii subsp. laevis, commonly known as the Englemann's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
