    "intro": "Oreophilus dactylus, commonly known as the mountain dactyl, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreophilus dactylus thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of high-altitude flora and ecological adaptation."
