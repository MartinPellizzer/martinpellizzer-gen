It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations."
