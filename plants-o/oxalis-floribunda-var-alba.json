    "intro": "Oxalis floribunda var. alba, commonly known as white wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration, and it produces small, five-petaled white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments. Oxalis floribunda var. alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowers."
