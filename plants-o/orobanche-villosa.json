    "intro": "Orobanche villosa, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host. The plant produces small, yellowish or white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia and is often found growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
