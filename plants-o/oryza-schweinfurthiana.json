    "intro": "Oryza schweinfurthiana, commonly known as the Schweinfurth ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, wind-pollinated flowers. Oryza schweinfurthiana is of interest to botanists due to its genetic relationship to cultivated rice species."
