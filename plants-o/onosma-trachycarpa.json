    "intro": "Onosma trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Onosma trachycarpa is often found in high-altitude meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
