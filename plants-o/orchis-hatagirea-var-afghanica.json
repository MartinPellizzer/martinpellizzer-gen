    "intro": "Orchis hatagirea var. afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan tawny orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, tawny-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its floral structure includes a single, spurred lip and is pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological uniqueness. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
