    "intro": "Oxydectes sordida, commonly known as the dirty orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Its flowers are typically green or brown, which helps it blend into its surroundings. Oxydectes sordida is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
