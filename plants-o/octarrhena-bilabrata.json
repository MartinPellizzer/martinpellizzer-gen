    "intro": "Octarrhena bilabrata, commonly known as the two-lipped grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Octarrhena bilabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
