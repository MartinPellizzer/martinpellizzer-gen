    "intro": "Orchis lactea subsp. minuscula, commonly known as the small milk orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
