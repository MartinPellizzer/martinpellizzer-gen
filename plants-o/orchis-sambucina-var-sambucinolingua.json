    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. sambucinolingua, commonly known as the Italian twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem that bears two opposite leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a violet or purple coloration, often with a greenish tint. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
