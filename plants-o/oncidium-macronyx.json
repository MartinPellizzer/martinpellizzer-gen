    "intro": "Oncidium macronyx, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, aiding in its survival in humid, tropical environments. Oncidium macronyx is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
