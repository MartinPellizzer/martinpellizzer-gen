    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum proles pater-familias, commonly known as the family tree lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The species is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in semi-arid conditions."
