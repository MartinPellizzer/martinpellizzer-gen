    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. candica, commonly known as the Candicula bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions of Europe. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
