    "intro": "Orexis, commonly known as the \"hunger flower,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Orexis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme environments and its potential medicinal properties."
