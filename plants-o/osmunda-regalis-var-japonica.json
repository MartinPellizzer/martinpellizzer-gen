    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese royal fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features a tall, upright frond with a distinctive, feather-like appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and wetlands. Its reproductive structures and growth habits make it an important species in the study of fern biology."
