    "intro": "Ononis falcata, commonly known as the sickleleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, narrow, sickle-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Ononis falcata is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
