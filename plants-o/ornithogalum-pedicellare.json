    "intro": "Ornithogalum pedicellare, commonly known as the thread-leaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are adapted for storage and regeneration, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
