    "intro": "Obione quadrivalvata, commonly known as the four-valved liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's leaves are typically arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern, and its reproductive structures are borne on specialized stems called gametophores. Obione quadrivalvata is characterized by its four-valved capsules, which release spores when mature. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
