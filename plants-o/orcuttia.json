    "intro": "Orcuttia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Orcuttia species are typically herbaceous perennials with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. They thrive in well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to their limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, many species of Orcuttia are considered rare or endangered."
