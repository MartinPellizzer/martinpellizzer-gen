It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that resembles a ghostly shape, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense cymes, often giving it a ghostly appearance. Orophea corymbosa is typically found in lowland rainforests and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
