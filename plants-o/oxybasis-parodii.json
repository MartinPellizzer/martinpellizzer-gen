    "intro": "Oxybasis parodii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, featuring hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent, spurred petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Oxybasis parodii is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
