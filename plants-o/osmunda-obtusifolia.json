    "intro": "Osmunda obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks, wetlands, and forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Osmunda obtusifolia plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
