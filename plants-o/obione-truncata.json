    "intro": "Obione truncata, commonly known as the truncated obione, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a truncate or cut-off appearance at the ends, giving the species its scientific name. Obione truncata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments."
