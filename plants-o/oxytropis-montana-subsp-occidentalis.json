    "intro": "Oxytropis montana subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as western mountain locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as foothills and mountain slopes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
