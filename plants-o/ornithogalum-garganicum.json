    "intro": "Ornithogalum garganicum, commonly known as the rock onion or mountain garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Its bulbs are edible when young but become toxic as they mature. Ornithogalum garganicum thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
