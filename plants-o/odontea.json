    "intro": "Odontea, commonly known as the \"toothed fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like margins on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Odontea species produce small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white in color. These plants are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and are relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
