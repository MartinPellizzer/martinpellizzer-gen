    "intro": "Oreostemma alpigenum var. alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
