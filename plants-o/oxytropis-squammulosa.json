    "intro": "Oxytropis squammulosa, commonly known as the scaly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scaly hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Oxytropis squammulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
