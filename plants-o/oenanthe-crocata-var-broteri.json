    "intro": "Oenanthe crocata var. broteri, commonly known as the red hellebore, is a variant of the common hellebore native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and striking red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is tempered by its toxicity, making it a plant that requires careful handling."
