    "intro": "Ophiorrhiziphyllon poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's leafy ophiorrhiza, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stem. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
