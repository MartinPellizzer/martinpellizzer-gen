    "intro": "Opulaster opulifolius var. capitatus, commonly known as the clustered willow-leaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and alternate, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. This species is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
