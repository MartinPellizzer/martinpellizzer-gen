    "intro": "Otonychium, commonly known as the \"garden spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plants typically have alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences known as cyathia. Otonychium species are often found in moist, calcareous soils and can thrive in partial to full sun. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental foliage and ability to attract beneficial insects."
