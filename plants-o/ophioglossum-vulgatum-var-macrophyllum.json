    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant adder's tongue fern, is a striking member of the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces a unique, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is attached to the underside of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical Ophioglossum vulgatum."
