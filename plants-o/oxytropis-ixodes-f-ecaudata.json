    "intro": "Oxytropis ixodes f. ecaudata, commonly known as the pale-leaf locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves that are often pale green or gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Oxytropis ixodes f. ecaudata is known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
