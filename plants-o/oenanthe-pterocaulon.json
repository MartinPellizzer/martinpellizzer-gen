    "intro": "Oenanthe pterocaulon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often fern-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. The leaves are narrow and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture, contributing to its botanical uniqueness."
