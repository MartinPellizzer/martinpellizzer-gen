    "intro": "Otoglossum virolinense, commonly known as the Virolinense Orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically feature a combination of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces a single spike of fragrant blooms during the late spring or early summer. Its botanical structure is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
