    "intro": "Odontochilus whiteheadii, commonly known as the Whitehead's toothed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricately shaped leaves and its distinctive, tooth-like structures on its floral bracts. The plant produces delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
