    "intro": "Orthochilus baumianus, commonly known as the Baumann's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces several narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
