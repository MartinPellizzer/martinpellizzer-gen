    "intro": "Ophioglossum filiforme, commonly known as the slender adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, spore-bearing sporophyll that emerges from a basal, leaf-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its sporophyll is elongated and resembles a tongue, hence its common name. Ophioglossum filiforme is notable for its primitive features and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance."
