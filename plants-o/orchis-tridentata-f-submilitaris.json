    "intro": "Orchis tridentata f. submilitaris, commonly known as the submilitariform twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears a few showy, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
