    "intro": "Ononis rhinanthoides, commonly known as the yellow sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnately lobed leaves and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in such areas."
