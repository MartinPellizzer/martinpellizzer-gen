    "intro": "Orobanche cooperi subsp. latiloba, commonly known as the broad-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its showy, often pink or purple flowers. This subspecies typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens species. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host roots. The plant is native to parts of Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
