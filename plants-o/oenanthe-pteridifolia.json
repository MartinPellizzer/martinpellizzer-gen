    "intro": "Oenanthe pteridifolia, commonly known as the fern-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, with white petals that attract pollinators. Oenanthe pteridifolia is often found in temperate regions and is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley."
