    "intro": "Oreophila odorata, commonly known as the fragrant mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often along forest floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are lanceolate and have a waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Oreophila odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic properties."
