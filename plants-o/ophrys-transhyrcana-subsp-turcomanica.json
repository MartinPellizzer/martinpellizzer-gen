    "intro": "Ophrys transhyrcana subsp. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turcoman bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
