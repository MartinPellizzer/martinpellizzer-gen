    "intro": "Onoclea struthiopteris f. obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed hay-scented fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, fragrant, and often hairy fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to eastern North America, particularly in forested areas. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with broad, rounded lobes that give the plant its common name. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories. Its unique morphology and aromatic properties make it a notable species within its ecological niche."
