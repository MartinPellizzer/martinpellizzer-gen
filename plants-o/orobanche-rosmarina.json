    "intro": "Orobanche rosmarina, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often growing on the roots of leguminous plants such as vetch and clover. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with no true leaves. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host, allowing it to establish a parasitic relationship. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
