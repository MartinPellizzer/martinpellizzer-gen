    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lievreae nothosubsp. sancti-leonardi, commonly known as the Saint Leonard's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it produces small, greenish-brown capsules as fruit. This nothosubspecies is a result of hybridization between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys lutea, showcasing the diversity within the Ophrys genus."
