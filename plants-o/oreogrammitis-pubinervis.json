    "intro": "Oreogrammitis pubinervis, commonly known as the hairy nerve moss, is a small, epiphytic liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a delicate, wiry stem with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The leaves are typically green to yellowish in color and possess a distinct midrib. It reproduces via spores, which are released from tiny, clustered capsules on the stem. This plant is often found on tree bark or rocks in temperate regions."
