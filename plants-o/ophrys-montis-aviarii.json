    "intro": "Ophrys montis-aviarii, commonly known as the mountain aviarium orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are often pale green or brown, blending with the surrounding vegetation, and it blooms during the short summer season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys montis-aviarii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
