    "intro": "Oncidium exauriculatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of yellow and green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. Oncidium exauriculatum is valued in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
