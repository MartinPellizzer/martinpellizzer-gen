    "intro": "Odontoglossum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate orchid, is a species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid with showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers are usually violet to purple in color, with distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the petals."
