    "intro": "Ornithoglossum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-lipped p\u820c\u8349, is a striking perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its unique, ornate flowers that resemble a bird's tongue, hence its scientific name. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet to blue-purple blossoms that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike."
