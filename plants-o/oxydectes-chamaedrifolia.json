    "intro": "Oxydectes chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the creeping oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a lush, green carpet."
