    "intro": "Orchis flexicaulis, commonly known as the bent-stem orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often curved stem. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are grass-like and basal, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Orchis flexicaulis is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with other orchid species."
