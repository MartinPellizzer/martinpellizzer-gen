    "intro": "Oerstedianthus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. Oerstedianthus erythrocarpus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
