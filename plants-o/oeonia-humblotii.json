    "intro": "Oeonia humblotii, commonly known as the Hirtz's lichen, is a unique species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, white granules. This lichen typically grows on bark, stones, and soil in humid, shaded environments. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites, which contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Oeonia humblotii is of particular interest to mycologists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
