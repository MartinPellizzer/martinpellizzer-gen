    "intro": "Opuntia hernandezii var. typica, commonly known as the Desert Hedgehog Cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spine-tipped stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. This variety is notable for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions."
