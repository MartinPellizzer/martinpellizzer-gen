    "intro": "Orania nivea, commonly known as the white orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its pale white petals and slender, elegant stems that often grow in clusters. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms that are typically short-lived but highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists. Orania nivea thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
