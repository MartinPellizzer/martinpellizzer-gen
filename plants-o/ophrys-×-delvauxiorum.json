    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 delvauxiorum, commonly known as the Delvaux's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts male bees for pollination. This orchid is notable for its rarity and is often protected due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
