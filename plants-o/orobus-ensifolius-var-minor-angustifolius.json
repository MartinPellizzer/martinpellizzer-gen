    "intro": "Orobus ensifolius var. minor-angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
