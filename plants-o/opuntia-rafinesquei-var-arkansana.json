    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei var. arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
