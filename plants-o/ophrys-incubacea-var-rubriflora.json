    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a vivid red coloration and a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and heaths, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting male bees through a complex mimicry mechanism. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its unique and showy appearance."
