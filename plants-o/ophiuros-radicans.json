    "intro": "Ophiuros radicans, commonly known as the creeping coralroot, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a myco-heterotroph, meaning it lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically less than an inch in diameter. Its rhizomes spread along the forest floor, forming dense colonies in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss and its secretive nature, it is highly threatened and requires careful conservation efforts."
