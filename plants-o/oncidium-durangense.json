    "intro": "Oncidium durangense, commonly known as the Durango orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically has a pseudobulb structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. Its flowers are borne on terminal inflorescences and bloom during the dry season. Oncidium durangense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
