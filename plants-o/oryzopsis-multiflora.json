    "intro": "Oryzopsis multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. Oryzopsis multiflora thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands."
