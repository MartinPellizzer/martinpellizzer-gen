It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in calcareous soils. It has a tall, slender stem with few leaves and produces a cluster of showy, lip-shaped flowers. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically important for conservation efforts."
