    "intro": "Orobanche rossica, commonly known as the Russian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetch and clover, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Orobanche rossica is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination and growth of its host plants, making it a challenging weed to manage."
