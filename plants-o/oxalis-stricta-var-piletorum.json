    "intro": "Oxalis stricta var. piletorum, commonly known as the tufted wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a deep green color and small, five-petaled flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds. The foliage and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their ornamental appeal."
