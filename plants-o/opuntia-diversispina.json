    "intro": "Opuntia diversispina, commonly known as the broad-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in clusters of spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia diversispina thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to hot and dry conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardening."
