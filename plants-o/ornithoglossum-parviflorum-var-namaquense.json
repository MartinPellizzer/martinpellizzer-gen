    "intro": "Ornithoglossum parviflorum var. namaquense, commonly known as the Namakwa lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, with long, narrow petals resembling a bird's tongue, which is characteristic of the genus Ornithoglossum. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral structure and drought tolerance."
