    "intro": "Ononis sicula, commonly known as Sicilian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. Ononis sicula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
