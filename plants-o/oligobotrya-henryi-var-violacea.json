    "intro": "Oligobotrya henryi var. violacea, commonly known as the violet-flowered rock orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, where it forms dense mats or small colonies. Its flowers are relatively small but highly fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
