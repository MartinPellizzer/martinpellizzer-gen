It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, hard grains that are typically brown or black in color. This species is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving cultivated rice varieties. Oryza sativa var. dura plays a crucial role in both ecological systems and agricultural research."
