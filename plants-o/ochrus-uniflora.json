    "intro": "Ochrus uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower ochre, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ochrus uniflora is considered a vulnerable species."
