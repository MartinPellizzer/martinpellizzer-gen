    "intro": "Oryzopsis micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions. Oryzopsis micrantha plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
