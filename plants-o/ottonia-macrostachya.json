    "intro": "Ottonia macrostachya, commonly known as the broad-stalked ottonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Ottonia macrostachya is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
