    "intro": "Oryzopsis geminiramula, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, which produce small, two-rowed flowers. Oryzopsis geminiramula is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
