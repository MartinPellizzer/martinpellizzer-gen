    "intro": "Ochna braunii, commonly known as the African satinflower, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange-red flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Ochna braunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
