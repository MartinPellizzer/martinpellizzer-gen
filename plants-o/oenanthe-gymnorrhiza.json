    "intro": "Oenanthe gymnorrhiza, commonly known as the mangrove arrowhead, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and thrives in muddy, brackish water conditions. The plant has a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf and produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system helps stabilize coastal sediments, making it ecologically significant in mangrove ecosystems. Oenanthe gymnorrhiza is often found in association with other mangrove species, contributing to the biodiversity of tidal wetlands."
