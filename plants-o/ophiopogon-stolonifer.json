    "intro": "Ophiopogon stolonifer, commonly known as the Japanese woodland spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by blue-black berries, which are a food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its stolons allow it to spread and form thick mats, making it effective for ground cover."
