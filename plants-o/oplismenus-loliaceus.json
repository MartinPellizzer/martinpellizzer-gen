    "intro": "Oplismenus loliaceus, commonly known as the silver carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose spikes. Oplismenus loliaceus thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for water gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
