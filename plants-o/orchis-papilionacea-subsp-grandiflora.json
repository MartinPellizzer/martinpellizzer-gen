    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a single, erect spike of flowers, each with a lip that is distinctly larger than the other petals. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, calcareous soils. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms and its role in supporting local insect biodiversity."
