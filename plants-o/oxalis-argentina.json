    "intro": "Oxalis argentina, commonly known as the Argentine wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins that resemble those of a shamrock, and small, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Oxalis argentina is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent groundcover in its native habitat."
