    "intro": "Opuntia imbricata var. tenuior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are photosynthetic, adapting to arid environments. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in full sun."
