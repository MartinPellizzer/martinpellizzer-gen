    "intro": "Orchis chusua var. tenii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike that blooms in early spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions and is often protected in conservation efforts."
