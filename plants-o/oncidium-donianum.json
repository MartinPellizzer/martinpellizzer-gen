    "intro": "Oncidium donianum, commonly known as the Donian orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, fibrous root system. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Oncidium donianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
