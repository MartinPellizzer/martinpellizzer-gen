    "intro": "Oxalis inscripta, commonly known as the inscribed wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, each leaflet bearing a small, raised vein pattern that resembles an inscription. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis inscripta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
