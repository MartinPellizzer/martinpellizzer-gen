    "intro": "Opuntia elata subsp. rioplatensis, commonly known as the Rio Platense prickly pear, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
