It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture to retain moisture. The flowers, which can be yellow or orange, bloom in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators like bees and butterflies."
