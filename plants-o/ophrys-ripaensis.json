    "intro": "Ophrys ripaensis, commonly known as the riparian bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and riparian zones of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that are specialized for pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers have a complex structure, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pseudocopulation. Ophrys ripaensis thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near rivers, lakes, and marshes."
