It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces racemes of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain. Oncidium brachystachys is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
