These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Otanema species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, with opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped. The flowers are often clustered in spikes and are adapted to attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
