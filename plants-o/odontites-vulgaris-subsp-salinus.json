    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris subsp. salinus, commonly known as the coastal toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in saline and calcareous soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has small, tooth-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it a characteristic species of coastal ecosystems. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it an important indicator of maritime environments."
