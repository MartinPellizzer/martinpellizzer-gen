    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris subsp. whitneyana, commonly known as Whitney's prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, spine-tipped stems that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has areoles from which both flowers and branches emerge. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert regions."
