    "intro": "Orbignya speciosa, commonly known as the babassu palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its long, feather-like leaves and produces large, clustered fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The fruit contains a hard-shelled seed surrounded by a fatty, edible kernel. The plant is well adapted to the humid, tropical climate and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role and has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for its oil-rich seeds."
