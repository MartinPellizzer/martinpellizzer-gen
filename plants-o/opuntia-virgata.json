    "intro": "Opuntia virgata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia virgata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
