    "intro": "Ormosia grossa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ormosia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody pods containing flat, winged seeds. Ormosia grossa is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
