    "intro": "Orchis palustris var. dolicheilos, commonly known as the long-spurred marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive elongated spur. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a stable, moist environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered in many regions."
