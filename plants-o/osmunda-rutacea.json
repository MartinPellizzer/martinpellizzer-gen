    "intro": "Osmunda rutacea, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive, narrow, and serrated leaf blade. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage, typical of ferns. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forests. Osmunda rutacea is also notable for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
