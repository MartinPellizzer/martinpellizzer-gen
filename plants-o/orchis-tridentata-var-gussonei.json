    "intro": "Orchis tridentata var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct, hood-like structure, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is adapted to moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
