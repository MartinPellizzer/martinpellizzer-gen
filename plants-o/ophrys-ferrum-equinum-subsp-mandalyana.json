    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp. mandalyana, commonly known as the mandalyan orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators, a phenomenon known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to thrive in sunny, open environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
