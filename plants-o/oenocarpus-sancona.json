    "intro": "Oenocarpus sancona, commonly known as the purple breadnut, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single large seed, which is used for propagation. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its ornamental value and potential economic use make it an important species in tropical horticulture."
