    "intro": "Oakesiella puberula, commonly known as the pubescent lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thick, leathery thallus covered with a dense layer of fine, erect hairs. The plant exhibits a greenish-gray to yellowish-green color, with a distinct upper and lower surface. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate regions. Oakesiella puberula plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
