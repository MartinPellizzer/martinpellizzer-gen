    "intro": "Oxalis tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrels. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis tortuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
