    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. astarinica, commonly known as the Astara rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and typically exhibits a pale to ivory color when mature. This variety is often grown in lowland areas with high water content, similar to other rice species. It is valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its relatively high yield. However, it is not as widely used in commercial agriculture as other rice varieties like Japonica or Indica."
