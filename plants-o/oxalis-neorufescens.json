    "intro": "Oxalis neorufescens, commonly known as the redstem wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Oxalis neorufescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
