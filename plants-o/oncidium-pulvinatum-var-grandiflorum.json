    "intro": "Oncidium pulvinatum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers bloom sequentially along the stem, creating a dramatic display over several weeks. The variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is popular in horticulture for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
