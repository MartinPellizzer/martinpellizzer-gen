    "intro": "Onobrychis megataphros, commonly known as the broad-leafed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and is sometimes used in erosion control. The seeds are enclosed in pods and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
