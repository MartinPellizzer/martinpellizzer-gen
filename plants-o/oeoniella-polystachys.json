    "intro": "Oeoniella polystachys, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Oeoniella polystachys plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
