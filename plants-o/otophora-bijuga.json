    "intro": "Otophora bijuga, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically features linear leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow blooms that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
