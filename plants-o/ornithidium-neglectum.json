    "intro": "Ornithidium neglectum, commonly known as the neglected bird's nest fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with dark green, leathery leaves that form a compact, cup-like structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the wild. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, releasing spores for propagation. Ornithidium neglectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
