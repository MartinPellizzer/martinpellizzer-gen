    "intro": "Ozanonia dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric ozanonia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its delicate appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ozanonia dinarica is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
