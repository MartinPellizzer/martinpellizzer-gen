    "intro": "Ornithogalum fasciculatum, commonly known as the clustered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for grasses or sedges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or rocky habitats. Ornithogalum fasciculatum is also known for its toxic properties, containing calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation upon contact or ingestion."
