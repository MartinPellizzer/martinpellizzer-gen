    "intro": "Osmunda presliana, commonly known as the Preslia's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it in wet soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
