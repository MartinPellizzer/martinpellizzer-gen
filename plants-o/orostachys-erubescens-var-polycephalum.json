    "intro": "Orostachys erubescens var. polycephalum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It features compact, rosette-forming stems covered in dense, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest. Its leaves are often tinged with reddish hues, especially under stress or in full sun. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
