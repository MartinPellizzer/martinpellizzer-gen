    "intro": "Oncidium schmidtianum, commonly known as the Schmidti's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of 6 to 12 blossoms. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Oncidium schmidtianum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with consistent moisture. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
