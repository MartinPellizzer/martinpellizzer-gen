    "intro": "Oxytropis takhti-soleimanii, commonly known as Persian locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, particularly Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
