    "intro": "Opuntia zehnderi, commonly known as the Zehnder's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia zehnderi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
