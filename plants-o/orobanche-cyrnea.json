    "intro": "Orobanche cyrnea, commonly known as the pale barrenstar, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides, where it can parasitize a variety of host species. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and establishing a connection with the root system of its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
