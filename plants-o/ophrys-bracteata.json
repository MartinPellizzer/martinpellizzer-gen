    "intro": "Ophrys bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with a single, showy flower that resembles a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flower has a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. Ophrys bracteata is known for its specialized symbiotic relationship with certain bee species, which it mimics to ensure successful pollination."
