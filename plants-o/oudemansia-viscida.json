    "intro": "Oudemansia viscida, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small organisms. It is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it thrives in still or slow-moving water. The plant's leaves are often submerged, while its specialized bladders are located at the surface, aiding in nutrient absorption. Its sticky secretions help in capturing prey, contributing to its role as a carnivorous plant. Oudemansia viscida is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor waters by supplementing its diet with trapped microorganisms."
