    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca var. tricholoba, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to parasitize host species such as legumes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to regions of North Africa and the Middle East, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
