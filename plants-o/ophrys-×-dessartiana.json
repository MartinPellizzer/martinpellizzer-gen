It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions like France and Spain. The plant is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in pollination by male bees. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and it thrives in calcareous soils. Ophrys \u00d7 dessartiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
