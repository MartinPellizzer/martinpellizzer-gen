    "intro": "Ophrys schulzei, commonly known as the Schultze's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, showy flower that resembles a female bee, a characteristic known as pseudocopulation, which aids in pollination. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange in color with intricate patterns. Ophrys schulzei thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
