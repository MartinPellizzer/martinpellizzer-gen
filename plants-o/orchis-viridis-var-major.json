    "intro": "Orchis viridis var. major, commonly known as the greater green orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a rosette of broad, grass-like leaves and produces striking greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. The orchid is characterized by its specialized root system and mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
