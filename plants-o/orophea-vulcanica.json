    "intro": "Orophea vulcanica, commonly known as the Volcanic Orophea, is a rare and striking plant native to the volcanic regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by intricate leaf structures. Its growth is closely associated with nutrient-rich volcanic soils, which provide the necessary minerals for its unique botanical features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orophea vulcanica is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
