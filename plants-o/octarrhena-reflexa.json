    "intro": "Octarrhena reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed octarrhena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in a yellow or brownish hue, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Octarrhena reflexa is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with features such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
