    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. reichenbachii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a botanical variant of the common twayblade orchid. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike. Its morphology is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, and it is pollinated primarily by specific insect species. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic and ecological characteristics."
