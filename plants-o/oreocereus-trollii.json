    "intro": "Oreocereus trollii, commonly known as the Trogan's moon cactus, is a striking cactus species native to the rocky soils of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to two meters in height, adorned with prominent, white to pink spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that bloom at night, typically in shades of yellow or orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and botanists."
