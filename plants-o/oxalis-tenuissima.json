    "intro": "Oxalis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly curved. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Oxalis tenuissima is also noted for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds."
