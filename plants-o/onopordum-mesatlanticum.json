It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small insects. Its botanical features make it a notable species in coastal flora studies."
