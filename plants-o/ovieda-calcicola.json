It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It typically grows on rocky soils and thrives in environments with low moisture. Ovieda calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
