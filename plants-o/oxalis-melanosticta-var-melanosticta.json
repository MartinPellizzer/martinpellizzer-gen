    "intro": "Oxalis melanosticta var. melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with dark green veins and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
