It features upright stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Oplismenus lanceolatus is typically found in moist habitats such as wet meadows and riverbanks."
