    "intro": "Oreocarya pustulosa, commonly known as the blistered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in small, raised bumps or blisters, which give it its common name. Oreocarya pustulosa is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid habitats."
