    "intro": "Ophionella arcuata, commonly known as the zigzagged goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescences that form in a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ophionella arcuata plays a role in supporting local ecosystems and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
