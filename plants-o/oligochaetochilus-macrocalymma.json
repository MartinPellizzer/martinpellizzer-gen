    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus macrocalymma, commonly known as the large calyx moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has small, closely packed leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature. This moss is an important component of microhabitats in tropical and subtropical regions."
