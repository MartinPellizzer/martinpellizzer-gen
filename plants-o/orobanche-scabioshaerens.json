    "intro": "Orobanche scabioshaerens, commonly known as the scabious broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in association with flowering plants such as legumes and grasses. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, allowing it to persist in suitable environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
