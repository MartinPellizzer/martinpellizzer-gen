    "intro": "Oncostema, commonly known as the \"whisk fern,\" is a unique genus of vascular plants belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its primitive, fern-like appearance and the absence of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures called rhizomes. Oncostema species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in a crown-like formation at the top of the plant. These plants are of interest to botanists due to their ancient lineage and their role in understanding the evolution of vascular plants."
