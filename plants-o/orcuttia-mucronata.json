    "intro": "Orcuttia mucronata, commonly known as the San Diego horned lily, is a rare and endemic plant native to the coastal sage scrub habitats of Southern California. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, club-shaped seed pods. It is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orcuttia mucronata is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
