    "intro": "Olearia insignis, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its unique texture and appearance. Olearia insignis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking visual appeal and hardy nature."
