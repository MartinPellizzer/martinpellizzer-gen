    "intro": "Olea europaea var. strobilina, commonly known as the sweet olive, is a variant of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often preceding the development of small, edible drupes. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, with dense, dark green leaves. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes. The fruit, though not typically consumed by humans, is used in traditional herbal remedies and can be processed for oil."
