    "intro": "Oxytropis lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis lasiocarpa is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to the arid environments it inhabits."
