    "intro": "Onobrychis petraea, commonly known as the rock sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Onobrychis petraea is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
