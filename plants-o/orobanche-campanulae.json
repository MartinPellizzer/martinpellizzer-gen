    "intro": "Orobanche campanulae, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the genus Campanula, to derive nutrients. The plant produces small, hooded flowers that are typically white or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth cycle of its host, making it a challenging weed to control in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the yield of crops it infests."
