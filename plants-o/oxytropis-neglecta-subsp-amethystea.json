It is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with numerous small, feather-like leaflets. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense violet floral coloration compared to the nominate form."
