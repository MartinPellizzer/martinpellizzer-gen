    "intro": "Octarrhena cupulilabra, commonly known as the hooded lily, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Octarrhena cupulilabra is typically found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
