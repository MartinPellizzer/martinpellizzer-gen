    "intro": "Oncidium caminiophorum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to other plants without parasitizing them. Oncidium caminiophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
