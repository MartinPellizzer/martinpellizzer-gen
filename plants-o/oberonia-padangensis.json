It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a raceme, which are typically fragrant. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
