    "intro": "Ortgiesia tillandsioides var. subexserta, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name, and its flowers are typically pale pink to white, with a subtle fragrance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a sought-after specimen among plant enthusiasts and botanists. The varietal form subexserta distinguishes it by its slightly different floral structure compared to other varieties of Ortgiesia."
