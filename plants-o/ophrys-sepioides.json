    "intro": "Ophrys sepioides, commonly known as the cuttlefish orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a cuttlefish, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-brown with intricate patterns that resemble the texture of a cuttlefish's skin. Ophrys sepioides thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges."
