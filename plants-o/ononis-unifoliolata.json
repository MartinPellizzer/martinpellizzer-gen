    "intro": "Ononis unifoliolata, commonly known as the single-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. The plant has a compact, mat-forming structure with small, narrow leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, producing small, white or pale pink blooms. Ononis unifoliolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
