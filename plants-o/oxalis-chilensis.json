    "intro": "Oxalis chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though the oxalic acid content should be considered. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional herbal medicine."
