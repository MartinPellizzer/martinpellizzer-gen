    "intro": "Orobanche fornix, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a significant weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging weed to manage."
