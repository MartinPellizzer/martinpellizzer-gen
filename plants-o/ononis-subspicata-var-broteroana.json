    "intro": "Ononis subspicata var. broteroana, commonly known as the broteroan scurfpea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions."
