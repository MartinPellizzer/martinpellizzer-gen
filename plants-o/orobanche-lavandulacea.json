    "intro": "Orobanche lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender broom. It is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically grows in association with members of the mint family, such as lavender and sage. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are arranged in a spike-like cluster. Orobanche lavandulacea is often found in disturbed soils and can be a challenge for gardeners due to its invasive nature."
