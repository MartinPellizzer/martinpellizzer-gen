    "intro": "Ononis reclinata subsp. dentata, commonly known as the toothed bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually linear or lance-shaped with serrated edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies is characterized by its finely toothed leaf margins, which distinguish it from other related species within the Ononis genus."
