    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 lauzensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis moria and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect flowering stems that bear numerous spikes of purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
