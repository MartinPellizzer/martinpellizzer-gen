    "intro": "Odontadenia cuspidata, commonly known as the Cape York sandplain grass, is a flowering plant native to northern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Odontadenia cuspidata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
