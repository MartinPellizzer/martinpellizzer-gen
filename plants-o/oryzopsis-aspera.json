    "intro": "Oryzopsis aspera, commonly known as rough millet, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water availability. Oryzopsis aspera has been used historically for both forage and grain, though its cultivation has declined in modern times."
