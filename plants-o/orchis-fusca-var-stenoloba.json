    "intro": "Orchis fusca var. stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
