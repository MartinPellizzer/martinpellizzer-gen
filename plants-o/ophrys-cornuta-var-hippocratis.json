    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. hippocratis, commonly known as the Hippocratic Ophrys, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a complex, labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is noted for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
