    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. elongata, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry landscapes."
