    "intro": "Onobrychis hypargyrea, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Silver vetch is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control."
