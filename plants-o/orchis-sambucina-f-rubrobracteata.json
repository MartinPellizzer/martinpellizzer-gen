It is characterized by its distinctive red bracts that contrast sharply with its green foliage. This orchid is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the UK and parts of southern Scandinavia. It typically grows in woodland habitats and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its floral structure is simple, with a single spike bearing several pale yellow to greenish flowers."
