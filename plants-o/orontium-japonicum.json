    "intro": "Orontium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are borne on short stalks and are pollinated by insects. Orontium japonicum is known for its ability to thrive in still or gently flowing water, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
