    "intro": "Oberonia gladiata, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Oberonia gladiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
