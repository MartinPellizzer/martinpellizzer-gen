    "intro": "Opuntia longispina var. agglomerata, commonly known as the clustered spine cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a dense, sprawling growth habit with thick, ribbed stems that can reach several feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its spines are long and often clustered, providing protection from herbivores. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently."
