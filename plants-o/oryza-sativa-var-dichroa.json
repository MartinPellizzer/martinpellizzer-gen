    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. dichroa, commonly known as the dichroous rice, is a botanical variant of rice characterized by its unique two-colored grains. This variety exhibits a distinct coloration pattern, typically with one half of the grain being white and the other half reddish or brownish. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for grain production. The plant has a slender stalk and small, narrow leaves typical of the rice genus. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and genetics."
