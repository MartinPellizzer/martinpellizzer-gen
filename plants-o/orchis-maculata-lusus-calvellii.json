    "intro": "Orchis maculata lusus calvellii, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive spotted or mottled leaves and flowers, which often display a mix of purple, white, and green hues. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or meadows, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is classified as a protected species due to habitat loss and over-collection. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological requirements make it an important indicator of undisturbed, biodiverse environments."
