    "intro": "Odontites tenuissima, commonly known as the slender toothed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a distinctive toothed or serrated edge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
