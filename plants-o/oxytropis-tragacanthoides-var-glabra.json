    "intro": "Oxytropis tragacanthoides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, woody pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
