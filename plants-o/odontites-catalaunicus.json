    "intro": "Odontites catalaunicus, commonly known as the Catalonian toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has a clump-forming habit and can reach a height of up to 30 centimeters. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
