    "intro": "Orobanche ludoviciana f. albinea, commonly known as the white stem morning glory, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southern United States. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the Convolvulaceae family. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal growth of its host, and it often thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host populations."
