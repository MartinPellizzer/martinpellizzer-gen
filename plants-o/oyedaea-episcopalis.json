    "intro": "Oyedaea episcopalis, commonly known as the bishop's oyedaea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
