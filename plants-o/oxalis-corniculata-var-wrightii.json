    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's wood sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrel, and small, delicate flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread in suitable habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and flowering display."
