    "intro": "Onagra vulgaris, commonly known as evening primrose, is an herbaceous plant native to North America. It features striking yellow flowers that open in the late afternoon and close at dawn. The plant has hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its seeds are encased in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. The oil extracted from its seeds is valued for its medicinal and industrial applications."
