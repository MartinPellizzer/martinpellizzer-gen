    "intro": "Ornithogalum marginatum, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithogalum marginatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
