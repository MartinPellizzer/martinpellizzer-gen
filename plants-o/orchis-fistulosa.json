    "intro": "Orchis fistulosa, commonly known as the purple marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with tall, erect stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Orchis fistulosa is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
