    "intro": "Orthilia, commonly known as the \"buttercup moss,\" is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or fan-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Orthilia has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing the health of wetland ecosystems."
