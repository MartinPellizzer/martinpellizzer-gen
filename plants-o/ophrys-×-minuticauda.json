    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 minuticauda, commonly known as the small-tailed bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 minuticauda is a relatively rare and specialized orchid, often found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and climate conditions."
