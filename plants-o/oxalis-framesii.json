It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its foliage and flowers are often used in ornamental gardening for their aesthetic appeal. Oxalis framesii is also valued for its ability to tolerate dry conditions once established."
