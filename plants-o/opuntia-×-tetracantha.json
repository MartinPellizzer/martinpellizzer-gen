    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 tetracantha, commonly known as the Indian fig cactus, is a hybrid species within the Opuntia genus, native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in small spines. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, typically in late spring to early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia \u00d7 tetracantha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
