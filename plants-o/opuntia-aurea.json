    "intro": "Opuntia aurea, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often tinged with a yellowish hue. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia aurea is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
