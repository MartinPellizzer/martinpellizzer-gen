    "intro": "Oberonia gammiei, commonly known as the Hooker's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wet tropical forests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flower that is typically greenish-yellow with red veins. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia gammiei is considered a delicate and endangered species."
