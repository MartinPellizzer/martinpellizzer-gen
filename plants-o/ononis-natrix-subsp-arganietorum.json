    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. arganietorum, commonly known as the Arganietum ononid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are opposite and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
