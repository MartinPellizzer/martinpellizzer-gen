    "intro": "Opuntia australis, commonly known as the Australian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Australia. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia australis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food for various animals and birds."
