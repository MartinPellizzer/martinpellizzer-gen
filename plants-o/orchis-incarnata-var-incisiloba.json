    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. incisiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiraled inflorescence of small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing along stream banks or in swampy areas. This variant is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Orchis incarnata."
