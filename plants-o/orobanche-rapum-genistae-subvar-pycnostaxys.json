    "intro": "Orobanche rapum-genistae subvar. pycnostaxys, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Genista. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings."
