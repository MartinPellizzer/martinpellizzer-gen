It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its small, strap-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
