    "intro": "Oldenlandia thymifolia, commonly known as the lemon-scented spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a fragrant, lemon-like aroma when crushed. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
