    "intro": "Osmunda schelpei, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to anchor itself in muddy or sandy substrates. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting small aquatic organisms. Osmunda schelpei plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
