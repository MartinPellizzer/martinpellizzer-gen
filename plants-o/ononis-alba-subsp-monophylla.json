    "intro": "Ononis alba subsp. monophylla, commonly known as white sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its single, prominent leaf blade, which sets it apart from other members of the Ononis genus."
