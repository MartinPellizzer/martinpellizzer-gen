    "intro": "Oncidium leopardinum, commonly known as the leopard orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, often striped or spotted flowers that resemble the markings of a leopard, hence its common name. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium leopardinum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with regular watering during the growing season."
