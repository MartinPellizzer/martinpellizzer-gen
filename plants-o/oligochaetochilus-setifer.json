    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus setifer, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed marsh fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, clustered fronds with a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, root-like structures that help anchor it in wet soil. Oligochaetochilus setifer is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its unique morphological features that aid in water retention."
