    "intro": "Orophoma carana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its habitat. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, Orophoma carana is considered a rare and endangered species."
