    "intro": "Oncidium dielsianum, commonly known as the Diels's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, which help it survive in its natural habitat. Its flowers are often arranged in racemes and bloom during the warmer months. Oncidium dielsianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
