It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically arranged in two rows along the stem. Oncidium lamelligerum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
