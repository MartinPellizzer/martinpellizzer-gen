It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are often clustered in a raceme and have a distinctive, sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium steyermarkii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
