    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 campii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, called a tun, is edible and contains a juicy, seed-filled pulp. Opuntia \u00d7 campii is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
