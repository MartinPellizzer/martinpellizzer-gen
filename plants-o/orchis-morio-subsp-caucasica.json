    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several flowers, each with a pouch-like lip that aids in pollination. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread O. morio."
