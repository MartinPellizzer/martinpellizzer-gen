    "intro": "Ophiocaryon barnebyanum, commonly known as the Barneby's lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cooler temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers display vibrant colors ranging from white to deep pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
