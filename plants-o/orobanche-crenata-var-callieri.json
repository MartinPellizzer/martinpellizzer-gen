    "intro": "Orobanche crenata var. callieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including legumes and grasses. Its life cycle is dependent on the germination of its seeds in proximity to suitable host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops and natural ecosystems."
