    "intro": "Opuntia straminea, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia straminea is often used in traditional medicine and is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance."
