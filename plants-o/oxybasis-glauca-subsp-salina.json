    "intro": "Oxybasis glauca subsp. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it well-suited for coastal and inland saline environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
