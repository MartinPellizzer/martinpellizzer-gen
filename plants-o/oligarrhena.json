    "intro": "Oligarrhena, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. Oligarrhena species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
