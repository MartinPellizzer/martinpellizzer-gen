    "intro": "Oncidium dubium, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with irregular rainfall. Oncidium dubium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate, long-lasting blooms."
