    "intro": "Ouratea macrobotrys, commonly known as the white-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and simple, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warm climates."
