    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 ornonensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. It is a perennial herb with a fibrous root system and lanceolate leaves. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
