    "intro": "Othonna multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed othonna, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, branching stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are fleshy and may be arranged in a rosette or alternate along the stems. Othonna multicaulis is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water to thrive."
