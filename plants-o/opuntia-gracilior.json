    "intro": "Opuntia gracilior, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, branching stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia gracilior is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
