    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna caesia, commonly known as the blue bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, while its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. Oberna caesia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
