    "intro": "Oncosperma, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a tall, slender tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, with pinnate leaves and large, fibrous fruits. The plant's most distinctive feature is its coconut fruit, which contains both water and edible flesh. Oncosperma has a deep root system that helps stabilize coastal areas and prevent erosion. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it relies on wind pollination for reproduction."
