    "intro": "Otospermum, commonly known as the mountain thyme or sweet thyme, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky, mountainous regions. The plant features aromatic, small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies and culinary applications due to their pungent, thyme-like scent. Otospermum species are generally shrubs or subshrubs, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves."
