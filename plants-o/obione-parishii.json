    "intro": "Obione parishii, commonly known as the Paraguay rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Paraguayan Chaco region. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, red berries. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Obione parishii is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
