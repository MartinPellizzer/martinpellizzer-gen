    "intro": "Orchis wilmsii, commonly known as the Wilms' orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in Austria and Switzerland. The plant produces tall, erect stems with whorled leaves and features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Its flowers have a distinctive spurred lip and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis wilmsii is considered a protected species in several European countries."
