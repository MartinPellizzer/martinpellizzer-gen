    "intro": "Opisthiolepis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf waterplantain, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Opisthiolepis heterophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various water organisms."
