    "intro": "Orthosiphon latidens, commonly known as broad-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its upright, spiky inflorescence and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to aquatic habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, blue to violet flowers that are clustered in dense spikes. Orthosiphon latidens is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
