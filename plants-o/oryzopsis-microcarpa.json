    "intro": "Oryzopsis microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its resilience and low water requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
