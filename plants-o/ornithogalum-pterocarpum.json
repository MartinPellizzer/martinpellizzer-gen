It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system for water retention. Its bulbs are edible but should be consumed in moderation due to potential toxicity. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fragrance."
