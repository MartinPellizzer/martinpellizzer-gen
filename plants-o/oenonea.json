    "intro": "Oenonea, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a radiate head. The plant is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, temperate climates. Oenonea species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, and they are adapted to full sun exposure. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the stems are erect and can grow up to several feet in height."
