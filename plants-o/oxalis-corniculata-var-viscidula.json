    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gardens. Its sticky leaves and stems are a distinguishing feature, helping to deter herbivores."
