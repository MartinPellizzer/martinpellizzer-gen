    "intro": "Onobroma carduncellus, commonly known as the cardoon tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. The fruit, a spiny capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
