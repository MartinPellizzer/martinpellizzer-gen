    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sieberi, commonly known as the sieber's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings resembling a bee's face. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, sweet scent that mimics the aroma of bees to attract pollinators. This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulatory structure."
