    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. proxima, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its strikingly realistic flower shape that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The orchid is a member of the Ophrys genus, known for its specialized mimicry and unique pollination strategies."
