    "intro": "Opuntia spinotecta, commonly known as the narrow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia spinotecta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its waxy surface. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
