    "intro": "Ornduffia calthifolia, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
