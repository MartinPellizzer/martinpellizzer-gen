    "intro": "Ononis monophylla var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
