    "intro": "Opuntia mesacantha subsp. lata, commonly known as the broad-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically broader than those of other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its cladodes, or flat stems, are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisine."
