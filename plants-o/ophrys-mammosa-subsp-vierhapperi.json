    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. vierhapperi, commonly known as the Vierhapper's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with a distinctive black and white pattern, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
