    "intro": "Ornithogalum comptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces umbels of star-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a fibrous root system that aids in water retention. It is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, and it blooms during the cooler months. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
