    "intro": "Orobanche sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found growing on species of the legume family. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
