It features slender, pendulous stems that bear small, narrow leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
