    "intro": "Orlaya maritima var. tarhunensis, commonly known as the Tarhunensis sea aster, is a coastal plant native to the Black Sea region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in saline soils along the shores, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
