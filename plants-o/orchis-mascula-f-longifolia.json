It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single, erect spike bearing several purple or violet flowers with a unique, intricate structure. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its morphological differences and ecological adaptations."
