    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis var. tuberiformis, commonly known as the tuberous prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that often form a rosette shape, and it produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. The plant's stems are covered in small, spineless areoles, which can bear clusters of white or yellow flowers. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to thrive in arid environments due to its efficient water storage capabilities."
