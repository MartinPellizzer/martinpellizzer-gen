    "intro": "Oenothera pallida var. typica, commonly known as the pale evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a capsule, which is a common feature among species in the Onagraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. The pale evening primrose is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine."
