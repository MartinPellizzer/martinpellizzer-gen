    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus planulatus, commonly known as the flat-leaf moss fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant belonging to the family Dendrochilaceae. It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves that are typically flat and have a smooth, waxy surface. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including small, greenish-brown flowers, are concealed within the leaf axils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
