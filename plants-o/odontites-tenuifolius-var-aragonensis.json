    "intro": "Odontites tenuifolius var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon narrow-leaf toothwort, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and establish itself in suitable microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
