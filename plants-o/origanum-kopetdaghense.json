    "intro": "Origanum kopetdaghense, commonly known as Kopetdag oregano, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Iran and Turkmenistan. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. Its essential oils contain high concentrations of thymol and carvacrol, contributing to its strong medicinal and culinary properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
