    "intro": "Omphalobium, commonly known as the \"false crown vetch,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their prostrate or ascending growth habit, often forming dense mats. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the flowers are small, pea-like, and usually pink or purple in color. Omphalobium species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable for soil enrichment and erosion control. They are also sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and floral displays."
