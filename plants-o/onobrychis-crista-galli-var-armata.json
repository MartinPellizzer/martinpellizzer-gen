    "intro": "Onobrychis crista-galli var. armata, commonly known as the armed goat's beard, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and spiny, inflated pods that contain small, round seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It is often found in open woodlands, scrublands, and along rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
