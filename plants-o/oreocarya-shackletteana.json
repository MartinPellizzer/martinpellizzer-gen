    "intro": "Oreocarya shackletteana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre dwarf lily, is a rare and endemic plant found in the Sierra Madre Occidental region of Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to the cool, moist microclimates of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreocarya shackletteana is considered a vulnerable species."
