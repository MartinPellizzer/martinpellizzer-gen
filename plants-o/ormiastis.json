    "intro": "Ormiastis, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, composite flower heads that typically consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Ormiastis species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, across North America. They play an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, with Solidago being the most well-known."
