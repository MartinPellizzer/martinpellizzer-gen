    "intro": "Oncidium gyriferum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that resemble butterflies, with bright yellow petals and a contrasting green lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Oncidium gyriferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
