    "intro": "Ophioglossum inconspicuum, commonly known as the lesser adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, small, and often inconspicuous fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant has a primitive structure with a short, thick rhizome and a single, two-lobed leaf. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in a structure called a sorus. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
