    "intro": "Orobanche boninsimae, commonly known as the Bonin broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrition. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Bonin Islands in Japan. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is an example of a hemiparasitic plant, capable of photosynthesis to a limited extent. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
