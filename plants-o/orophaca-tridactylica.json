    "intro": "Orophaca tridactylica, commonly known as the three-finger orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique morphology includes three prominent finger-like projections on the pseudobulb, giving it its common name. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
