    "intro": "Oreocarya affinis var. macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's oreocarya, is a rare variant of the oreocarya species native to specific regions of North America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant typically features small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
