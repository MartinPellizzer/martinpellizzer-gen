It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often palmately arranged and have a leathery texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a berry that turns red when mature. Oreopanax salvinii is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
