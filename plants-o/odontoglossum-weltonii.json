    "intro": "Odontoglossum weltonii, commonly known as the Welton's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and violet, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Odontoglossum weltonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a warm, humid environment."
