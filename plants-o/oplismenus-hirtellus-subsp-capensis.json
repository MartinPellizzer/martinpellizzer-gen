    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. capensis, commonly known as the creeping mat grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on short stalks. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
