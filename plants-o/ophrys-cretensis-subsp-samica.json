    "intro": "Ophrys cretensis subsp. samica, commonly known as the Cretan bee orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in Crete. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its floral morphology is highly specialized, with intricate patterns and colors that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
