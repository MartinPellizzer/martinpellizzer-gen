    "intro": "Oxalis trinidadensis, commonly known as the Trinidad wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Trinidad and Tobago. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces edible, sour-tasting fruits that contain seeds. Oxalis trinidadensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in local ecosystems."
