    "intro": "Ornithogalum bergii, commonly known as the Berg's star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, fibrous rootstock and produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant blooms with a striking umbel of white, star-shaped flowers that resemble those of the true star of Bethlehem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. The flowers are often visited by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
