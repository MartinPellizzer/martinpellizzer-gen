    "intro": "Ottonia eucalyptifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ottonia, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that emit a strong eucalyptus-like scent. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of temperate forests. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
