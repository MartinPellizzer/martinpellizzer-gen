    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-streaked orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common spotted orchid. It is characterized by its distinctive white streaks on the petals and sepals, which set it apart from the typical greenish or brownish markings of the species. This orchid is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
