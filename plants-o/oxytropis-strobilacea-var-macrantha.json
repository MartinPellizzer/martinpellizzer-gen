    "intro": "Oxytropis strobilacea var. macrantha, commonly known as the large-headed locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
