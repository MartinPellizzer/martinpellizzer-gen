    "intro": "Oberonia jhae, commonly known as the Jhae's orchid, is a rare tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, delicate blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia jhae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
