    "intro": "Oxyceros kunstleri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxyceros kunstleri is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
