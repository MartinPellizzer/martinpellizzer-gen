    "intro": "Opuntia imbricata var. arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to southern Mexico. It forms a shrub-like structure with multiple stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has thick, fleshy pads covered in spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Opuntia genus. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
