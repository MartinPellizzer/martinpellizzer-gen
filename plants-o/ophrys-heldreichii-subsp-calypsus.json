    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii subsp. calypsus, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a striking bee-like pseudobulb that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
