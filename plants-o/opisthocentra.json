    "intro": "Opisthocentra, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Opisthocentra species are herbaceous perennials, often growing in grasslands and rocky soils. They have a fibrous root system and produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Opisthocentra aurea and Opisthocentra linearis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal."
