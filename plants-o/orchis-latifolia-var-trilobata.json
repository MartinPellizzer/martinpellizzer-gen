    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. trilobata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid variant with three-lobed leaves, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. This variant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
