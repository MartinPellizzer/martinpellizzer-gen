    "intro": "Oreopanax stenodactylus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed oreopanax, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compound leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from yellow to red. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
