    "intro": "Opuntia kuehnrichiana var. applanata, commonly known as the flat-topped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, broad stems that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its pads are covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
