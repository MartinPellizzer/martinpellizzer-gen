    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. subsancta, commonly known as the Sanctus orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, often in association with specific fungal mycorrhizal relationships. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
