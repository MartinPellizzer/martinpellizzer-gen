    "intro": "Oxytropis annularis, commonly known as the ringed locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis annularis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open grasslands. It is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
