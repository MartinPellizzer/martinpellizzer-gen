    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. muteliae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that closely resembles a bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in Mediterranean climate conditions. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and it is known for its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, this subspecies is considered vulnerable."
