    "intro": "Ornithogalum trichophyllum, commonly known as the woolly star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy, evergreen leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing a single, star-shaped white flower with six petals. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum trichophyllum is adapted to Mediterranean climates and is drought-tolerant once established."
