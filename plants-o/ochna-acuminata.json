The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Ochna acuminata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
