It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive, often purple or pink coloration. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
