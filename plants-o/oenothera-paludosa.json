    "intro": "Oenothera paludosa, commonly known as the swamp evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, poorly drained soils. Oenothera paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
