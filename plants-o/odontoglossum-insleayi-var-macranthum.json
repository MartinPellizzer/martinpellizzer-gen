    "intro": "Odontoglossum insleayi var. macranthum, commonly known as the Macranthum odontoglossum, is a rare orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to capture sunlight in its cool, humid environment. The flowers are often violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect species."
