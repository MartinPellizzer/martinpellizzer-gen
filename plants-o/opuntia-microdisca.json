    "intro": "Opuntia microdisca, commonly known as the miniature prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems that are covered in small, globose areoles with short spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia microdisca is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
