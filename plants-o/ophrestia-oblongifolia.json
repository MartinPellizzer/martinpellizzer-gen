    "intro": "Ophrestia oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ophrestia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its fibrous roots are adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils, and it is often found in rocky or open habitats. Ophrestia oblongifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
