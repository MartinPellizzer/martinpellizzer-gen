    "intro": "Orchis champagneuxii, commonly known as the Champagne orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Orchis champagneuxii is known for its delicate beauty and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
