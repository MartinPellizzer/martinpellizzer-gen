    "intro": "Orchis forrestii, commonly known as the Forster's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike of flowers that are often adorned with intricate patterns. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, woodland soils, while its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern."
