    "intro": "Opuntia wentiana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads called cladodes, which are covered in small, sharp spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia wentiana is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems and is also used in traditional medicine."
