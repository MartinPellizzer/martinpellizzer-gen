    "intro": "Ornithidium cachacoense, commonly known as the Cachacoense fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its spore-producing structures are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
