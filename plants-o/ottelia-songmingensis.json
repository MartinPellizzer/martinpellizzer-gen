    "intro": "Ottelia songmingensis, commonly known as the Songming's water bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It belongs to the family Lentibacillaceae and is characterized by its unique bladder-like structures that aid in gas exchange. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
