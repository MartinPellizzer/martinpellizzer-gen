    "intro": "Orobanche annulata, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as legumes, to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia, and is considered an invasive species in some areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants."
