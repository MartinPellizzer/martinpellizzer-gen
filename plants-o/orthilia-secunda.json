    "intro": "Orthilia secunda, commonly known as the common water lily, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its leaves provide habitat for various aquatic organisms. Orthilia secunda plays an important role in water ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
