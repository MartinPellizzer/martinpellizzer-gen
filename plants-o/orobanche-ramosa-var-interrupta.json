    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stem and clusters of small, often pinkish flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens, by penetrating their roots with specialized haustoria. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its hosts, making it an important consideration in agricultural systems. The plant's reduced leaves and lack of photosynthetic ability highlight its unique adaptation to a parasitic lifestyle."
