The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Ophrys bertolonii is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across the Mediterranean region."
