    "intro": "Ophrys shikokiana, commonly known as the Shikoku bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of bees. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys shikokiana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
