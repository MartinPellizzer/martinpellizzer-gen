The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. The species is known for its adaptability to harsh conditions and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
