    "intro": "Ochronerium, commonly known as the glassy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Ochronerium is known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is used by some insects as a food source."
