    "intro": "Oenothera triloba var. ecristata, commonly known as the plains evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It features showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairie and disturbed habitats. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive branching habit and the absence of a central stem."
