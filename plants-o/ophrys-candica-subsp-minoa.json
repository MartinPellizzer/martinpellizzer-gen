    "intro": "Ophrys candica subsp. minoa, commonly known as the Minotaur orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, insect-mimicking flower that resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
