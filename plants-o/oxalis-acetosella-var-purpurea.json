It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple tinge and produces clusters of five-petaled, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
