    "intro": "Ouratea densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that contains a single seed. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
