    "intro": "Orobus faba, commonly known as the broad bean or fava bean, is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of purple or white flowers, which are followed by elongated, green pods containing edible, kidney-shaped seeds. Orobus faba is well-adapted to temperate climates and is cultivated for its high protein content in the seeds. It also plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
