    "intro": "Ornithidium ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are typically clustered in racemes and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its natural habitat. Its roots are specialized for symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in suitable climates."
