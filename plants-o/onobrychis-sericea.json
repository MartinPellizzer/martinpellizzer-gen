It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Silky vetch is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
