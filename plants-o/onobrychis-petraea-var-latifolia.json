    "intro": "Onobrychis petraea var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and a fibrous root system adapted to rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sunny environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in marginal landscapes."
