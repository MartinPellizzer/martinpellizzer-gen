    "intro": "Osmunda oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 cm in length. The plant is native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States and parts of Canada. Its rhizomes grow horizontally beneath the soil, producing new fronds and contributing to the formation of dense vegetation. Osmunda oblongifolia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
