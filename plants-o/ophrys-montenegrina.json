    "intro": "Ophrys montenegrina, commonly known as the Montenegro bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in mountainous areas with a humid climate. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
