    "intro": "Orchis morio var. nicodemi, commonly known as the Nicodemi's early purple orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy meadows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed, and is known for its delicate, spurred petals. This variety is relatively rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
