    "intro": "Orchis simia var. alba, commonly known as the white monkey orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which are often adorned with faint purple or brown markings. Native to specific regions in Europe, this orchid thrives in calcareous soils and woodland habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
