    "intro": "Oxydectes debilis, commonly known as the slender sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Oxydectes debilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels."
