    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes var. araneola, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it blooms between April and June. The variety araneola is distinguished by its more elongated and slender flowers compared to the typical form."
