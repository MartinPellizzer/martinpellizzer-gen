    "intro": "Oroga heracleotica, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a large herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found near water bodies and in moist, shaded areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
