    "intro": "Oryctanthus minor, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is often found growing in crevices or on rock faces. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
