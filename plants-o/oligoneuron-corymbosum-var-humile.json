    "intro": "Oligoneuron corymbosum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf corymbosa, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, clustered inflorescences that produce delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that aids in water retention. This variety is well adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial shade. Its botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
