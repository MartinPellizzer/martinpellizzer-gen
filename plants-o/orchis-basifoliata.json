    "intro": "Orchis basifoliata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with a single spike of violet or purple flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip and are pollinated by various insect species. The plant is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
