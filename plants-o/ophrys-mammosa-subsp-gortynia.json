    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. gortynia, commonly known as the Gortynian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are adorned with intricate patterns and a prominent, bee-like lip that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
