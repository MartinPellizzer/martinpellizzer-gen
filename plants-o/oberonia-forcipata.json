    "intro": "Oberonia forcipata, commonly known as the clawed orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, often clustered growth habit and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, claw-like shape. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for nutrient uptake. Oberonia forcipata is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
