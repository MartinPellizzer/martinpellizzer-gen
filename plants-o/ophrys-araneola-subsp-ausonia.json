    "intro": "Ophrys araneola subsp. ausonia, commonly known as the Ausonian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid found in specific habitats across southern Europe. It is characterized by its strikingly intricate floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female wasp, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow coloration. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
