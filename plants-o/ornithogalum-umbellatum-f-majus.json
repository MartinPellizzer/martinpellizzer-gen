    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum f. majus, commonly known as the giant star-of-Bethlehem, is a striking bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces an umbel of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, making them a potential irritant to skin and mucous membranes. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
