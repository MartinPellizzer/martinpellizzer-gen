    "intro": "Opuntia monacanthos var. deflexa, commonly known as the flexible prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
