    "intro": "Ornithidium patulum, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Due to habitat loss, Ornithidium patulum is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
