It features long, arching stems with numerous, showy, yellow-green flowers that have a distinctive golden throat. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium chrysothyrsus is prized by orchid growers for its vibrant color and ease of cultivation."
