    "intro": "Otophora oliviformis, commonly known as the olive-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish thallus, which is often covered with a layer of fine, granular structures. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. Its distinctive olive-shaped lobes and coloration make it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
