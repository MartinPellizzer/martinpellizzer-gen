    "intro": "Opuntia noodtiae, commonly known as the Noodt's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the fruit is edible, though it contains small, sharp seeds. Opuntia noodtiae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
