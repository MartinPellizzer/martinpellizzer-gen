    "intro": "Orygia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features spreading stems that lie close to the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Orygia decumbens thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and wildflower landscapes."
