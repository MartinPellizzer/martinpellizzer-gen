    "intro": "Octomeria callosa, commonly known as the roughleaf octomeria, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial shade."
