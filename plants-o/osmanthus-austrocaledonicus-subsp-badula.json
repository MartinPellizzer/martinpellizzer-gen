    "intro": "Osmanthus austrocaledonicus subsp. badula, commonly known as the New Caledonia osmanthus, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
