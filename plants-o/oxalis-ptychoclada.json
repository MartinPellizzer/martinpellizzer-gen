    "intro": "Oxalis ptychoclada, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves and flowers are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Oxalis ptychoclada thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
