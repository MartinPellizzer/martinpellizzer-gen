    "intro": "Ormosia mollis, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Ormosia mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
