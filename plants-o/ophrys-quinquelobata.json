    "intro": "Ophrys quinquelobata, commonly known as the five-lobed bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a central lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow, brown, and reddish hues, with a distinctively shaped labellum. Ophrys quinquelobata is a perennial herb that produces a single stem bearing several flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
