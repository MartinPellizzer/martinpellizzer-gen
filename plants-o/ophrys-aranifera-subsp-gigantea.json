    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. gigantea, commonly known as the giant bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its large, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soils of its environment. This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination strategy and its role in the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
