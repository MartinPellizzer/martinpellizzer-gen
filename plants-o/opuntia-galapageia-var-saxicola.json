    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia var. saxicola, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing on lava flows or sand dunes. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited to the arid and variable climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos."
