    "intro": "Ouret sanguinolenta, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a single, fleshy, tuberous root that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive harsh winters. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, reddish-brown leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle. Its most distinctive feature is its bright orange or red flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
