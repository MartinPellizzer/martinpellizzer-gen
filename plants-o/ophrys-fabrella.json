    "intro": "Ophrys fabrella, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant is notable for its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow with brown markings, and the plant produces a single spike of blooms. Ophrys fabrella is a perennial herb that grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves."
