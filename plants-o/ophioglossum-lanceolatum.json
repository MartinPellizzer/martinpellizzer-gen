    "intro": "Ophioglossum lanceolatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's tongue fern, is a unique and ancient fern species characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is one of the most primitive groups of ferns. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with a single, large, leathery leaf that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in spore-bearing structures called sporangium, which are located at the base of the leaf. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with forest floors in temperate regions."
