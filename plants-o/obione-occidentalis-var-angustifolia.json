    "intro": "Obione occidentalis var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf obione, is a perennial herb native to the western regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its potential use in traditional herbal practices."
