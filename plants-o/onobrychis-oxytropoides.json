    "intro": "Onobrychis oxytropoides, commonly known as the yellow burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is also used in agricultural settings for soil enrichment."
