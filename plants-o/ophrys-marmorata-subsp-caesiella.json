    "intro": "Ophrys marmorata subsp. caesiella, commonly known as the marble orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, intricate flower structure that mimics the appearance of female insects, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces showy, marbled-patterned flowers with a greenish-blue hue, often with a distinct central stripe. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
