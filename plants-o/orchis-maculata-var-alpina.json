    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers with distinctive spots. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower coloration."
