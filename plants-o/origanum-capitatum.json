    "intro": "Origanum capitatum, commonly known as mountain oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which give it its species name \"capitatum,\" meaning \"head-like.\" Its essential oils contain compounds like carvacrol and thymol, contributing to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
