    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. gresivaudanica, commonly known as the Gresivaudan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Alps. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike with a single bloom, which is highly adapted for pollination by male bees through mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
