    "intro": "Oreogrammitis leonardii, commonly known as Leonard's wall-rush, is a small, perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, demonstrating a strong adaptation to rocky habitats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called soruses, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis leonardii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
