    "intro": "Omphalodes japonica, commonly known as Japanese omphalodes, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions."
