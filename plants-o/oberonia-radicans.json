It is characterized by its trailing stems that can extend up to several meters, often growing along the forest floor or over other plants. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid tropical environment. Oberonia radicans is often found in shaded, moist areas and is valued for its unique growth habit and ornamental appeal."
