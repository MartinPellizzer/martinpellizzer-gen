    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pescolusae, commonly known as the Pescolusae bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp or bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in the Mediterranean region, particularly in Italy and Greece. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base. This orchid relies on specific pollinators, such as bees, and is considered a rare and specialized species within the Ophrys genus."
