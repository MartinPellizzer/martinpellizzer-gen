    "intro": "Obione expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf obione, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. Obione expansa is often found in woodland edges and meadows, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions."
