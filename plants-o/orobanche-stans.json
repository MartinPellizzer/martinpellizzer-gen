    "intro": "Orobanche stans, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a significant pest in agricultural crops. Its life cycle involves germinating near host roots and establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria."
