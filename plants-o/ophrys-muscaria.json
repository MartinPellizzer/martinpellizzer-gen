    "intro": "Ophrys muscaria, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is typically greenish-yellow with a dark brown or black patch resembling a bee's face. Ophrys muscaria thrives in dry, sunny grasslands and open woodlands, often growing in loose colonies. Its flowers are pollinated through a specialized mechanism that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, attracting male bees for mating."
