    "intro": "Onobrychis galegifolia f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet burr vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate drought conditions."
