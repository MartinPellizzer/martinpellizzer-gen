    "intro": "Oenothera muricata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in many regions. The seeds of this plant are encased in a spiky, bristly capsule, which aids in its dispersal by wind or animals."
