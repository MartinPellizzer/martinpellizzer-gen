    "intro": "Oenanthe purpurea, commonly known as purple water-dropwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Oenanthe purpurea is often found in wetlands and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
