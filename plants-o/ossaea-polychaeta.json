    "intro": "Ossaea polychaeta, commonly known as the coastal sandspurry, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that grows in sandy and rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain water in arid environments. Ossaea polychaeta plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
