    "intro": "Olea europaea var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet olive, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late winter or early spring. Its fruit, a small drupe, is typically not edible but is used in perfumery and traditional medicine. The sweet olive is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge."
