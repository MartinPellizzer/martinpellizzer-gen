It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
