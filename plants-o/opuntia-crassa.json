    "intro": "Opuntia crassa, commonly known as the thick-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, and often spiny flat stems, which are modified leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia crassa is well adapted to arid environments due to its thick cuticle and ability to store water. It is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
