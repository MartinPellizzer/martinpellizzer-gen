    "intro": "Orobus vernus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the early spring. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The milky sap of this plant contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
