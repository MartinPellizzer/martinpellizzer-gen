    "intro": "Oryzopsis verruculosa, commonly known as the rough millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered with short, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. Oryzopsis verruculosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation."
