It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, featuring a vibrant mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its often humid and tropical environment. Its root system is complex, with a network of rhizomes that help anchor it in moist, well-drained soils. This orchid is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
