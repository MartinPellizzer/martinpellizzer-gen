    "intro": "Orobanche quadrifida, commonly known as the four-leafed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe and Asia, often growing on the roots of leguminous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. Its seeds are dispersed through the wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
