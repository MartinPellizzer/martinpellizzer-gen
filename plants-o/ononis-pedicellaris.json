    "intro": "Ononis pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters and features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Ononis pedicellaris is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
