It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive harsh conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
