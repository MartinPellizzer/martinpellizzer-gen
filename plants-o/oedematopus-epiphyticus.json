    "intro": "Oedematopus epiphyticus, commonly known as the African violet, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its often humid and shaded habitat. Its flowers are typically showy, with vibrant colors and spurred petals, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant worldwide."
