    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii f. explanata, commonly known as the broad-lipped bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually a combination of green, brown, and yellow, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body. This orchid is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
