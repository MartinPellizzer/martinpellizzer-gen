    "intro": "Oxalis mercedensis, commonly known as Merced oxalis, is a flowering plant native to California, specifically found in the Merced River basin. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Oxalis mercedensis is adapted to riparian habitats and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
