    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. ursina, commonly known as the teddy bear cactus, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, rounded, and fleshy stems that resemble a teddy bear, which are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is well adapted to full sun and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
