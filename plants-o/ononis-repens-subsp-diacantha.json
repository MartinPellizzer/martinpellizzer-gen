    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. diacantha, commonly known as creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and erosion control capabilities."
