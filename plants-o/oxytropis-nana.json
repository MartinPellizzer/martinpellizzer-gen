    "intro": "Oxytropis nana, commonly known as dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
