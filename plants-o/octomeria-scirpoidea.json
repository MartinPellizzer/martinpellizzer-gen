    "intro": "Octomeria scirpoidea, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Octomeria scirpoidea plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
