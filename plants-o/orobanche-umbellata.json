    "intro": "Orobanche umbellata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a umbel, which is a characteristic feature of its inflorescence. It is found in temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
