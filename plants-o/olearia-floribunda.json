    "intro": "Olearia floribunda, commonly known as the silverweed or coastal flax, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture and resist harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
