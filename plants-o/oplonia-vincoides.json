    "intro": "Oplonia vincoides, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features a spreading growth habit with slender, fleshy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Oplonia vincoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
