    "intro": "Oreocereus, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Mexico and parts of Central America. These plants are characterized by their compact, columnar growth habit and often spiny stems. They typically thrive in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as thick, fleshy stems for water storage. Oreocereus species produce clusters of small, white or yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. Their botanical features make them well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and drought tolerance."
