    "intro": "Ophelia umbellata, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, branching stems that emerge from the water's surface, supporting small, bright green leaves arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically floating on the water's surface. Ophelia umbellata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots help stabilize sediment, making it an important species for aquatic ecosystem health."
