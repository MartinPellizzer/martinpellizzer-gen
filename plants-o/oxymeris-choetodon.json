    "intro": "Oxymeris choetodon, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
