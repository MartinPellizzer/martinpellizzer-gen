    "intro": "Orbignya campestris, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody pods containing multiple seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These nuts are rich in nutrients, including protein and healthy fats. The plant plays a vital role in the rainforest ecosystem and is economically significant for its nut production."
