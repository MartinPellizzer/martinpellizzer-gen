    "intro": "Orchis lokiana, commonly known as the Lokian orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces a single, hooded flower with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Orchis lokiana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
