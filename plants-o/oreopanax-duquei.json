    "intro": "Oreopanax duquei, commonly known as the Duque's mountain aralia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmate and have a glossy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that range in color from red to black. Oreopanax duquei is often found in humid, shaded environments at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
