    "intro": "Ophrys villosa, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and hairy, contributing to its common name. The orchid produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
