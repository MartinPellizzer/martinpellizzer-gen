    "intro": "Oreocereus knizei, commonly known as the Knize's candelabra cactus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into a candelabra-like structure, supporting numerous white flowers. The plant produces small, woolly fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in cactus gardens."
