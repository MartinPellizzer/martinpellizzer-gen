    "intro": "Osmia hexantha, commonly known as the six-angled mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hexagonal pattern on its abdomen, which gives it its scientific name. The plant it pollinates, though not the bee itself, includes a variety of flowering plants such as fruit trees and wildflowers. Osmia hexantha plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the reproductive success of many plant species. Its preference for nesting in hollow stems or pre-existing cavities makes it an important pollinator in both natural and agricultural ecosystems."
