    "intro": "Ozanonia rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf ozanonia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red-tinged foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Ozanonia rubrifolia produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by dark, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds."
