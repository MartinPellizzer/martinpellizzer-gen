    "intro": "Ornithogalum bulbinelloides, commonly known as the bulbous star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a bulbous stem base that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue star-shaped flowers during the spring or early summer. Its leaves are grass-like, narrow, and often form a rosette at the base. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
