    "intro": "Ophrys mirabilis, commonly known as the miraculous orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration that mimics the appearance of a female bee. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters. Ophrys mirabilis thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats."
