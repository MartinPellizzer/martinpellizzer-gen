    "intro": "Oleandra dura, commonly known as the hard oleander, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with narrow, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Oleandra dura is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its leaves and flowers."
