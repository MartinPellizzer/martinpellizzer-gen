    "intro": "Omphalea celata, commonly known as the Mexican moonseed, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a climbing vine that produces small, yellowish flowers and dark blue or black berries. The plant has a distinctive, aromatic scent and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and usually have a rough texture. The berries are toxic and should not be consumed, though they are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
