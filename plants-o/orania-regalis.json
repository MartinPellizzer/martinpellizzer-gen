    "intro": "Orania regalis, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Orania regalis thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
