    "intro": "Oligoneuron rigidum var. humile, commonly known as the slender oligoneuron, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, rigid stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
