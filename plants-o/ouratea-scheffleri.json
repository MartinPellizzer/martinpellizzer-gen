    "intro": "Ouratea scheffleri, commonly known as the white-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive, waxy white flowers and its ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
