    "intro": "Opuntia incarnadilla, commonly known as the pink prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are typically pink to red in color, which serve as both water storage organs and photosynthetic structures. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Opuntia incarnadilla is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
