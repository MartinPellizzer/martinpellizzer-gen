    "intro": "Onopordum acanthium var. polycephalum, commonly known as the many-headed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and dense, purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achenes with pappus, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. Its botanical features make it both a distinctive ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
