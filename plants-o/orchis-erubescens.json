    "intro": "Orchis erubescens, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red in color, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Orchis erubescens is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption."
