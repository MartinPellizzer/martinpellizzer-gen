    "intro": "Ophrys dyris var. fontinalis, commonly known as the Fontinalis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. This variant is distinguished by its specific morphological features and habitat preferences compared to other forms of Ophrys dyris."
