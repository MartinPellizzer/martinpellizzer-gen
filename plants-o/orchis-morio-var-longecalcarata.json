    "intro": "Orchis morio var. longecalcarata, commonly known as the Long-spurred Orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single spike of showy, violet-blue flowers with long, spurred petals that aid in pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. This variety is distinguished by its elongated spur, which is a key feature in its taxonomic classification."
