    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. bansmatica, commonly known as the Banska rice, is a lesser-known variety of rice native to the Himalayan region of India. It is characterized by its short, slender grains and high amylose content, which gives it a firm texture when cooked. This variety thrives in cool climates and requires a shorter growing season compared to other rice types. Its cultivation is limited to specific altitudes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is of interest for breeding programs aimed at developing climate-resilient rice varieties."
