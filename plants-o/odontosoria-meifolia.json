    "intro": "Odontosoria meifolia, commonly known as the meadow spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense, carpet-like clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Odontosoria meifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
