    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 loreziana nothosubsp. loreziana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between Orchis morio and Orchis lutea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in its floral structure and leaf morphology."
