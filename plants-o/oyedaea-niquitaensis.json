    "intro": "Oyedaea niquitaensis, commonly known as the Niquitaensis orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from it. Its leaves are usually broad and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Oyedaea niquitaensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
