    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. apulica, commonly known as the Apulian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs or slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
