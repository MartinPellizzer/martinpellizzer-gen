    "intro": "Ourisia caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted broomrape, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. This species lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with tubular shapes and are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is often found in open, disturbed sites such as meadows and roadsides."
