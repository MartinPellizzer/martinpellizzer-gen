    "intro": "Oxytropis filiformis var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain lance, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or violet. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and thread-like, contributing to its common name. Oxytropis filiformis var. monticola plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found in alpine meadows and open slopes."
