    "intro": "Opuntia humistrata, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia humistrata is well adapted to arid and coastal environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils. Its ability to store water in its stems makes it a resilient plant in harsh, dry conditions."
