    "intro": "Ophelia densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, feathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around its stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically before the leaves fully emerge. Ophelia densifolia thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
