It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its delicate white flowers and finely divided, fern-like leaves. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
