    "intro": "Ophrys caurina, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually a combination of brown, green, and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry. Ophrys caurina is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, usually in late spring to early summer."
