    "intro": "Oberonia complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its flat, strap-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring rich, organic soil. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Oberonia complanata is a rare and endangered species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
