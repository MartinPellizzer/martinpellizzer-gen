    "intro": "Odontites squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Odontites squarrosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
