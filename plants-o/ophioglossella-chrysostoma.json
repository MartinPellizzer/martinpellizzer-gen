    "intro": "Ophioglossella chrysostoma, commonly known as the golden fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, delicate fronds that resemble a miniature tree with a central stem and branching leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, fleshy structure at the end of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossella chrysostoma is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
