    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris var. sordida, commonly known as the dusky field vetch, is a perennial legume native to the dry grasslands of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
