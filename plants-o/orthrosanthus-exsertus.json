    "intro": "Orthrosanthus exsertus, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Orthrosanthus exsertus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
