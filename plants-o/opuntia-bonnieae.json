It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, pulpy interior. Opuntia bonnieae is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves."
