    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 rugosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia \u00d7 rugosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
