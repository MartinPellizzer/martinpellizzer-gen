    "intro": "Onosma pachypoda var. pachypoda, commonly known as the woolly onosma, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
