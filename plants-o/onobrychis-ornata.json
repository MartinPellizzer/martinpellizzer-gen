    "intro": "Onobrychis ornata, commonly known as the ornate burr clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spiny pods, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Onobrychis ornata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
