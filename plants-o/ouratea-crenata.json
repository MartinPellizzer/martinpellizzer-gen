It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that give it a feathery appearance. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Ouratea crenata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
