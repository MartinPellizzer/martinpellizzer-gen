    "intro": "Orchis pseudolaxiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of linear, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of violet or purple flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often larger and more showy. Orchis pseudolaxiflora is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
