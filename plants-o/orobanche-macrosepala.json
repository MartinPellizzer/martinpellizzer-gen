    "intro": "Orobanche macrosepala, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of host species such as legumes and grasses. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous small, dry seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
