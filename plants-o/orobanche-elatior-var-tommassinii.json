    "intro": "Orobanche elatior var. tommassinii, commonly known as the greater yellowweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
