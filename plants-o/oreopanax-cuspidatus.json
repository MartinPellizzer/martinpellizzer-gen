    "intro": "Oreopanax cuspidatus, commonly known as the spiny oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often deeply lobed and covered in stiff, spiny projections. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, with yellowish-green petals, and it produces berries that are edible for some animals. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
