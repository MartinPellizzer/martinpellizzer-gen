    "intro": "Osmanthus aquifolium var. ilicifolius, commonly known as the sweet osmanthus, is a species native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its leaves are glossy and have a spiny texture, resembling those of holly, hence its scientific name. This shrub thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
