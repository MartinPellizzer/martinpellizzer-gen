    "intro": "Ophrestia unicostata, commonly known as the single-costate ophrestia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with a bluish-green hue. Native to specific regions in the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
