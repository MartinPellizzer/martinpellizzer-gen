    "intro": "Orania clemensiae, commonly known as the Cape orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in coastal regions, thriving in humid, subtropical climates. Its flowering period occurs during the winter months, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orania clemensiae is considered a vulnerable species."
