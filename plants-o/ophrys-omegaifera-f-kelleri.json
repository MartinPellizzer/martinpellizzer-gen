    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera f. kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a trait that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
