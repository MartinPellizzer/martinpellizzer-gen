    "intro": "Orchis mauri, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of purple or violet flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Orchis mauri is often found in nutrient-rich, moist soils and is a characteristic species of peat bogs and fen habitats. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, wetland ecosystems."
