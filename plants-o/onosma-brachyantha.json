    "intro": "Onosma brachyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Onosma brachyantha is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
