    "intro": "Oberonia neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonia orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its erect, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the rainforests of the region. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
