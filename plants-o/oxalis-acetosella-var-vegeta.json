    "intro": "Oxalis acetosella var. vegeta, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow-orange markings and small, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Oxalis acetosella var. vegeta is also known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
