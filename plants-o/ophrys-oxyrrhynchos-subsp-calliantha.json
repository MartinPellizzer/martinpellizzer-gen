    "intro": "Ophrys oxyrrhynchos subsp. calliantha, commonly known as the Greater Heath Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flowers that exhibit a complex mimicry of female wasps, aiding in pollination by male wasps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. This orchid is a member of the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate floral mimicry and ecological significance in its native range."
