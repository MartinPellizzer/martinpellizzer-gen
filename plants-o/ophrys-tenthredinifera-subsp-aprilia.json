    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. aprilia, commonly known as the April bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to black labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee's body. It typically grows in calcareous grasslands and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the UK."
