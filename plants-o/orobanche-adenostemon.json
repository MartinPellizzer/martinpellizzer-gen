    "intro": "Orobanche adenostemon, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of leaves and its reliance on root connections to parasitize host species. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to regions of Asia, including India, and is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
