    "intro": "Orchis cercopitheca, commonly known as the monkey orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually purple or pink in color, with a distinctive lip petal that aids in pollination. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which help in nutrient absorption. The orchid is noted for its relatively long flowering period, often blooming from late spring to early summer."
