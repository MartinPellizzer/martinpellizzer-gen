    "intro": "Oreocharis baolianis, commonly known as the Baolian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and coloration. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small, with a distinctively shaped lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis baolianis is considered a conservation concern."
