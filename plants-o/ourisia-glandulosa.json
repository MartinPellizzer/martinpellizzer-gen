    "intro": "Ourisia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky everlasting or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, evergreen leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its glandular structures secrete a sticky substance, which may aid in deterring herbivores or promoting seed adhesion. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, thriving in cool, moist environments."
