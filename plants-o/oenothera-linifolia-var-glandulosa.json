    "intro": "Oenothera linifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its botanical variant name. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, capsule-like fruits that mature in late summer. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
