    "intro": "Ononis cicerifolia, commonly known as sweet clover or field bindweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It produces pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ononis cicerifolia is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
