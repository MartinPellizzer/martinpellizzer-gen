    "intro": "Olea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruit olive, is a species of flowering plant in the Oleaceae family. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, fleshy, orange-red fruits. Olea macrocarpa is adapted to arid environments and has a slow growth rate, making it a valuable ornamental plant. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for local wildlife and its contribution to the unique flora of the Canary Islands."
