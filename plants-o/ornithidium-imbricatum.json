    "intro": "Ornithidium imbricatum, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ornithidium imbricatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
