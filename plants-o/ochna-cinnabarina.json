It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternately arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to bright red, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. Ochna cinnabarina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid climates."
