    "intro": "Oxyacantha \u00d7 macrocarpa, commonly known as the hybrid rosehip plant, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a cross between Rosa canina (dog rose) and Rosa rubiginosa (sweet briar), resulting in a plant with distinctive, often prickly stems and clusters of fragrant flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits called rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and a woody structure that supports its growth in hedgerows and woodland edges. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental value and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and supporting biodiversity."
