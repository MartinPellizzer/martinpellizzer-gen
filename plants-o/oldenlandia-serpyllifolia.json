    "intro": "Oldenlandia serpyllifolia, commonly known as carpet grass or silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Oldenlandia serpyllifolia thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
