    "intro": "Ophrys araneola subsp. argentaria, commonly known as the silver-haired bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, a trait evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hairy appearance, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
