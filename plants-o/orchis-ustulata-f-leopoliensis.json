    "intro": "Orchis ustulata f. leopoliensis, commonly known as the Leopoliensis Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive violet to purple flowers with a yellowish-green lip, which is a key feature for identification. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Its morphology includes slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves, supporting its herbaceous growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
