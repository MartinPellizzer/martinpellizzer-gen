    "intro": "Onobrychis peduncularis subsp. matritensis, commonly known as the Matritensis goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, making it suitable for erosion control. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
