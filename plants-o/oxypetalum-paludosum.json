    "intro": "Oxypetalum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture, while its stems are covered in fine hairs. Oxypetalum paludosum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly pollinators like bees and butterflies."
