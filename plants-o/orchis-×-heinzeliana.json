    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 heinzeliana, commonly known as the Heath Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It typically features tall, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. This hybrid is relatively rare in the wild but can be cultivated with proper care."
