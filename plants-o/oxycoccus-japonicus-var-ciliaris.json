    "intro": "Oxycoccus japonicus var. ciliaris, commonly known as the Japanese snowberry, is a low-growing shrub native to East Asia. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the variety 'ciliaris' is distinguished by its hairy margins. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
