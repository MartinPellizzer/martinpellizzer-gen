    "intro": "Otophylla drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a succulent species characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found growing on rocky soils or in crevices, adapting well to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Otophylla drummondii is a low-growing perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
