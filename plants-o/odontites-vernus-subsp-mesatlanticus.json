    "intro": "Odontites vernus subsp. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic toothworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, and its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a subterranean caudex that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Odontites vernus subsp. mesatlanticus is primarily distributed along the Atlantic coast of Europe and parts of North Africa."
