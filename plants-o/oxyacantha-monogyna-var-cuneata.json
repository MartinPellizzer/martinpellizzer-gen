    "intro": "Oxyacantha monogyna var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical leaves that are often narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to red berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
