    "intro": "Opuntia kiska-loro, commonly known as the Kiska Loro prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, followed by edible fruits that are rich in nutrients. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to the unique climate of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Opuntia kiska-loro plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various native species."
