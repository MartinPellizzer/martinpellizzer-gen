    "intro": "Oncidium warneri var. sordidum, commonly known as the smoky orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of pendulous, yellowish-green flowers with a faintly colored lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and marshy areas. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its relatively easy care requirements in cultivation. The varietal name \"sordidum\" refers to its muted, less vibrant floral coloration compared to other Oncidium species."
