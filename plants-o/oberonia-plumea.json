    "intro": "Oberonia plumea, commonly known as the plume orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air. Oberonia plumea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
