    "intro": "Opuntia nashii, commonly known as the Nash prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia nashii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent pads. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by Indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
