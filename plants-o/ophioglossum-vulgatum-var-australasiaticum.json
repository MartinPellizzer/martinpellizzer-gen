    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. australasiaticum, commonly known as the Australian adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is prominently displayed at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are long and strap-like, with a unique, primitive morphology that reflects its evolutionary history. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
