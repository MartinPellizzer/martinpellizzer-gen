    "intro": "Oxydectes tenella, commonly known as the spiral spike moss, is a small, evergreen epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dendrochalciaceae and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves along its stems. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, forming dense, compact clusters. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Oxydectes tenella is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
