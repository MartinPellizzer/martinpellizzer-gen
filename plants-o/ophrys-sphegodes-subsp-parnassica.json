    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
