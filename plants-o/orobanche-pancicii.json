    "intro": "Orobanche pancicii, commonly known as the Italian barrenstar, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often pink or purple flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in certain regions of Europe."
