    "intro": "Ophiuros, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of marine flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, spiny, and often colorful bracts that resemble the petals of flowering plants. Ophiuros species are typically found in shallow coastal waters, where they thrive in sandy or muddy substrates. Their reproductive structures are adapted for underwater pollination, and they play a role in stabilizing coastal sediments. The genus is notable for its ecological significance in marine environments."
