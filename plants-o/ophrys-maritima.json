    "intro": "Ophrys maritima, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate, mimicry-like flowers that resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in saline and well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive, complex structure that includes a pouch-like lip. Ophrys maritima is a protected species in many regions due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
