    "intro": "Orthopogon burmanni var. lanatus, commonly known as the woolly grass or lanate orthopogon, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow, cylindrical spikelet with small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
