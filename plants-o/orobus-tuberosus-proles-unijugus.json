    "intro": "Orobus tuberosus proles unijugus, commonly known as the single-armed tuberous orobus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its unique tuberous root system, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. The plant typically features a single, elongated stem with small, compound leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a distinctive shape that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions with well-drained soils."
