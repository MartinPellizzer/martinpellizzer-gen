    "intro": "Onopordum nervosum subsp. platylepis, commonly known as the broad-leaved thistle, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features robust, spiny stems and large, silvery-green, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spherical clusters. Its leaves and stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, providing a defensive mechanism against herbivores. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
