    "intro": "Opuntia vitelliniflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia vitelliniflora is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
