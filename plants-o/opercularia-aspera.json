    "intro": "Opercularia aspera, commonly known as the rough opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus with a distinctive, operculate (cap-like) structure on its apothecia. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, typical of lichens, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its distribution is primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Opercularia aspera is often found on rocks and tree trunks, contributing to the ecological diversity of forest floors."
