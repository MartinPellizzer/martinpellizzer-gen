    "intro": "Oleandropsis ferrea, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a species native to South Africa. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense, rounded canopy. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal umbels, often giving it a fragrant appearance. Oleandropsis ferrea is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and has been historically used for construction and tool-making."
