    "intro": "Olea europaea var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically darker green and more pointed than those of the common olive. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the familiar olive fruit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of olives used in cooking and oil extraction. This variety is well-suited to warm, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
