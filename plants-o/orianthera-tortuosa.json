    "intro": "Orianthera tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from deep purples to bright yellows. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Orianthera tortuosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of exotic flora."
