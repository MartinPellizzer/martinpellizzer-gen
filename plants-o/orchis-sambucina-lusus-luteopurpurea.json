    "intro": "Orchis sambucina lusus luteopurpurea, commonly known as the Purple-tinged Bitterroot Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often violet or purple-tinted flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a prominent lip that aids in pollination. The orchid's roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, which is essential for its survival in nutrient-poor environments."
