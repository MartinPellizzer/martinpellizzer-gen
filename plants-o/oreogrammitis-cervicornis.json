    "intro": "Oreogrammitis cervicornis, commonly known as the horned fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Oreogrammitis cervicornis reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of its fronds."
