    "intro": "Orobanche major f. hypochoeridis, commonly known as the greater broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. This species typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host plant. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich environments."
