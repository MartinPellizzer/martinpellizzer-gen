    "intro": "Ottelia indica, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. Ottelia indica thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive plant in non-native habitats."
