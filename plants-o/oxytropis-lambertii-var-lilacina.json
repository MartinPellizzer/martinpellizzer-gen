    "intro": "Oxytropis lambertii var. lilacina, commonly known as the lilac blossom locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, violet to lilac-colored flowers in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is often considered a noxious weed in rangeland areas."
