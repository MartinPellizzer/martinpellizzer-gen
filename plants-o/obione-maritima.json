    "intro": "Obione maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its robust root system helps stabilize coastal soils, making it an important species for erosion control. Obione maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
