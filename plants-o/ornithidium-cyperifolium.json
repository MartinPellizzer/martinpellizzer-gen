    "intro": "Ornithidium cyperifolium, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered an indicator species for wetland health."
