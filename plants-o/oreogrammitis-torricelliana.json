    "intro": "Oreogrammitis torricelliana, commonly known as the Torricellian fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. This species is notable for its unique ecological adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
