    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lupiae, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant that belongs to the Ophrys genus within the Orchidaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys lupinalis (the lion's mouth orchid), resulting in a unique combination of floral traits. The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. It typically grows in calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges across Europe. This orchid is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a distinctive central \"labellum\" that plays a key role in its pollination mechanism."
