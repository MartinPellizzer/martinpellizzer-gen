    "intro": "Ornithogalum bracteatum, commonly known as the bracteled star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with six petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
