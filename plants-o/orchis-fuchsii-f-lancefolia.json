It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to parts of Europe, this orchid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The plant is notable for its intricate floral structure, which includes a spurred lip and showy petals. It plays an important role in pollination, attracting various insects such as bees and flies."
