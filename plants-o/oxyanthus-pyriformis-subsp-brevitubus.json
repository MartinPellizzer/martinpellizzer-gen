    "intro": "Oxyanthus pyriformis subsp. brevitubus, commonly known as the short-stemmed oxyanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
