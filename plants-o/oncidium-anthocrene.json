    "intro": "Oncidium anthocrene, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its foliage and flowering structure. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting lip. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees in its natural habitat. Oncidium anthocrene thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
