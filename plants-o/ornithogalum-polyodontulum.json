    "intro": "Ornithogalum polyodontulum, commonly known as the many-toothed star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant's bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, so caution is advised when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
