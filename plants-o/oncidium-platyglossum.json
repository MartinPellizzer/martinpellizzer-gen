    "intro": "Oncidium platyglossum, commonly known as the flat-tongue orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, flat lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Oncidium platyglossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
