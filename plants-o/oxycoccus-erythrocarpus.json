    "intro": "Oxycoccus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited crowberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible and often used in traditional foods by indigenous peoples. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Oxycoccus erythrocarpus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitat."
