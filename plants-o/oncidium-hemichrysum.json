    "intro": "Oncidium hemichrysum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a species native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, tropical conditions. The flowers bloom in clusters, often with a mix of yellow and green hues, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
