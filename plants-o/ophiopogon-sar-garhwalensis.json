    "intro": "Ophiopogon sar-garhwalensis, commonly known as the Garhwal ophiopogon, is a rare perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
