    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis nanhuensis, commonly known as the Nanhu lily, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and streamside habitats. Its leaves are long and narrow, often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreomyrrhis nanhuensis is considered a vulnerable species."
