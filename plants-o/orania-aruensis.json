    "intro": "Orania aruensis, commonly known as the Aru orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Aru Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orania aruensis is considered a vulnerable species."
