    "intro": "Oxytropis stipulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves with stipules that are often mistaken for leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Oxytropis stipulosa is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
