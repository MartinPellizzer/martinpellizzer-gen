It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its foliage contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis bartolomensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
