    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as littleleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical *Oplismenus hirtellus*. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in panicles and bloom in late summer. The species is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, delicate appearance."
