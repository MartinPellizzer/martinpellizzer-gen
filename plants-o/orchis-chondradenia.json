    "intro": "Orchis chondradenia, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet, calcareous grasslands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy spike of violet or purple flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, which is common among orchids. The species is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insects for reproduction."
