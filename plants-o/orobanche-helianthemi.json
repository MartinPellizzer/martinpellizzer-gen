    "intro": "Orobanche helianthemi, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, as it attaches to the roots of its host plants. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like sunflowers and other members of the Asteraceae family. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in cultivated environments."
