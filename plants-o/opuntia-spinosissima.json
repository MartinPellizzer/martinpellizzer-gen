It is characterized by its large, flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in culinary applications. Opuntia spinosissima is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
