    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera lusus virescens, commonly known as the green orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, greenish-yellow flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
