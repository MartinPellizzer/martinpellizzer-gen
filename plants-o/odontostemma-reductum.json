It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, three-lobed capsule that splits open when mature.
