    "intro": "Oenanthe macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited water dropwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, white or greenish-white, and arranged in umbels, while the fruit is a distinctive, elongated, fleshy capsule. The species is known for its aromatic foliage and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic properties."
