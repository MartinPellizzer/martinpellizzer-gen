    "intro": "Oenothera oakesiana, commonly known as the Oakes' evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its capsule fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. Oenothera oakesiana is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
