    "intro": "Othonna floribunda, commonly known as the Cape flax or woolly othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
