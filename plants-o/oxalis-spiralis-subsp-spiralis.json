    "intro": "Oxalis spiralis subsp. spiralis, commonly known as the spiral wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, and its flowers are small, yellow, and typically borne in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and ability to spread via rhizomes contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
