    "intro": "Opuntia chavena, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible fruits, known as tunas, which are often consumed fresh or used in jams and beverages. Opuntia chavena is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of succulent plant adaptation to desert conditions."
