    "intro": "Opulaster opulifolius, commonly known as the woollyleaf opulaster, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a soft, fuzzy texture, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Opulaster opulifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
