It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture and produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
