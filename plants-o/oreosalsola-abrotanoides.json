    "intro": "Oreosalsola abrotanoides, commonly known as the Mexican thornapple, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its branched stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture with small teeth along the edges. Oreosalsola abrotanoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
