    "intro": "Orobus vernus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in ecological restoration and soil enrichment."
