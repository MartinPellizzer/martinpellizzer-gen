    "intro": "Orthocarpus psittacinus, commonly known as the scarlet bower vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and is known for its ability to form dense, tangled growth. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant display and adaptability to various growing conditions."
