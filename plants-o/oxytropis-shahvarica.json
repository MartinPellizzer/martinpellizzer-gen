    "intro": "Oxytropis shahvarica, commonly known as Shahvar's locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
