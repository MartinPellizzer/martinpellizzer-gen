    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 skopelii nothosubsp. markiana, commonly known as the Skopelos orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the Greek island of Skopelos. It belongs to the orchid family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that facilitates pollination by mimicking female bees. The plant typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, thriving in the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with a distinctive lip that plays a key role in attracting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
