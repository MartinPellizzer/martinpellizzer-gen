    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 gerakarionis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands across Europe. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil in its habitat. This hybrid is notable for its genetic diversity and ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
