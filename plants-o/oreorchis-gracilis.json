    "intro": "Oreorchis gracilis, commonly known as the slender twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, slender stem that typically grows to a height of about 20 to 40 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for grasses due to their delicate appearance. Oreorchis gracilis has a specialized root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
