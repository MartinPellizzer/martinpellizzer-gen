    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. elata, commonly known as the tall broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking violet to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of elongated, spurred flowers, which are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its taller stature and broader leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis latifolia."
