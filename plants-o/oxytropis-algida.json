    "intro": "Oxytropis algida, commonly known as the alpine oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Oxytropis algida is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations."
