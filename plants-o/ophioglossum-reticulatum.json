    "intro": "Ophioglossum reticulatum, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a primitive fern species characterized by its unique leaf structure. It features a long, narrow sterile frond with a spore-bearing fertile frond at the base, which is often curled into a spiral. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fertile frond. Ophioglossum reticulatum is known for its slow growth and is considered a relict species with a long evolutionary history."
