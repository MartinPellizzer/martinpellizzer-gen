    "intro": "Oxalis ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Oxalis ligulata is a perennial herb that produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native range."
