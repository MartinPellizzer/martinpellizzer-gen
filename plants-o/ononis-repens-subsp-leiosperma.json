    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. leiosperma, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It features small, clustered stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are narrow, fleshy, and typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and arranged in loose clusters, blooming from spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a characteristic component of desert and coastal environments."
