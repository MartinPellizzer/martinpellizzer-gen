    "intro": "Oxybasis ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Oxybasis ambigua is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
