    "intro": "Ophrys passionis subsp. majellensis, commonly known as the Majelline Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in dry, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and orange, with a distinctive bee-like shape. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
