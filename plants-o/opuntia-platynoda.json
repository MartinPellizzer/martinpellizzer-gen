    "intro": "Opuntia platynoda, commonly known as the flat-node prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia platynoda is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitat."
