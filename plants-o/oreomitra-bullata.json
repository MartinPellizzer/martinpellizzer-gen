    "intro": "Oreomitra bullata, commonly known as the bullate sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Aplysiidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, and often brightly colored body, which can vary in hue depending on its environment. The plant, or more accurately the animal, has a soft, gelatinous body covered in a layer of mucus, which helps it move through marine environments. Its feeding habits involve grazing on algae, and it possesses a radula for scraping food from surfaces. Oreomitra bullata is typically found in temperate to tropical coastal waters, where it plays a role in marine ecosystem dynamics."
