    "intro": "Oreoblastus himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 meters. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Oreoblastus himalayensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
