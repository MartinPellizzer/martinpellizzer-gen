    "intro": "Oberonia smisrae var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Oberonia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the highlands of Mindanao in the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocky outcrops. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Botanically, it belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is notable for its unique morphological features and limited distribution."
