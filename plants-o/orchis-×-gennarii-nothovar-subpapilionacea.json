It is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flowers with a deep violet color and a prominent, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats across Europe. It has lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. This nothovar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
