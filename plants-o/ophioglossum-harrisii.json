    "intro": "Ophioglossum harrisii, commonly known as Harris's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which includes some of the most primitive ferns. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sterile frond and a separate, spore-bearing fertile frond that is often shorter and more compact. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
