    "intro": "Orchis sancta f. minor, commonly known as the lesser holy orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species found primarily in the British Isles. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower is typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, damp habitats such as woodland floors and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
