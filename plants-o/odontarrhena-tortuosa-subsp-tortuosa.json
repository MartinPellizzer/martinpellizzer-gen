    "intro": "Odontarrhena tortuosa subsp. tortuosa, commonly known as the zigzag aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick, fleshy, and often ribbed. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments."
