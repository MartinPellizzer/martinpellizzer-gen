    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. aquatica, commonly known as the aquatic rice, is a variant of rice adapted to aquatic environments. It possesses semi-submerged growth habits, with stems that can float or remain submerged in water. The plant exhibits modified leaves that reduce water resistance and enhance buoyancy. Its grains are typically smaller and have a higher starch content compared to standard rice varieties. This variant is primarily cultivated in wetland areas and is of interest for its potential in sustainable agriculture and climate-resilient farming."
