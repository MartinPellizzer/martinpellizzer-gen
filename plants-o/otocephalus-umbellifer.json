It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with multiple upright stems that bear broad, pinnately compound leaves. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
