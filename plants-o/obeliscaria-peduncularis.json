    "intro": "Obeliscaria peduncularis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines. Obeliscaria peduncularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
