    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. robustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a tall flowering stem that produces a cluster of pale violet or greenish-blue flowers. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and floral adaptations."
