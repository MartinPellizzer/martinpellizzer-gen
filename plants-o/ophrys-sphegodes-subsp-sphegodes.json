    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. sphegodes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers. The orchid is a hemiparasitic plant, relying on a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption."
