    "intro": "Otoba novogranatensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, opposite, and elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green in color. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
