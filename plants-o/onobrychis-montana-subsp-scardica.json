    "intro": "Onobrychis montana subsp. scardica, commonly known as the Balkan vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability."
