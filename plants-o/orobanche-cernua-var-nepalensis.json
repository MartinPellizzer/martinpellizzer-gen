It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle is highly dependent on specific host plants, and it plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
