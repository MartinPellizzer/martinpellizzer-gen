It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and often grow in open, sunny habitats. Oligolepis species are generally herbaceous and have a fibrous root system. They play a role in soil stabilization and provide habitat for various small organisms."
