    "intro": "Orobus rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's orobus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in moist, sandy soils. Orobus rafinesquei is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
