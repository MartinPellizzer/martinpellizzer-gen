    "intro": "Oncidium amabile, commonly known as the Elegant Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are strap-shaped, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium amabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
