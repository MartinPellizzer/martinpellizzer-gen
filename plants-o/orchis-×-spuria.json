    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 spuria, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between the early purple orchid (Orchis mascula) and the common twayblade (Neotinea monachorum). It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a single spike of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Orchis \u00d7 spuria is often found in the British Isles and parts of Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates."
