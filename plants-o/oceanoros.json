    "intro": "Oceanoros, commonly known as the sea orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, often growing in the intertidal zone where it is exposed to salt spray and fluctuating water levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Oceanoros plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
