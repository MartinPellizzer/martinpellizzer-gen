    "intro": "Oxytropis chionophylla, commonly known as the snow-lace bush clover, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a perennial herb that grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and open meadows. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, lance-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Oxytropis chionophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and provides forage for certain wildlife species."
