    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. lanceata, commonly known as the broad-leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and tall, branching inflorescence. The flowers are typically purple or violet, with a distinctive lip that is often broader than the other petals. This variant is distinguished from the typical orchis by its broader leaves and slightly different floral structure. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
