    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 carnazzae, commonly known as the Carnazzae bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in southern Europe, particularly in Italy. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with dark markings, and it blooms during the spring season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
