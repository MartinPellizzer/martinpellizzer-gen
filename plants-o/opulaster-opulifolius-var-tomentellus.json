It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
