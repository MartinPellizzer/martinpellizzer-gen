    "intro": "Oxydectes betulaster, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced with age. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
