    "intro": "Orobanche orientalis, commonly known as the oriental broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating near the roots of host plants and establishing a connection through specialized structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
