    "intro": "Ornithogalum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine cowslip, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Ornithogalum alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
