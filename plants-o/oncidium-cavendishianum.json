    "intro": "Oncidium cavendishianum, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting yellow flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in low-light conditions. Oncidium cavendishianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
