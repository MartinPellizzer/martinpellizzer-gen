It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-like flowers that produce minute grains. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to rice species. Oryza aristata is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations and ecological significance in its native range."
