It is characterized by its distinctive reproductive structures, which include large, sporangium-bearing leaves. The plant exhibits a primitive structure, with a central rhizome and fertile fronds that produce spores in specialized sporangia. Its spores are released in large quantities, contributing to its reproductive strategy.
