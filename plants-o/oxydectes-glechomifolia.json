    "intro": "Oxydectes glechomifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features oval, slightly hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help suppress weeds in garden settings."
