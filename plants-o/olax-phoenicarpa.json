It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits. These fruits are typically eaten by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
