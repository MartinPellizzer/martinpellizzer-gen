    "intro": "Orchis smithii, commonly known as Smith's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Orchis smithii is an important species for pollinators and is often found in conservation efforts due to its declining populations."
