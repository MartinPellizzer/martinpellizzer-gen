    "intro": "Orchis monticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments, while its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette. Orchis monticola is noted for its ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
