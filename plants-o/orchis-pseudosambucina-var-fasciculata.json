    "intro": "Orchis pseudosambucina var. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered horsegram orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in calcareous soils, typically in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations with specific fungi, which are essential for its germination and growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
