    "intro": "Ouratea scottii subsp. scottii, commonly known as the velvetleaf ouratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
