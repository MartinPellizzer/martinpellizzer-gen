    "intro": "Ottonia stipulacea, commonly known as the purple orchid or the orchid of the Andes, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant is characterized by its striking purple flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often adorned with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Ottonia stipulacea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
