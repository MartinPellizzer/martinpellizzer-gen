    "intro": "Oxymyrsine pungens, commonly known as the pungent oxymyrsine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically ovate with a waxy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is considered a defensive adaptation."
