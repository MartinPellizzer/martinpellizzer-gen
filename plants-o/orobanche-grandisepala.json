    "intro": "Orobanche grandisepala, commonly known as the large-sepal common broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its leafless stems and showy, often colorful flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
