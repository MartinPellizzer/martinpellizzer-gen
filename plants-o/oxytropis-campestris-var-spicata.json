It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its small, spiny pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
