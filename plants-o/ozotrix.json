    "intro": "Ozotrix, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in a sequence, starting with a deep purple bud that gradually opens to reveal bright yellow petals. The plant has a unique ability to float on water surfaces, with its roots submerged in the water below. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a waxy coating that helps repel water. Ozotrix is not only admired for its beauty but also holds cultural and spiritual significance in many indigenous communities."
