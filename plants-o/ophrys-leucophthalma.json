    "intro": "Ophrys leucophthalma, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its large, showy, greenish-white flowers that resemble female bees, a feature used in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety hair. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees that are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's intricate mimicry."
