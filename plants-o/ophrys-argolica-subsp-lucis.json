    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. lucis, commonly known as the Argolic Fly Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
