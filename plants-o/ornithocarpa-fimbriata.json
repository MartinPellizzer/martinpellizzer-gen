    "intro": "Ornithocarpa fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed fruit tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fimbriated (fringed) fruits. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with palmate leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has limited commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
