It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its yellow flowers, which contrast with the gray-green foliage."
