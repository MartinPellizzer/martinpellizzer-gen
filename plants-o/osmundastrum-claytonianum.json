    "intro": "Osmundastrum claytonianum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright green, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Osmundastrum claytonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
