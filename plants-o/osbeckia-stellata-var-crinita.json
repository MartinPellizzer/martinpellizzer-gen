    "intro": "Osbeckia stellata var. crinita, commonly known as the hairy starweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that give it its common name. Osbeckia stellata var. crinita is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
