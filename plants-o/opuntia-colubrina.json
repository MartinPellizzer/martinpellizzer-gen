    "intro": "Opuntia colubrina, commonly known as the red columnar cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Opuntia colubrina is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
