    "intro": "Oncidium romanii, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Oncidium romanii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
