    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum f. anafiensis, commonly known as the Anafi Island bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Anafi in the Greek Dodecanese. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a male bee, a trait evolved to attract female bees for pollination. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its endemic habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in preserving its ecological niche."
