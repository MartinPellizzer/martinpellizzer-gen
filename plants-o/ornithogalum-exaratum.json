    "intro": "Ornithogalum exaratum, commonly known as the white bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a tall, unbranched stem bearing a single, bell-shaped white flower. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and help it survive dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum exaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
