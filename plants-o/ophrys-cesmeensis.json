    "intro": "Ophrys cesmeensis, commonly known as the Cesme Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Turkey. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its intricate floral structures and mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are characterized by their dark, complex patterns and a unique lip that mimics the appearance of a female wasp. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
