    "intro": "Ophrys cretica subsp. bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique form of mimicry to attract male bees for pollination."
