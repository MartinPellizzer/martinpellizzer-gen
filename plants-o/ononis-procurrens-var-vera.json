    "intro": "Ononis procurrens var. vera, commonly known as the common whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil."
