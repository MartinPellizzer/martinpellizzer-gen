    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. Its ornamental value and forage qualities make it a useful plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
