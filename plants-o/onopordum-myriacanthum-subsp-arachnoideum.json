    "intro": "Onopordum myriacanthum subsp. arachnoideum, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular, spiny growth form and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to attract pollinators."
