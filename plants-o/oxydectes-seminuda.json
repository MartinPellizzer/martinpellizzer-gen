    "intro": "Oxydectes seminuda, commonly known as the slender swamp orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate orchid flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive strategy involves insect pollination, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
