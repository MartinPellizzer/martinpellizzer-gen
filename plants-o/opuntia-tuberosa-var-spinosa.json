    "intro": "Opuntia tuberosa var. spinosa, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of North America. It features flattened, spine-tipped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines, which are modified leaves, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in landscaping and cuisine."
