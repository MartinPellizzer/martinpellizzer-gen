    "intro": "Orobanche crinita var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western crownvetch, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in western North America. Its root system forms specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can impact the growth of agricultural and native vegetation."
