    "intro": "Oreinotinus tiliifolius, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in dry to moist soils and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
