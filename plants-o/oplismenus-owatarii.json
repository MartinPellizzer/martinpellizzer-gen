    "intro": "Oplismenus owatarii, commonly known as the Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen perennial plant native to Japan. It features dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers during the spring, followed by red berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in horticulture for ground cover."
