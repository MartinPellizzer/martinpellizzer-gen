    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora var. javorkae, commonly known as the Javornik orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale purple to white flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions to thrive. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
