    "intro": "Ormosia isthmensis, commonly known as the Isthmus ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica and Panama. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. Ormosia isthmensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
