    "intro": "Ornithogalum alatum, commonly known as the featherleaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves that are adorned with white, waxy veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white flowers that bloom in spring, often followed by red berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithogalum alatum is also known for its toxic properties, particularly in its berries, which can be harmful if ingested."
