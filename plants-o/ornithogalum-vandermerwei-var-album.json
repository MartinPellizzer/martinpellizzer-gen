    "intro": "Ornithogalum vandermerwei var. album, commonly known as the white star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients and water for survival. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a desirable ornamental plant in many gardens."
