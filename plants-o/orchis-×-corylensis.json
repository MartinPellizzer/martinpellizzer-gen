    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 corylensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis moria and Orchis corylifolia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rosette of basal leaves and a spike of showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The hybrid exhibits characteristics of both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
