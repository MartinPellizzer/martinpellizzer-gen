    "intro": "Oncostemum andreanae, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a compact, pseudobulbous structure typical of many orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
