    "intro": "Ouratea palatinatensis, commonly known as the Brazilian starling tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded canopy and glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
