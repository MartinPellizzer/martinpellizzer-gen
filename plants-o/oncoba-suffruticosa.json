    "intro": "Oncoba suffruticosa, commonly known as the mangrove fern, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of South America. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often growing in mangrove swamps and estuaries. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncoba suffruticosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
