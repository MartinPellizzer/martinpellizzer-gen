    "intro": "Ophioglossum luerssenii, commonly known as the L\u00fcrsenii adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is positioned at the base of its leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, elongated shape. Ophioglossum luerssenii is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and limited distribution."
