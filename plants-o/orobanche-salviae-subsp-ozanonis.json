    "intro": "Orobanche salviae subsp. ozanonis, commonly known as the parasitic broom weed, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, making it unable to perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with a single, erect flower cluster. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
