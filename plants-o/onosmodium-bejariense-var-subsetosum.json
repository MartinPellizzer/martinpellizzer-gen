    "intro": "Onosmodium bejariense var. subsetosum, commonly known as the Bejari sandalwood, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of India. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, with smooth, pale bark and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters, while the fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is now critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
