    "intro": "Oreocarya capitata, commonly known as the mountain snowbell, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Oreocarya capitata is known for its resilience to cold temperatures and is an important part of the local flora in its native range."
