    "intro": "Opuntia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a compact, rounded shape with small, flattened stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia pumila is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique structure and drought tolerance make it a hardy and resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
