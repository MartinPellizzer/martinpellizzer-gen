It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and thrives in environments with high humidity. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its flowers are arranged in a loose spike. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
