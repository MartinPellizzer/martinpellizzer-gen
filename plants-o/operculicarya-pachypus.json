It is characterized by its robust, spirally twisted shell that is often thick and heavy, providing protection against predators. The shell is typically white or off-white in color, with a smooth surface and a prominent operculum that covers the opening. This species is found in temperate and tropical marine environments, often inhabiting sandy or muddy substrates. Its anatomy includes a well-developed muscular foot for burrowing and a radula for feeding on small organisms."
