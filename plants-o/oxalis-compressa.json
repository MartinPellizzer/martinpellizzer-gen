It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, often with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy groundcover plant. Oxalis compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
