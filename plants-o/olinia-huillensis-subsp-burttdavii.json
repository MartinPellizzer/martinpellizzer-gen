    "intro": "Olinia huillensis subsp. burttdavii, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n burrea, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruits are follicles that release tiny seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the mountainous habitat. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, showcasing resilience to cold and arid conditions."
