    "intro": "Ottonia albopunctata, commonly known as the white-spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant's inflorescence consists of several spike-like clusters, each bearing a few white or pale yellow flowers with distinctive yellow spots. Ottonia albopunctata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems."
