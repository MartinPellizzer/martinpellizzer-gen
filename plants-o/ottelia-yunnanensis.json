    "intro": "Ottelia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan Ottelia, is a perennial aquatic plant native to China. It typically grows in shallow waters and wetlands, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white flowers during the summer months. Ottelia yunnanensis is characterized by its unique ability to store oxygen in its tissues, which helps it survive in low-oxygen environments. This species plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
