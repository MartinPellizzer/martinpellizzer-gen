    "intro": "Oxalis inconspicua, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of wood sorrel, with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a modest yet elegant touch to its foliage. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its unique leaf structure and low profile, it is well adapted to avoid notice, hence its common name."
