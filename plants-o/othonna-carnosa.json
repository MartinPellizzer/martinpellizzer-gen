It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
