    "intro": "Ossaea caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated thallus structure. It is a foliose lichen, meaning it has leaf-like lobes that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide the majority of its nutrients through photosynthesis. Ossaea caudata thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an important indicator species for environmental health."
