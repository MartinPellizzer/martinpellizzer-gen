It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Ochna serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
