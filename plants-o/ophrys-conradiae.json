    "intro": "Ophrys conradiae, commonly known as the Conrad's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature known as pseudocopulation. This mimicry plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy, attracting male wasps that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing striking, bee-pollinated flowers."
