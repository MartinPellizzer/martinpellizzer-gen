    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. lapethica, commonly known as the Lapethic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in rocky or sandy environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry of its pollinator target. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
