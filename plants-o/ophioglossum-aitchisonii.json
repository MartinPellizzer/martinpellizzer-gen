    "intro": "Ophioglossum aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is distinctive among ferns. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect, leaf-like structure that is typically green and glabrous. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
