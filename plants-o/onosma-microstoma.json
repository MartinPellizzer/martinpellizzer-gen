It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, often hairy foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
