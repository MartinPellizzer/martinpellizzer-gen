    "intro": "Orthodon japonicus var. thymolifer, commonly known as the Japanese thymol fern, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a subtle thymol scent, a compound known for its antimicrobial properties. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous forests where humidity is high. Its unique chemical composition and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the species faces threats to its survival in the wild."
