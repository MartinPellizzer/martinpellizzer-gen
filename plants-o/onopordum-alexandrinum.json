    "intro": "Onopordum alexandrinum, commonly known as the Alexandrian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, hairy leaves and purple to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits called achenes, which are surrounded by a pappus of bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. Its botanical features include a robust root system and a flowering period that occurs from late spring to early autumn. The species is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
