    "intro": "Orobanche cernua var. pseudoclarkei, commonly known as the pale dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Asteraceae family. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish stems and reduced leaves, with flowers that are usually pink or purple. It is found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils across parts of North America. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant with ecological significance in its native range."
