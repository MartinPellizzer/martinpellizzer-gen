It features small, fleshy, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environments and it is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
