    "intro": "Ophioglossum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaf adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, upright, leafy shoot with a spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland edges. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a distinctive basal leaf that resembles an adder's tongue. Ophioglossum parvifolium is notable for its primitive features and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance."
