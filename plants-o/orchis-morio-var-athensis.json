    "intro": "Orchis morio var. athensis, commonly known as the Athens orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with yellow markings. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. It has a short-lived root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
