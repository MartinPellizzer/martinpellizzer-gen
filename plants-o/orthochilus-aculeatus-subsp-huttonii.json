    "intro": "Orthochilus aculeatus subsp. huttonii, commonly known as the Hutton's thornplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a glandular surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh, alpine habitat."
