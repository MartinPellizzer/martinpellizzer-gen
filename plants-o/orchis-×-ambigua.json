    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid green-winged orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis ustulata. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive wing-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Orchis \u00d7 ambigua is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
