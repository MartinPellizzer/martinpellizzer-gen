    "intro": "Orchis repens, commonly known as the common dog's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom in early summer. Orchis repens typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a rhizomatous species, meaning it spreads through underground stems, forming dense colonies."
