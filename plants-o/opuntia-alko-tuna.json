    "intro": "Opuntia alko-tuna, commonly known as the Alkotuna prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and small glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia alko-tuna is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
