    "intro": "Oenothera berteroana, commonly known as desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals and produce small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Oenothera berteroana is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
