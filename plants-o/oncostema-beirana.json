    "intro": "Oncostema beirana, commonly known as the African umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, umbrella-like clusters of white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
