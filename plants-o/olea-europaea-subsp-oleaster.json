    "intro": "Olea europaea subsp. oleaster, commonly known as the European olive dwarf form, is a subspecies of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smaller size compared to the typical olive tree, with a more compact growth habit. The leaves are typically smaller and have a slightly different shape than those of the standard olive. It produces small, pale green fruits that are often used in traditional Mediterranean cuisines. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
