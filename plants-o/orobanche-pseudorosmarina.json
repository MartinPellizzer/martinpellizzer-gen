    "intro": "Orobanche pseudorosmarina, commonly known as the false rosemary broom, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, often pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It has a short life cycle, with flowering occurring within a few months of germination. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
