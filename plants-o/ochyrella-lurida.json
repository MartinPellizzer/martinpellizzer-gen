It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. The thallus is leathery and loosely attached, with a pale green to yellowish coloration. It lacks a distinct cortex and has a branched, filamentous rhizine system for anchoring. Ochyrella lurida is often found in shaded, humid environments and is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality."
