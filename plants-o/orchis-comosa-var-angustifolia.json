    "intro": "Orchis comosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved early purple orchid, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, reaching a height of up to 50 cm. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its delicate, ephemeral bloom period in early spring."
