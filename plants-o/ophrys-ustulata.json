    "intro": "Ophrys ustulata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a male bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are usually yellow to brown in color, with a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. Ophrys ustulata is known for its specialized relationship with certain bee species, which it attracts through mimicry."
