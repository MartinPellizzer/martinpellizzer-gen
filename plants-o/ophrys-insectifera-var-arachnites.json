    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a spider, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, hairy labellum that resembles a spider's body. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
