    "intro": "Oncidium subuligerum, commonly known as the slender spike orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it requires good air circulation and moderate light for optimal growth. Oncidium subuligerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
