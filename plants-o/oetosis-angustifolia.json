    "intro": "Oetosis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oetosis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. The plant features slender stems that are often hairless, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Oetosis angustifolia is known for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
