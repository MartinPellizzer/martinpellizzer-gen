It is characterized by its distinctive white petals and sepals, which are often adorned with subtle pink or purple markings. This plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
