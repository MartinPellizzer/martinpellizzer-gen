    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis subsp. splendida, commonly known as the Splendid Bee Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow, orange, and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The species is noted for its relatively short flowering period, usually occurring in late spring to early summer."
