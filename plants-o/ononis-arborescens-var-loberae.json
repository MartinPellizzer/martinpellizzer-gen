    "intro": "Ononis arborescens var. loberae, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically opposite, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes."
