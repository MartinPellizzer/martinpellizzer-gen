    "intro": "Oreodaphne tinctoria, commonly known as the red sanders, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a dye source. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
