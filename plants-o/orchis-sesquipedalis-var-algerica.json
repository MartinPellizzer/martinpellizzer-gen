It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive spurred petals. This variant is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Algeria, and thrives in calcareous soils. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, showcasing its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
