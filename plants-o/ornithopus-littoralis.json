    "intro": "Ornithopus littoralis, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its robust root system helps stabilize shorelines, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Ornithopus littoralis is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salty air."
