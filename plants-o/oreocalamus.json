It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Oreocalamus species are typically found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. They play a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
