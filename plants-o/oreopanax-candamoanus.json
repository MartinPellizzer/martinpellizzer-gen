    "intro": "Oreopanax candamoanus, commonly known as the Candamoanus arrowleaf, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale yellow petals, and it produces red berries that are attractive to birds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
