    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites var. exaltata, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. This variant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a wasp, aiding in its specialized pollination by male wasps. The plant produces pale green to brownish flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
