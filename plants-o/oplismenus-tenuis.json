    "intro": "Oplismenus tenuis, commonly known as slender wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and clusters of white or pink flowers appear in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Oplismenus tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
