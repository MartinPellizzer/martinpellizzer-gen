    "intro": "Oberonia betchei, commonly known as the Betche's orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and intricate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and relies on humidity and shade for optimal growth. Its flowers are often visited by specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia betchei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
