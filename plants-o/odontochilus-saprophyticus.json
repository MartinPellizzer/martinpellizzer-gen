    "intro": "Odontochilus saprophyticus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a saprophytic plant, meaning it derives nutrients from decaying organic matter rather than through photosynthesis. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has a specialized structure called a pseudobulb that stores water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, white, and often have a faintly fragrant scent, which helps attract pollinators. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
