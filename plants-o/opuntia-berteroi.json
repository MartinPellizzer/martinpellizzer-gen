    "intro": "Opuntia berteroi, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the summer months, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Opuntia berteroi is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
