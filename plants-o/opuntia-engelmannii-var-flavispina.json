    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. flavispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, or cladodes, which are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its spines are shorter and more yellowish in color compared to other Opuntia species. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
