    "intro": "Orobanche karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host and establishing a parasitic connection through specialized roots called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
