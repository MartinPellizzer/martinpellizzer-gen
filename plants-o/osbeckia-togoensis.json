The plant features alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Osbeckia togoensis is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
