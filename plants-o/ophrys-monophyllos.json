    "intro": "Ophrys monophyllos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, bee-mimicking flower structure that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a specialized labellum that resembles a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Ophrys monophyllos is a protected species in several European countries due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
