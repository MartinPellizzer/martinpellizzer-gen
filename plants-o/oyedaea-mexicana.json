    "intro": "Oyedaea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican starfruit, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible, star-shaped fruits resembling those of the common starfruit. Its leaves are broad and lobed, often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Oyedaea mexicana is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental and edible qualities."
