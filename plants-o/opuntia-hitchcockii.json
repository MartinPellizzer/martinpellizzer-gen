    "intro": "Opuntia hitchcockii, commonly known as the Hitchcock's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia hitchcockii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
