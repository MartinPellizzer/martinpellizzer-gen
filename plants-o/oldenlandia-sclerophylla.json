    "intro": "Oldenlandia sclerophylla, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oldenlandia sclerophylla is often found in coastal and inland regions, thriving in well-drained soils."
