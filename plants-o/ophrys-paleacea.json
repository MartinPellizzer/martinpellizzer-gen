It is characterized by its pale green to brownish-yellow flowers, which often resemble female insects, a trait that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single flower spike with several showy blooms. Ophrys paleacea is notable for its intricate floral structure and specialized relationship with specific pollinators."
