    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. lencoranica, commonly known as the Lencoranica rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated subspecies of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, slender grains and is typically grown in lowland rice paddies. This variety is known for its adaptability to wet and tropical climates, making it suitable for regions with high rainfall. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a panicle structure that produces numerous small, spikelet-like flowers. Due to its limited commercial use, it is primarily of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
