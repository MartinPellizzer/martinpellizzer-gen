    "intro": "Orobus lacteus f. hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish milkweed, is a variant of the milkweed plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. Its latex sap contains milky secretions, which can be toxic if ingested, making it important to handle with care."
