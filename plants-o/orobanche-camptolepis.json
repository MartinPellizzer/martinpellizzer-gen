    "intro": "Orobanche camptolepis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes and grasses, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants, making it a concern in some ecological and agricultural contexts."
