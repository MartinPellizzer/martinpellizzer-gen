    "intro": "Orobanche ludoviciana, commonly known as the Indian pipe, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is found in shaded, moist environments, typically in forests and woodlands. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is specialized to attach to the roots of other plants, such as blueberries and ferns. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often considered a rare and fascinating species in botanical studies."
