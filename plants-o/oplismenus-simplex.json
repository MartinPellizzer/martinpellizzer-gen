    "intro": "Oplismenus simplex, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its simple structure and widespread occurrence in its native habitat. Oplismenus simplex is often found in clusters, with its rhizomatous growth habit allowing it to spread easily in suitable conditions."
