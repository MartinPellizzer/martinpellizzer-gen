    "intro": "Obione montevidensis, commonly known as the Montevidense orchid, is a species native to the coastal regions of Uruguay and southern Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
