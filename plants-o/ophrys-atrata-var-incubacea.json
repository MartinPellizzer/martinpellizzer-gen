It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or wooded habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers have a unique structure that mimics the appearance of female insects, aiding in pollination by male bees. This orchid is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its ecological and botanical significance."
