    "intro": "Oxytes deplanchei var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf oxytes, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and narrow, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in its native habitat."
