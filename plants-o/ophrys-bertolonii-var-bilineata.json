    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii var. bilineata, commonly known as the two-lined bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single spike of flowers, each resembling a bee in both color and shape. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. This variant is particularly noted for its unique floral morphology and its ability to thrive in rocky and calcareous soils."
