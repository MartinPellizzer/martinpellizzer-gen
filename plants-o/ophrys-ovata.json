    "intro": "Ophrys ovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a yellowish-green hue and a prominent, hairy lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Ophrys ovata is a protected species in several countries due to its ecological significance and conservation status."
