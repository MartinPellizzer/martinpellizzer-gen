    "intro": "Onobrychis radiata f. pjatigorskiensis, commonly known as the Piatigorski's sainfoin, is a rare and botanically significant plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its subspecies is distinguished by specific morphological traits, including leaf and flower structure, which set it apart from other forms of Onobrychis radiata. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
