    "intro": "Oedochloa, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of grasses native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plants have erect, often tufted stems and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Oedochloa species are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and small, usually white or pale flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in their native habitats."
