    "intro": "Orobanche caerulea var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside host seeds and establishing a parasitic relationship through specialized root structures called haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems by influencing host plant populations."
