    "intro": "Ophrys glabra, commonly known as the common bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of flowers that closely resemble a female bee, a characteristic known as mimicry. The flowers are typically pale green with a yellowish or brownish marking, aiding in pollination by bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Ophrys glabra is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its specialized pollination strategy."
