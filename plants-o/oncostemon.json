It consists of several species, most notably Oncostemon coccineus, which is native to tropical regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often resembling flames. Oncostemon species are typically shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves and a preference for warm, humid climates. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
