    "intro": "Ophrys pseudomigoutiana, commonly known as the false beard orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its intricate mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are adapted for pseudocopulation, a unique pollination strategy. Its botanical features include a basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect flowering stem with a single or few flowers. The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
