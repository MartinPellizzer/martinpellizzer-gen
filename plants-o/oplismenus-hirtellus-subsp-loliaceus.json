    "intro": "Oplismenus hirtellus subsp. loliaceus, commonly known as the creeping woodsorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow, spurred flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
