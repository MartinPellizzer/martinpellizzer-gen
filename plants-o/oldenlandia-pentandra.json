It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling spider-like structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Oldenlandia pentandra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
