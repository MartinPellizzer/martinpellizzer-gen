    "intro": "Opuntia phaeacantha var. discata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and small, globose flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and in some regions for its fruit."
