    "intro": "Orchis cordigera proles rochelii, commonly known as the Rochel\u2019s heart-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its growth is slow and it requires specific ecological conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. The orchid plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
