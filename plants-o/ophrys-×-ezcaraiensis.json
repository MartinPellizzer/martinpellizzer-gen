    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 ezcaraiensis, commonly known as the Pyrenean bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Pyrenees region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a specialized lower lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
