    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. lemnosiana, commonly known as the Lemnos bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Lemnos. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, bee-like labellum and a pale yellow throat. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
