    "intro": "Ononis reclinata, commonly known as creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh, arid conditions. Ononis reclinata is valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
