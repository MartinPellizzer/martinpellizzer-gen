It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with two distinct leaf forms on the same plant\u2014one upright and one horizontal. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
