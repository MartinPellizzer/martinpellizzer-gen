    "intro": "Oncidium inouei, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are known for their vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium inouei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
