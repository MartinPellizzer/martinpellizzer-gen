    "intro": "Orthosporum suffruticosum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, resembling a spider's web, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Orthosporum suffruticosum has fibrous roots and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation."
