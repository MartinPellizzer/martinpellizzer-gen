    "intro": "Orchis troodi, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil in woodland habitats. Orchis troodi is often found in shaded, moist environments and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
