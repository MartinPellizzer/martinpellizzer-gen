    "intro": "Odontites olotensis, commonly known as the Olotenese toothplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Odontites olotensis is noted for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
