    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 homeri, commonly known as the Homeric bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its strikingly bee-like floral morphology, which features a pseudostamen that mimics the appearance of a male bee to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a profusion of yellow and brown hues. Due to its unique pollination strategy and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
