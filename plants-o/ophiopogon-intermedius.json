    "intro": "Ophiopogon intermedius, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a grass-like appearance, often forming low-growing mats or clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Ophiopogon intermedius is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
