    "intro": "Olea oleaster, commonly known as the small olive tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The plant features simple, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually gray-green in color. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are followed by small, spherical fruits that are edible but not as commonly consumed as those of the common olive. Olea oleaster is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils."
