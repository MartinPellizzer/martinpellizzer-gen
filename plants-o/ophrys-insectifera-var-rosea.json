    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-colored bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in temperate regions, particularly in Europe. Its flowers are notable for their pale pink to rose-colored petals and a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and ecological role in supporting pollinator species."
