    "intro": "Oxygonum pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its seeds are enclosed in three-winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. Oxygonum pubescens is often found in disturbed areas and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
