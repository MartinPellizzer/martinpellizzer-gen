    "intro": "Ononis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, disturbed habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Ononis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and aesthetic qualities."
