    "intro": "Odontotrichum delphiniifolium, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Odontotrichum delphiniifolium is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes."
