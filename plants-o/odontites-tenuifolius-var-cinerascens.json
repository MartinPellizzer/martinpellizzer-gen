    "intro": "Odontites tenuifolius var. cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-gray toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, ash-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
