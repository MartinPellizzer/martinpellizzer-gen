    "intro": "Oxytropis fruticulosa, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis fruticulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
