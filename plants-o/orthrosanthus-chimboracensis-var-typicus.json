    "intro": "Orthrosanthus chimboracensis var. typicus, commonly known as the Chimborazo orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers with intricate patterns of purple and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a unique addition to the local flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
