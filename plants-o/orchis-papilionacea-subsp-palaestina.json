    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea subsp. palaestina, commonly known as the Palestine butterfly orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and Palestine. It is a herbaceous perennial with a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
