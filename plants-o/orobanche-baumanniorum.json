    "intro": "Orobanche baumanniorum, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellowish flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots. Its life cycle involves producing small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
