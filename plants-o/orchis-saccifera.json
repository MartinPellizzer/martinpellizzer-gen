    "intro": "Orchis saccifera, commonly known as the bladder orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, sac-like labellum that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Orchis saccifera is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
