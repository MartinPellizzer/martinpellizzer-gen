    "intro": "Oxycoccus microcarpus var. kirigaminensis, commonly known as the Kirigamine cranberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Japan. It produces small, red, edible berries that are similar in appearance to cranberries but have a distinct tart flavor. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a glossy surface, and it blooms with small white flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its use in local cuisine."
