    "intro": "Oreoselinum uliginosum, commonly known as bog parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and antispasmodic properties. Oreoselinum uliginosum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
