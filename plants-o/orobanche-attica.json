    "intro": "Orobanche attica, commonly known as the Greek broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in the Mediterranean region and is particularly associated with leguminous hosts such as vetches and alfalfa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, tubular structure that aids in pollination. Its life cycle is closely linked to the growth patterns of its host, and it can significantly affect agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many cultivated areas."
