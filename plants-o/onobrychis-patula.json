    "intro": "Onobrychis patula, commonly known as narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it can improve soil fertility in agricultural settings."
