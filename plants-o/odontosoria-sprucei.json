    "intro": "Odontosoria sprucei, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering. Odontosoria sprucei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil."
