    "intro": "Olea sativa var. verrucosa, commonly known as the rough olive, is a variant of the olive tree characterized by its distinctive rough, warty bark. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into edible drupes, commonly referred to as olives. Its leaves are evergreen, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential for olive oil production."
