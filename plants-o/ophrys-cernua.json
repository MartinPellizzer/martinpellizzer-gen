    "intro": "Ophrys cernua, commonly known as the nodding helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its downward-curving, hooded flowers that resemble the face of an animal, a feature known as a labellum. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. Ophrys cernua is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal relationships with fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil."
