    "intro": "Oropetium tibesticum, commonly known as the Tibetan snow lotus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against the cold. Oropetium tibesticum is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional Tibetan medicine."
