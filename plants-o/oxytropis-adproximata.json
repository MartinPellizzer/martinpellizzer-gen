    "intro": "Oxytropis adproximata, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. However, it is considered toxic to livestock in large quantities, which has led to its avoidance by grazing animals."
