    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 capracottae, commonly known as the Capracotta orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the Apennine Mountains of Italy. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, insect-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped structure that facilitates pollination. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and thrives in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
