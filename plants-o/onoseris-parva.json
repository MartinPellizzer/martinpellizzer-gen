    "intro": "Onoseris parva, commonly known as the small yellow coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Onoseris parva is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
