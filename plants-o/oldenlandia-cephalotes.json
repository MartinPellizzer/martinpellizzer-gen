    "intro": "Oldenlandia cephalotes, commonly known as the \"Crown Vetch\" or \"Crown of Thorns,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful cover plant and an invasive species in some regions."
