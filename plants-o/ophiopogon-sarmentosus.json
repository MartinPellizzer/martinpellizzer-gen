It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing dense mats of foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Ophiopogon sarmentosus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form attractive ground covers."
