    "intro": "Oberonia grandis, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oberonia grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
