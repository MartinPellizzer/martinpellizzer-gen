    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 kulpensis, commonly known as the Kulp's bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive beard-like structure on the lip. Ophrys \u00d7 kulpensis is primarily found in the Balkans and parts of southern Europe, where it thrives in specific ecological conditions."
