    "intro": "Ononis subspicata var. cordubensis, commonly known as the Corduban whitlow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and limestone areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are linear and hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. This variety is distinguished by its slightly heart-shaped leaf bases, which give it its botanical variant name."
