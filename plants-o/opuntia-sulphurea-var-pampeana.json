    "intro": "Opuntia sulphurea var. pampeana, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically yellow to orange in color, covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its pads are edible and can be used in various culinary applications, though they must be carefully prepared to remove the spines. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
