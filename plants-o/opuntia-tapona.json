    "intro": "Opuntia tapona, commonly known as the Mexican spineless cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems known as cladodes. These stems are typically ribbed and covered with small, hairless areoles, from which spines, flowers, and later fruits develop. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Opuntia tapona is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
