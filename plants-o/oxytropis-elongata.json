    "intro": "Oxytropis elongata, commonly known as the longleaf burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxytropis elongata is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
