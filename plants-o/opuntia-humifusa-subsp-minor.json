    "intro": "Opuntia humifusa subsp. minor, commonly known as the lowland prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red or orange fruits. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
