    "intro": "Opuntia molinensis, commonly known as the Molin's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Opuntia molinensis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
