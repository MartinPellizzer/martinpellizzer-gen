    "intro": "Ophiopogon cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese grass or bamboo root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Ophiopogon cavaleriei is valued for its ornamental foliage and its traditional use in Chinese medicine."
