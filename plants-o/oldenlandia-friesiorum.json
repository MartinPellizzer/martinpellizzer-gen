It is a trailing perennial that produces small, white or pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along structures. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
