    "intro": "Oxydectes draco, commonly known as the dragon blood tree, is a succulent plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces a red resin, known as dragon's blood, which has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and as a dye. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in arid environments. The dragon blood tree is also a keystone species in its native habitat, supporting a variety of local wildlife."
