    "intro": "Oxytropis, commonly known as locoweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their erect or sprawling growth habit and often have compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They produce small, pea-like flowers that can range in color from white to purple, depending on the species. Many Oxytropis species are toxic to livestock, earning them their common name due to their association with poisoning in grazing animals."
