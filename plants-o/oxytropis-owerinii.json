    "intro": "Oxytropis owerinii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or pale purple, which bloom in early summer. Oxytropis owerinii is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
