    "intro": "Oenothera cognata, commonly known as the plains evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in open habitats like prairies and disturbed soils, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Oenothera cognata is also known for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing oils used in traditional and modern herbal remedies."
