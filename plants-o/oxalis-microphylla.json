    "intro": "Oxalis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often resembling those of true sorrels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Oxalis microphylla is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to enrich soil through its nitrogen-fixing properties."
