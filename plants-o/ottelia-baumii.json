    "intro": "Ottelia baumii, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, with its leaves floating on the surface. The plant has elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in clusters. Ottelia baumii plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
