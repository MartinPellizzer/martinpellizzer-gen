    "intro": "Oberonia aporophylla, commonly known as the naked-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its distinctive lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its elongated stems. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in primary rainforest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
