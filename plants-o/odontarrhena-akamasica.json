    "intro": "Odontarrhena akamasica, commonly known as the Akamasica orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually small and clustered. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
