    "intro": "Oxytropis lambertii var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the white locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its yellow to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
