    "intro": "Orobanche glaberrima, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale in color, and it is often found in dry, disturbed soils. It is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East, and it is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops it infests."
