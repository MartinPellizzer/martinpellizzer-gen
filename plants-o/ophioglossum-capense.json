    "intro": "Ophioglossum capense, commonly known as the Cape adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology, featuring a single, fleshy, tongue-shaped leaf that emerges from a short, horizontal rhizome. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the leaf margins, a feature typical of its evolutionary lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum capense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
