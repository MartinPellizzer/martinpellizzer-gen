    "intro": "Oncidium caudatum, commonly known as the Cattleya orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous flower spikes that bear numerous fragrant, showy blooms. The plant typically has strap-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. Oncidium caudatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
