    "intro": "Ophrys spruneri var. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Bee Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings resembling a bee's face. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, which are attracted by the flower's mimicry of a female bee. This orchid is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas."
