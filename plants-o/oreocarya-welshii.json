    "intro": "Oreocarya welshii, commonly known as the Welsh's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the western United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant typically features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Oreocarya welshii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
