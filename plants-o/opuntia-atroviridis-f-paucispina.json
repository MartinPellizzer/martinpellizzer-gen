    "intro": "Opuntia atroviridis f. paucispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined green prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features flattened, pad-like stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its spines are shorter and more sparse compared to other Opuntia species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
