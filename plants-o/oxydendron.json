It is characterized by its fragrant, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are elliptical, dark green, and often have a slight waxy coating. Its fruit is a small, yellowish drupe that matures in the fall. Oxydendron is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
