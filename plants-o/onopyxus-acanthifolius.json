    "intro": "Onopyxus acanthifolius, commonly known as the spiny-leaved onopyxus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a woody base with a dense cluster of fleshy, spiny leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help to reflect sunlight and minimize transpiration. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
