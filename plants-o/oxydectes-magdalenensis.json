    "intro": "Oxydectes magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen Island dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Oxydectes magdalenensis thrives in coastal environments, often growing on sandy or gravelly soils. Its limited distribution and specific habitat make it a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
