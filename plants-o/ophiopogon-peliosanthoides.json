    "intro": "Ophiopogon peliosanthoides, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms low-growing mats. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense ground cover, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
