    "intro": "Omphalobium lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's sowing grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces seeds in early spring. Lambert's sowing grass is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for native wildlife."
