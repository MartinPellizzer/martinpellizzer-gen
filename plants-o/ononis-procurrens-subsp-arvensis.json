    "intro": "Ononis procurrens subsp. arvensis, commonly known as field catchfly, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branching stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, with small, opposite leaves that are linear to ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically followed by slender, cylindrical seed capsules that release fine, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
