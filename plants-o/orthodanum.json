    "intro": "Orthodanum, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Orthodanum is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially toxic to livestock."
