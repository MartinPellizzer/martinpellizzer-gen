    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea nothosubsp. delfuocoi, commonly known as the Delfuoco's bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a yellow face with dark markings that mimic the appearance of a bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a unique scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
