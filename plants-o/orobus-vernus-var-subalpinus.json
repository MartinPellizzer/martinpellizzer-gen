It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold and windy conditions of its habitat. This variety is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
