    "intro": "Osmites calycina, commonly known as the golden cup plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features striking yellow flowers that resemble miniature cups, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Osmites calycina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
