    "intro": "Oxalis comosa, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread via stolons, forming dense, low-growing mats."
