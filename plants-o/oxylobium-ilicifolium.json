    "intro": "Oxylobium ilicifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved holly-leafed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its growth habit is typically upright, with multiple stems forming a dense shrub. Oxylobium ilicifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
