    "intro": "Oncidium hapalotyle f. kalbreyerianum, commonly known as the Kalbreyer's Oncidium, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its leaves are strap-like, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
