    "intro": "Orobanche carlinoides, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on its host, and it can significantly impact the growth of agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in cultivated fields."
