    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 costae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant that results from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to orange with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 costae is a perennial herbaceous plant with a short stem and a single, showy flower that blooms in late spring."
