    "intro": "Oxalis nematodes, commonly known as wood sorrel, are flowering plants belonging to the family Oxalidaceae. They are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that can range in color from white to pink, red, or yellow. These plants are native to the Americas but have been introduced to other regions, often thriving in moist, shaded environments. Oxalis species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them beneficial in certain ecological contexts. However, some varieties are considered invasive and can outcompete native plants in their habitats."
