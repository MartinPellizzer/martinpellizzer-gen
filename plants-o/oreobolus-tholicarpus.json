    "intro": "Oreobolus tholicarpus, commonly known as the woolly burr grass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted, hairy leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, spiny capsules that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing. Oreobolus tholicarpus is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
