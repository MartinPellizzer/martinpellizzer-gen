    "intro": "Oncidium stenostalix, commonly known as the narrow-stalked orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during dry periods. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Oncidium stenostalix is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
