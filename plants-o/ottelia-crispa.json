    "intro": "Ottelia crispa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Ottelia crispa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
