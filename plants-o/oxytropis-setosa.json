It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellow pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its root system is capable of fixing nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Oxytropis setosa is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
