    "intro": "Ouratea mannii var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed ouratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. This variant is distinguished by its shorter stem compared to the typical form of Ouratea mannii."
