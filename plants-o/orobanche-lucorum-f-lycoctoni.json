    "intro": "Orobanche lucorum f. lycoctoni, commonly known as the common yellow broom. This parasitic plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically infests the roots of leguminous plants such as vetch and clover. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in clusters. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host species, making it an important indicator of certain soil and ecological conditions."
