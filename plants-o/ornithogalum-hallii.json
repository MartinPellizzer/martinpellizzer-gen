It features a short, underground rhizome and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often mistaken for grasses or sedges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Ornithogalum hallii is also known for its fragrant blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
