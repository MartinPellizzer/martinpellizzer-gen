    "intro": "Opuntia stapeliae, commonly known as the Stapelia Opuntia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that store water. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent, often described as similar to rotting meat. Opuntia stapeliae is adapted to arid environments, featuring spines that provide protection from herbivores and reduce water loss. Its growth habit makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens in dry climates."
