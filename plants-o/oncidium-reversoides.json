    "intro": "Oncidium reversoides, commonly known as the reverse orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often dark green with a waxy coating. Oncidium reversoides is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light."
