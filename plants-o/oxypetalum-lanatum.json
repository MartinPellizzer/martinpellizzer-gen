    "intro": "Oxypetalum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly oxypetalum, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
