    "intro": "Oxytropis calcareorum, commonly known as the limestone milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its deep taproot system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. Oxytropis calcareorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
