    "intro": "Ophrys expansa, commonly known as the broad-leafed bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Ophrys expansa is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, blooming in late spring to early summer."
