    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 tinyusi, commonly known as the tinyus orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys \u00d7 tinyusi is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
