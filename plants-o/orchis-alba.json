    "intro": "Orchis alba, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy white or pale yellow flower with a distinctive lip, typical of orchid morphology. It thrives in woodland and shaded areas, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Orchis alba is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and moths."
