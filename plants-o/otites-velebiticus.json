    "intro": "Otites velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit otite, is a rare flowering plant native to the Dinaric Alps, primarily found in Croatia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the humid, mountainous climate of its native region. Otites velebiticus has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
