    "intro": "Opophytum fastigiatum, commonly known as the zigzag cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with a zigzag pattern, which helps it store water and reduce surface area for evaporation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to spines, typical of many cacti, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Opophytum fastigiatum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
