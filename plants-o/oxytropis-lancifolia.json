It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, compound leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Oxytropis lancifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
