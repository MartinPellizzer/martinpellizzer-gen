    "intro": "Orchis globosa var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive globular flower spike that appears in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. The slender globeflower is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
