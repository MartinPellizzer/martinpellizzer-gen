    "intro": "Osmunda japonica var. divisa, commonly known as the divided fern, is a deciduous fern native to Japan and Korea. It features a distinctive frond structure with a central axis and divided, pinnately arranged leaflets. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are typically bright green and can reach up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking ornamental plant."
