    "intro": "Ornithogalum namaquanulum, commonly known as the Namibian star-of-Bethlehem, is a succulent plant native to the Namib Desert. It features strap-like, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces a tall, branched stem with small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It blooms during the brief rainy season, often in winter, and is adapted to extreme temperatures and limited moisture. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a striking example of desert flora."
