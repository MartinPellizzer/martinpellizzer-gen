    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii var. polyxo, commonly known as the Heldreich's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
