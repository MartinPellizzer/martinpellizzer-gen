    "intro": "Oxalis polyphylla var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped leaflet and produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It is adapted to full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and contributes to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
