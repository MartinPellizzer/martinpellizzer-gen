It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, cool environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives on mossy substrates. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces intricate, fragrant blooms that attract specific pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
