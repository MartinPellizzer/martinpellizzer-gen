    "intro": "Orobus emodi var. majalis, commonly known as the Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that often bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in steep, mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
