    "intro": "Orfilea ankafinensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane rainforests. Its botanical features include fleshy roots and a sympodial growth pattern, which help it survive in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
