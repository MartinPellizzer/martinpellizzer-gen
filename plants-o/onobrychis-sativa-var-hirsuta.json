It is characterized by its hairy, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil. It thrives in temperate climates and is adaptable to various soil types. Its growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
