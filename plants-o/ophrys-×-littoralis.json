    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bee orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or brown with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 littoralis is a rare and specialized orchid, often found in specific microhabitats along the coast."
