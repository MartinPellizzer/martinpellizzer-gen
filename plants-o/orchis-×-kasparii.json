    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 kasparii, commonly known as the Kaspari orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in the temperate regions of Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
