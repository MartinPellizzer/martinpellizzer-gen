    "intro": "Opuntia cochenillifera, commonly known as the cochineal cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can store water in its thick stems. Additionally, it is known for its historical use in the production of cochineal dye, derived from the insects that inhabit its pads."
