    "intro": "Oncocarpus trachyphyllus, commonly known as the rough-leafed mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in saline environments. Its roots often form a dense network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion. Oncocarpus trachyphyllus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
