    "intro": "Odontonema nitidum f. album, commonly known as the white-flowered odontonema, is a rare and striking variant of the Odontonema nitidum species. It is characterized by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This cultivar is prized for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
