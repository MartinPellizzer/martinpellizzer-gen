    "intro": "Onopordum ferox, commonly known as Spanish thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across arid and rocky habitats. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in dry landscapes. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
