    "intro": "Opuntia cyclodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, spineless stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia cyclodes is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. Its structure and growth habits make it a valuable plant for desert landscaping and ecological restoration."
