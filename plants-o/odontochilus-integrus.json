    "intro": "Odontochilus integrus, commonly known as the toothed lip orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on the lip of its flowers, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as a small, terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories."
