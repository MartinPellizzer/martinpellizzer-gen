    "intro": "Oncidium calochilum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a herbaceous plant with a sympodial growth habit, featuring pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting veining. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Oncidium calochilum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
