    "intro": "Oxalis ciliifera, commonly known as the velvetleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of true sorrel species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis ciliifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
