    "intro": "Ornithocephalus castelfrancoi, commonly known as the Castelfranco's ornithocephalus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
