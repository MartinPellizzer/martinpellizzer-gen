    "intro": "Odontochilus gracilis, commonly known as the slender-rooted orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and compact inflorescence that bears fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic substrates for optimal growth. Its roots are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures that aid in nutrient absorption. Odontochilus gracilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
