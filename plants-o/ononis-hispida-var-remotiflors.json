    "intro": "Ononis hispida var. remotiflors, commonly known as the remote-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly slopes, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh habitats."
