    "intro": "Oritrophium blepharophyllum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its unique, small, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The ghost flower is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by Indigenous peoples for various traditional purposes."
