    "intro": "Opuntia xanthoglochia, commonly known as the yellow glochidial prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of small, yellow spines called glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia xanthoglochia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
