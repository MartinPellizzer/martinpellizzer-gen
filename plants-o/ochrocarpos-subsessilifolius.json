It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features narrow, sessile leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
