    "intro": "Odontophorus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the wet tropical forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found growing on trees or in shaded, humid environments. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, Odontophorus is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
