    "intro": "Opuntia pyrrhacantha var. leucolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers. The plant produces edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas, which are typically yellow or red in color. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
