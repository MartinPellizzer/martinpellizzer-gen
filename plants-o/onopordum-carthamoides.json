    "intro": "Onopordum carthamoides, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring spiny stems and large, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble a goat's beard. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Onopordum carthamoides is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in traditional herbal remedies."
