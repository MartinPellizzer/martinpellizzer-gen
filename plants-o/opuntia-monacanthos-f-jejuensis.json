    "intro": "Opuntia monacanthos f. jejuensis, commonly known as the Jeju opuntia, is a unique cactus species native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in clusters of small, spiny glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
