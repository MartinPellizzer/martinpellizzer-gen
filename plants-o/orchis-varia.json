It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing flowers that range in color from purple to white. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Orchis varia thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
