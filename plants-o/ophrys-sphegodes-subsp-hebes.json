    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. hebes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths, often in nutrient-poor soils. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, bee-like shape. The subspecies hebes is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more elongated floral structure compared to other subspecies of Ophrys sphegodes."
