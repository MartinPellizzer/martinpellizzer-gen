    "intro": "Ochna lucida, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Ochna lucida is well adapted to dry conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and striking fruit, which also provide food for birds and other wildlife."
