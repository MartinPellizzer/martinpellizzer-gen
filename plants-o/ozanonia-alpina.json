    "intro": "Ozanonia alpina, commonly known as the alpine ozanonia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Ozanonia alpina is often found in meadows and forest edges at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Its short growing season and specific habitat requirements make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
