    "intro": "Ossaea costata, commonly known as the Costate Ossaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive ribbed or costate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Ossaea costata is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh conditions with its compact growth habit."
