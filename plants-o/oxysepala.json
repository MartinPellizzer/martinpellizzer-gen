    "intro": "Oxysepala, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits. Oxysepala is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
