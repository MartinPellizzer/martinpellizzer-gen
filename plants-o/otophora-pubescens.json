    "intro": "Otophora pubescens, commonly known as the hairy otophora, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help in reducing water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Otophora pubescens is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
