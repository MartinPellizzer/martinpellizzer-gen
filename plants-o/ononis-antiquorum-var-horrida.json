It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
