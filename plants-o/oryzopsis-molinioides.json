    "intro": "Oryzopsis molinioides, commonly known as the slender wild rice, is a grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Its seeds are similar in appearance to those of cultivated rice, which has led to its historical use by indigenous peoples. Oryzopsis molinioides plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
