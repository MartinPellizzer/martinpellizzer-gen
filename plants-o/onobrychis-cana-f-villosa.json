    "intro": "Onobrychis cana f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility. This species is often used in ecological restoration and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
