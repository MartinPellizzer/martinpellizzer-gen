    "intro": "Ozothamnus obcordatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenbush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features include small, glandular leaves and a compact growth habit. Ozothamnus obcordatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
