It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its small, granular seeds, which are enclosed in a membranous capsule. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum millegranum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
