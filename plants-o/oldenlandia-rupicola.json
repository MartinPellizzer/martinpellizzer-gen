    "intro": "Oldenlandia rupicola, commonly known as rockstar vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are wiry and capable of climbing or trailing over surfaces.
