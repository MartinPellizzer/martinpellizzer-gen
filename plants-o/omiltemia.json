It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, showy flowers that bloom in shades of violet and blue. The plant produces small, oval berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Omiltemia thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a decorative vine."
