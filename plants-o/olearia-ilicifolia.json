    "intro": "Olearia ilicifolia, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves arranged in a dense, rounded shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia ilicifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
