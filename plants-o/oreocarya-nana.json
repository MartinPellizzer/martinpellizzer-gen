    "intro": "Oreocarya nana, commonly known as the dwarf oreocarya, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it forms dense mats or low-growing clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pale green or yellow and appear in late summer. Oreocarya nana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes."
