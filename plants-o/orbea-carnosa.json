    "intro": "Orbea carnosa, commonly known as the woolly orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Orbea carnosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
