    "intro": "Oreogrammitis sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak wall-rush, is a rare and specialized fern that thrives in the humid, shaded environments of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats that help retain moisture in the ecosystem. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in small, inconspicuous clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis sarawakensis is considered a valuable indicator of undisturbed, primary forest conditions."
