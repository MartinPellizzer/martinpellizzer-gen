    "intro": "Oxalis umbellata, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet shaped like a heart, and clusters of small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the true sorrel species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are usually prostrate or creeping, and it produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis umbellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a ground cover."
