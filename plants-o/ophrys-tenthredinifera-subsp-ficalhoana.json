    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. ficalhoana, commonly known as the Ficalho's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposure. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
