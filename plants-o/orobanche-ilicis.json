    "intro": "Orobanche ilicis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and rose families. Due to its lack of photosynthesis, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
