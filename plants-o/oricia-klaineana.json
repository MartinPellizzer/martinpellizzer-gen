    "intro": "Oricia klaineana, commonly known as the Klainean orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, often purple or violet-colored flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oricia klaineana is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
