    "intro": "Oxytropis physocarpa, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that contain several seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Oxytropis physocarpa plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
