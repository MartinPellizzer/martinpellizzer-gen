    "intro": "Oberonia kamlangensis, commonly known as the Kamlangensis Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia kamlangensis is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
