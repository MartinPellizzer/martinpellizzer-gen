It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and typically exhibits a pale to golden hue when mature. This variety is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in warm, humid conditions with abundant rainfall. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a panicle inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant's reproductive cycle is closely tied to seasonal monsoons, making it a vital crop in regions with distinct wet and dry seasons."
