    "intro": "Oxalis latifolia subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the genus Oxalis. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces edible, sour-tasting berries. Oxalis latifolia subsp. latifolia is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional medicine."
