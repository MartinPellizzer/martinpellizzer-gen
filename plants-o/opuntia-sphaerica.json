    "intro": "Opuntia sphaerica, commonly known as the globe cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection from herbivores. Opuntia sphaerica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
