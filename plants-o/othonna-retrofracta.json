    "intro": "Othonna retrofracta, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a succulent shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features dense, fleshy foliage that is often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress or during winter. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. Othonna retrofracta is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
