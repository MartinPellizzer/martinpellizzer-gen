It features long, narrow leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. Oncidium reichenheimii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
