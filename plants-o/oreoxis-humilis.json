    "intro": "Oreoxis humilis, commonly known as the low oreoxis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture conditions. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming during the cooler months. Oreoxis humilis is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a resilient species in its native environment."
