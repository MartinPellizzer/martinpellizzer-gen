    "intro": "Orchis traunsteinerioides, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has a complex floral structure with a lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns and markings. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
