    "intro": "Osmorhiza leibergii, commonly known as Leiberg's sweetroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbrella-like flower clusters. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that stores nutrients and moisture, enabling it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and its flowers are small, white to greenish in color, appearing in late spring to early summer. Osmorhiza leibergii is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
