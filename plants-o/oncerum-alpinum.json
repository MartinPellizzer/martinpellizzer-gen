    "intro": "Oncerum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant features a slender, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncerum alpinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments."
