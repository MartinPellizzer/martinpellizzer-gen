    "intro": "Orobus macrorrhizus var. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to absorb nutrients from poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
