    "intro": "Oenothera biennis var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"strigosa.\" The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its oil-rich seeds."
