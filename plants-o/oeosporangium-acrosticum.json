It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is known for its acrostic arrangement of leaflets, which gives it its common name. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous growth habit and a preference for moist, shaded environments. Oeosporangium acrosticum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in humid conditions."
