    "intro": "Otocalyx, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae, consists of shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers that attract pollinators. Otocalyx species typically have woody stems and produce capsules as their fruit type. They are often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
