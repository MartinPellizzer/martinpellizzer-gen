    "intro": "Oenothera litorea, commonly known as beach evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and shorelines. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Oenothera litorea is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
