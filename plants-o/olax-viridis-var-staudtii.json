    "intro": "Olax viridis var. staudtii, commonly known as the green olax, is a shrub native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its succulent, elongated leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its stems are cylindrical and can branch out to form dense shrubs, which helps it survive in arid environments. The leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for semi-desert and coastal regions."
