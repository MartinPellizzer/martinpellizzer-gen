    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. specularia, commonly known as the showy bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a dense cluster of showy, pale yellow to brownish-purple blooms. The variety specularia is distinguished by its more elongated and showy floral structures compared to the typical form of Ophrys aranifera."
