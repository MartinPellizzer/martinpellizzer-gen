    "intro": "Ophrys cretica f. beloniae, commonly known as the Belonia Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex, bee-mimicking labellum that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
