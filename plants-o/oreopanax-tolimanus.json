    "intro": "Oreopanax tolimanus, commonly known as the Tolima oreopanax, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and striking inflorescences. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cooler, moist conditions. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by local communities for its purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Oreopanax tolimanus remains a relatively understudied species with potential ecological and medicinal significance."
