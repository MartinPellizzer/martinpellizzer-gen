    "intro": "Odontostomum hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body and variable coloration. The plant, though not a true plant, is a type of mollusk and exhibits unique botanical-like features such as its gelatinous mantle and radula. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and plays a role in marine ecosystems through its herbivorous diet. Odontostomum hartwegii is often used in scientific studies to understand mollusk biology and ecological interactions."
