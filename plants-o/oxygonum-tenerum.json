    "intro": "Oxygonum tenerum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a tropical annual herb native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Oxygonum tenerum is also known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
