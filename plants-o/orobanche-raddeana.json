    "intro": "Orobanche raddeana, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, usually white or yellow flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in cultivated environments."
