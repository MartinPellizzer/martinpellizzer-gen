    "intro": "Orania zheae, commonly known as the Zheae orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces compact inflorescences with small, clustered flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orania zheae is considered a vulnerable species."
