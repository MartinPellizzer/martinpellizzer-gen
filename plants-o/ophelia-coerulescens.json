    "intro": "Ophelia coerulescens, commonly known as the blue water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Its flowers are small and white or pale blue, often appearing in clusters near the water's edge. Ophelia coerulescens plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
