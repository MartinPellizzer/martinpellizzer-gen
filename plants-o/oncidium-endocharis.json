    "intro": "Oncidium endocharis, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting blooms that typically feature bright yellow petals with red tips. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment it thrives in. Oncidium endocharis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
