It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for gardens. Its hardy nature and attractive appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
