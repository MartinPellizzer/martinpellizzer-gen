    "intro": "Ornithidium chloroleucum, commonly known as the white-stemmed liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, leaf-like structures called thallus, which are typically green and covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are short and often clustered at the base of the thallus. Ornithidium chloroleucum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
