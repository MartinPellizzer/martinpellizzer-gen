    "intro": "Opuntia stanlyi var. wrightiana, commonly known as the Wright's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia stanlyi var. wrightiana is a drought-tolerant plant with a distinctive appearance that makes it well-suited for xeriscaping."
