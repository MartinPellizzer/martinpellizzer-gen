    "intro": "Ougeinia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact, bushy growth habit and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. Ougeinia species typically have thick, fleshy leaves that are often velvety in texture. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, such as Ougeinia fruticosa, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
