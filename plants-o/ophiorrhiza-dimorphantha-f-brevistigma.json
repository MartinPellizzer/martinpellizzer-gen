    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza dimorphantha f. brevistigma, commonly known as the short-stigma sandalwood, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and distinctive floral structure, with short stamens and a reduced stigma. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
