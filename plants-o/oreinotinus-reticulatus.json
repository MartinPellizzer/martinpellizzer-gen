    "intro": "Oreinotinus reticulatus, commonly known as the reticulated orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, net-like patterns on its leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
