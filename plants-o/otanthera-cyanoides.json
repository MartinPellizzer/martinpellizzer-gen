    "intro": "Otanthera cyanoides, commonly known as blue oatgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, blue-green foliage and its showy, fluffy seed heads that resemble small clouds. The plant belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its flowers are typically wind-pollinated, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Otanthera cyanoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
