    "intro": "Oxylepis lanata, commonly known as the woolly oxylepis, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. Oxylepis lanata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
