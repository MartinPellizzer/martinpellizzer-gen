    "intro": "Ophrys lesbis var. mandalyana, commonly known as the Mandalyan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns resembling bee wings. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
