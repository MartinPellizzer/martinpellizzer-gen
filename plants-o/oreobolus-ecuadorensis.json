    "intro": "Oreobolus ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Ecuador. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, clustered flowers that are often white or pale pink in color. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
