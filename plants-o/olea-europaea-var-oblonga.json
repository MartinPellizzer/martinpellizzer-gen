    "intro": "Olea europaea var. oblonga, commonly known as the oblong leaf olive, is a variant of the common olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically darker green and slightly broader than those of the standard olive. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible olives that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a climate with mild winters and hot, dry summers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its contribution to olive oil production."
