    "intro": "Oldenlandia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited mistletoe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to a host tree and derives some of its nutrients from it while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in umbels. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific."
