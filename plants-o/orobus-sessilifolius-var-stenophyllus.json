    "intro": "Orobus sessilifolius var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orobus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
