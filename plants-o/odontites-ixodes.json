    "intro": "Odontites ixodes, commonly known as the purple false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Odontites ixodes thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
