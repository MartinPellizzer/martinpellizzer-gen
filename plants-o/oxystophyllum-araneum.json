    "intro": "Oxystophyllum araneum, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals that resemble the legs of a spider. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in wet, swampy habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxystophyllum araneum is considered a vulnerable species."
