    "intro": "Ophioglossum schmidii, commonly known as the Schmid's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that often has a distinct, tongue-like projection at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaf, which are typically clustered in a row. It is native to southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa and Namibia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum schmidii is considered a vulnerable species."
