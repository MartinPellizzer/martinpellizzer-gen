    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza calliantha, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhizophoraceae and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including a dense covering of fine, silvery hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a halophyte. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. Ophiorrhiza calliantha is often found in mangrove swamps and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
