    "intro": "Oreogenia ferghanica, commonly known as the Ferghana mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred orchid flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the thin soil layers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogenia ferghanica is considered a vulnerable species."
