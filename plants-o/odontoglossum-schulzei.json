    "intro": "Odontoglossum schulzei, commonly known as the Schulze's orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Odontoglossum schulzei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and unique floral structure."
