    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites var. cornigera, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a spider, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces a single, showy flower with a specialized lip that plays a role in pollination by mimicking the appearance of a female wasp. This orchid is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed environments and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
