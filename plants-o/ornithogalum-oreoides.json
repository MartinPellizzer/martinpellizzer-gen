    "intro": "Ornithogalum oreoides, commonly known as the mountain star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette, while its stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences. Ornithogalum oreoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
