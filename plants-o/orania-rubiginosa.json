    "intro": "Orania rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red or purple stems and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Orania rubiginosa is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
