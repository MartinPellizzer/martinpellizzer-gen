    "intro": "Oxalis globosa, commonly known as the globe oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive globe-shaped inflorescence, which consists of small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant often has a creeping habit with hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Oxalis globosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
