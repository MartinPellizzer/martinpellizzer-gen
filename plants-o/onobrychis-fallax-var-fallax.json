It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps it tolerate drought conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
