It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate touch to its foliage. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, white pubescence that gives it a frosty appearance. Olearia picridifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
