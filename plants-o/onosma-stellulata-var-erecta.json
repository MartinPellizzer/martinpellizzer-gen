It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged alternately along the stem. This variant is distinguished by its more erect growth habit compared to other varieties of Onosma stellulata."
