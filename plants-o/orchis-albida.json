    "intro": "Orchis albida, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of white to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and the roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine. Orchis albida thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species."
