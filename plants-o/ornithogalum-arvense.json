It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Ornithogalum arvense is often found in disturbed habitats and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
