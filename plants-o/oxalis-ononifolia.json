    "intro": "Oxalis ononifolia, commonly known as false shamrock, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the true shamrock, and small, delicate flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Oxalis ononifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
