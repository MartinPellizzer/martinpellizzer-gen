    "intro": "Oenothera propinqua, commonly known as the plains evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in open habitats like prairies and sandy soils, and it is well adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Oenothera propinqua is also known for its ability to self-pollinate, which helps it thrive in isolated or disturbed environments."
