    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. montis-gargani, commonly known as the Gargano bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings that resemble bee body patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
