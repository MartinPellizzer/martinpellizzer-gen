    "intro": "Orchis russowii, commonly known as the Russow's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinct lip, which is a common feature among orchids. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer and thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Orchis russowii is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
