    "intro": "Ossaea petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas subject to tidal influences. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinct sepal structure that aids in wind pollination. Ossaea petiolaris plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
