    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. durieui, commonly known as the Durie's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to rocky or limestone habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in limited, fragmented populations."
