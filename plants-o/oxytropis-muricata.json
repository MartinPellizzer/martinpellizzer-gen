    "intro": "Oxytropis muricata, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. Oxytropis muricata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem."
