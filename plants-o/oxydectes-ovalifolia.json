    "intro": "Oxydectes ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like white flowers with yellow centers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oxydectes ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
