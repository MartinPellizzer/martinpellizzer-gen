    "intro": "Opuntia robusta var. albicans, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flat, fleshy stems covered in spiny areoles, which bear both spines and flowers. The plant produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pads are thick and ribbed, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The variety is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, setting it apart from other Opuntia species."
