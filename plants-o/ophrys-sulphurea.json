    "intro": "Ophrys sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a yellowish-brown coloration and intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Ophrys sulphurea is known for its specialized relationship with specific pollinators, particularly bees, which are attracted by the floral mimicry."
