It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, with each flower having four lobes, giving it its common name. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The orchid is a perennial herb that blooms in late spring to early summer."
