    "intro": "Ottonia miguelitensis, commonly known as the Miguel's ottonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottonia miguelitensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
