    "intro": "Ononis coriifolia, commonly known as heartleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
