    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale swamp orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 60 cm tall, adorned with lance-shaped, pale green to white leaves. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that is often lighter in color. It blooms from late spring to early summer, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This variety is characterized by its reduced pigmentation compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata."
