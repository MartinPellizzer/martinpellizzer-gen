It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive red or purple venation pattern, and small, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in wet soils. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its ability to form dense mats through rhizome growth.
