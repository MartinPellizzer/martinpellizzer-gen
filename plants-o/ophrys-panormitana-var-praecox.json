    "intro": "Ophrys panormitana var. praecox, commonly known as the early orchid of Pantelleria, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the volcanic island of Pantelleria in Italy. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, including a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. It flowers early in the spring, often before other orchid species, which contributes to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and human activity."
