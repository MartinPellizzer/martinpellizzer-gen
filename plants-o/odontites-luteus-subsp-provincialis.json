    "intro": "Odontites luteus subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the Alpine yellow rampion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and basal rosette of hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has small, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the species."
