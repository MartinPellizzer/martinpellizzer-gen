    "intro": "Olearia dibrachiata, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white to greyish foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in fine, silky hairs that contribute to its unique texture. Olearia dibrachiata is well adapted to coastal and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
