    "intro": "Orobanche erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a taproot system that connects to the roots of its host, typically members of the legume family. It is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host plants."
