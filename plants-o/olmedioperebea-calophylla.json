    "intro": "Olmedioperebea calophylla, commonly known as the African olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by fleshy, yellowish-orange fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine forests. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks."
