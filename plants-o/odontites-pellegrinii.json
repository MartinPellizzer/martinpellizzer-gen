    "intro": "Odontites pellegrinii, commonly known as the Pellegrin's toothplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in late spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontites pellegrinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
