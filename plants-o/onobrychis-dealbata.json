    "intro": "Onobrychis dealbata, commonly known as the white clover or white bursaria, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and agricultural settings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in burs-like structures, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or human clothing."
