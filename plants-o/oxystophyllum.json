The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions. Oxystophyllum typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in coastal areas."
