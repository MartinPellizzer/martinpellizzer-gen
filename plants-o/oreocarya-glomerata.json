    "intro": "Oreocarya glomerata, commonly known as the clustered oreocarya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Oreocarya glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
