    "intro": "Oligolepis sprunnera, commonly known as the sprunner's oligolepis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are narrowly lanceolate and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellowish to brownish in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oligolepis sprunnera is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
