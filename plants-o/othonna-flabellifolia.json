It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, with multiple lobes radiating from a central point. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Othonna flabellifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and drought tolerance."
