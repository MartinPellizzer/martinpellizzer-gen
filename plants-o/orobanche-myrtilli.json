    "intro": "Orobanche myrtilli, commonly known as the common dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species such as heather and bilberry. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is found in acidic, nutrient-poor soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal growth patterns of its host plants, making it a unique and specialized member of the Orobanchaceae family."
