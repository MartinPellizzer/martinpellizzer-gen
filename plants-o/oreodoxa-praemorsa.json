    "intro": "Oreodoxa praemorsa, commonly known as the death orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, often pale or white flowers with a distinct, almost skeletal appearance. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers bloom only briefly, typically during the winter months, and are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreodoxa praemorsa is considered a vulnerable species."
