    "intro": "Orobanche angustelaciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or brownish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like cluster. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often parasitizing plants such as shrubs and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
