    "intro": "Opuntia sanctae-barbarae, commonly known as the Santa Barbara prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to California and Baja California. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Opuntia sanctae-barbarae is also valued for its role in local ecosystems and traditional uses by indigenous communities."
