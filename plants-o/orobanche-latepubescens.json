    "intro": "Orobanche latepubescens, commonly known as the late-hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers, typically in late summer, and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
