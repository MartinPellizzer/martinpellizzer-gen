    "intro": "Ophrys carmeli subsp. rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's abdomen. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
