    "intro": "Opuntia mesacantha var. greenii, commonly known as the green prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green in color, though they may vary in shade depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its spines are modified leaves, providing protection from herbivores and reducing water loss. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
