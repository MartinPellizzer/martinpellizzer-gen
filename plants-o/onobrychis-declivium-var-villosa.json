    "intro": "Onobrychis declivium var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
