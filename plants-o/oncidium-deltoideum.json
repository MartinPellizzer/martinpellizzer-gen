    "intro": "Oncidium deltoideum, commonly known as the delta orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots are adapted to absorb water and nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with high humidity. Oncidium deltoideum is prized by orchid growers for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
