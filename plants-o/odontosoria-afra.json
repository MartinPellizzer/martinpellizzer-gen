    "intro": "Odontosoria afra, commonly known as the African tooth fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnately compound and often have a distinctive, tooth-like appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Odontosoria afra is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in some African countries."
