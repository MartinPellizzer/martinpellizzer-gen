    "intro": "Ononis hircina var. inermis, commonly known as the soft hoary vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky or sandy soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
