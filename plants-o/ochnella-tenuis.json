    "intro": "Ochnella tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Ochnella tenuis is often found in coastal and inland forested areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
