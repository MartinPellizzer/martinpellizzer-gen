    "intro": "Oncidium herrenhusanum, commonly known as the Herrenhausen orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a sympodial orchid with a short, stocky rhizome and produces multiple pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Oncidium herrenhusanum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with regular watering. It is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
