It belongs to the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green in color, giving the plant its common name, and they are often covered in a waxy coating. Otatea glauca produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by dark blue, spherical berries. This species is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions."
