    "intro": "Oxytropis japonica, commonly known as Japanese burclover, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxytropis japonica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and fix nitrogen."
