    "intro": "Oreocarya semiglabra, commonly known as the smoothleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple during the summer months. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Oreocarya semiglabra is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
