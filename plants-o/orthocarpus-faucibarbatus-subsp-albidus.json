It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The subspecies albidus is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the green foliage. It typically grows in moist, temperate habitats and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential ecological roles in its native environment."
