    "intro": "Oldenlandia adscensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the remote island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, herbaceous species that typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Oldenlandia adscensionis is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its isolated habitat, making it a unique example of island endemism."
