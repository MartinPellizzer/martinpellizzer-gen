    "intro": "Odontorrhynchus castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
