    "intro": "Oxytropis leucantha var. leuchippiana, commonly known as the white locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
