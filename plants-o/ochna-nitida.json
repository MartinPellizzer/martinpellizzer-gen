    "intro": "Ochna nitida, commonly known as the white ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ochna nitida is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
