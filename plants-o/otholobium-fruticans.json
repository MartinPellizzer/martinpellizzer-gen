    "intro": "Otholobium fruticans, commonly known as the fruiting otholobium, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Otholobium fruticans is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in plant taxonomy."
