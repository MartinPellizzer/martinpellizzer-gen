    "intro": "Orobanche cernua var. taurica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, including crops like wheat and barley, causing significant agricultural damage. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological interactions but is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
