    "intro": "Oreocarya multicaulis, commonly known as the Sierra dwarf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, typically found in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped seed capsules. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oreocarya multicaulis is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions and is often found in mountainous regions."
