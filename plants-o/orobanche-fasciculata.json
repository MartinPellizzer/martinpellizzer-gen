    "intro": "Orobanche fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a fascicle, giving it its common name. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an important subject in ecological and agricultural studies. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
