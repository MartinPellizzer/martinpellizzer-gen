It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and dense clusters of pale pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem, a feature typical of the Orchidaceae family. This nothovar exhibits a range of color variations, making it a visually striking and ecologically significant plant in its native environment."
