    "intro": "Ouratea \u00d7 acunae, commonly known as the hybrid beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright blue to purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption due to their tart flavor. The plant's ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and vibrant fruit display."
