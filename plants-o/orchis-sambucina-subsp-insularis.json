    "intro": "Orchis sambucina subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Mediterranean orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
