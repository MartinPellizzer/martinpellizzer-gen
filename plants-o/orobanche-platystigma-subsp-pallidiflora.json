    "intro": "Orobanche platystigma subsp. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, pale yellow or white flowers. This subspecies typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. It is found in parts of Europe and Asia, where it parasitizes various herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
