    "intro": "Orobanche cyamophya, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and some grasses. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
