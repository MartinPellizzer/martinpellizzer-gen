    "intro": "Odontosoria reyesii, commonly known as the Mexican tooth fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like lobes on the fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in high humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontosoria reyesii is considered a species of conservation concern."
