    "intro": "Ononis microphylla, commonly known as lesser whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in short inflorescences. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed ground. Ononis microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
