    "intro": "Opercularia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy opercularia, is a small, annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Sphagnum, which includes mosses and related plants, though it is not a true moss. The plant is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
