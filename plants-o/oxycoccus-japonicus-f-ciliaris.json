    "intro": "Oxycoccus japonicus f. ciliaris, commonly known as the Japanese snowberry, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with hairy margins, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to provide winter interest with its red berries."
