    "intro": "Oxytropis arenaria, commonly known as sand bur or desert bur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, disturbed areas. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of spiny, bur-like fruits. Its leaves are usually small and pinnate, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Oxytropis arenaria is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
