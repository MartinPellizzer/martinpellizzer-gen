    "intro": "Opuntia tuna, commonly known as the Indian fig or tuna cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped structures that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia tuna is also notable for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for various animals, including birds and rodents."
