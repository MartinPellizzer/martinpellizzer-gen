    "intro": "Orobanche loricata f. synomora, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. Its parasitic nature makes it a concern for farmers as it can reduce crop yields. The f. synomora form is distinguished by its specific morphological traits, including the shape and color of its flowers and leaves."
