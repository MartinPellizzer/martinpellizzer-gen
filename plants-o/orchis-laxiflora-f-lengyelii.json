    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora f. lengyelii, commonly known as the Lengyel's loose-flowered orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and relatively large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces pendulous, violet or purple flowers with a unique, elongated lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
