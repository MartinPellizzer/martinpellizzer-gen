    "intro": "Ophrys calocaerina, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are yellow with a dark brownish-purple pattern, and it produces small, round, greenish-brown pods containing seeds. Ophrys calocaerina is a perennial herb with a rosette of leaves and is known for its specialized pollination mechanism."
