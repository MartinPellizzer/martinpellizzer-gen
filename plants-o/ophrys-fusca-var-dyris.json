    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. dyris, commonly known as the Dyris bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a distinctive bee-like appearance that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, erect inflorescence bearing several showy, resupinate flowers with a specialized labellum. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
