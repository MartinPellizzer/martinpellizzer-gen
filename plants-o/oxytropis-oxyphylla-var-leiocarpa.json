    "intro": "Oxytropis oxyphylla var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smoothleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with smooth, glabrous surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or arid soils. This species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along dry streambeds."
