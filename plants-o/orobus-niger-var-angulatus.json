    "intro": "Orobus niger var. angulatus, commonly known as the black locust or black thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing flat, brown seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The species is often used in ornamental landscaping and for erosion control due to its hardiness and rapid growth."
