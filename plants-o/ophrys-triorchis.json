    "intro": "Ophrys triorchis, commonly known as the three-lobed helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flower with a complex structure that mimics female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with purple markings and bloom from late spring to early summer. Ophrys triorchis is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, which relies on mimicry to ensure successful reproduction."
