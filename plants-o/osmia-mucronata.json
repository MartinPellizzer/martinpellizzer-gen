    "intro": "Osmia mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-tipped mason bee, is a solitary bee species belonging to the family Megachilidae. It is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is known for its unique nesting behavior. The female constructs small, papery nests using chewed plant fibers, often lining them with pollen for provisioning. The plant-based materials used in nest construction highlight its close relationship with various flowering plants. Osmia mucronata plays an important ecological role in pollination, particularly for fruit trees and ornamental plants."
