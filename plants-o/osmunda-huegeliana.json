    "intro": "Osmunda huegeliana, commonly known as the Hugel's water fern, is a species of royal fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Osmunda huegeliana plays an important role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
