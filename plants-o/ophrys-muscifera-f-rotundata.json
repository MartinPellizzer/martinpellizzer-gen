    "intro": "Ophrys muscifera f. rotundata, commonly known as the rounded marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its distinctive, showy flower spikes that resemble female bees, a feature used in its pollination strategy. The flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that attracts male bees for pollination. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, and it is often found growing in association with other orchid species. Its morphological features, including the specialized lip of the flower, are adaptations that enhance its reproductive success in its native environment."
