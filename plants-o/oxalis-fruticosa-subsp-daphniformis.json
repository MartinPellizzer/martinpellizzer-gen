    "intro": "Oxalis fruticosa subsp. daphniformis, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silver or grayish underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and attractive foliage."
