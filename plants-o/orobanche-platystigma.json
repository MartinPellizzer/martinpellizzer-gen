    "intro": "Orobanche platystigma, commonly known as the broad-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and composite families. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
