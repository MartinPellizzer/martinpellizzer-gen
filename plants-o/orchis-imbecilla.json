    "intro": "Orchis imbecilla, commonly known as the small marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 centimeters and produces a single spike of flowers. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Orchis imbecilla is a relatively rare and protected species due to its specific habitat requirements."
