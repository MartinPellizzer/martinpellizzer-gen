    "intro": "Orobanche glabrata, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often in association with legumes and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
