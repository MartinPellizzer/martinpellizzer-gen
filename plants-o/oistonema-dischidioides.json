It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety purple to violet flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a waxy texture, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic appeal."
