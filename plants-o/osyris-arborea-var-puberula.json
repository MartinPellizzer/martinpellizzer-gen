It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The variety puberula is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other forms of Osyris arborea."
