    "intro": "Olearia tomentosa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting nectar-feeding birds. Its leaves are covered in dense, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. Olearia tomentosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions."
