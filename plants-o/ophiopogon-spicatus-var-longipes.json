    "intro": "Ophiopogon spicatus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spiky grass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscape design for its texture and color."
