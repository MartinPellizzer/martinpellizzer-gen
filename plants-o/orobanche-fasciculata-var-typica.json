    "intro": "Orobanche fasciculata var. typica, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to parasitize host species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on plants such as Astragalus and Crotalaria. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
