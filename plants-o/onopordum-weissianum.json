    "intro": "Onopordum weissianum, commonly known as the Weissianum thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces striking purple to pink composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Onopordum weissianum is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
