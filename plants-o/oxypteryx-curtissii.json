    "intro": "Oxypteryx curtissii, commonly known as the Curtiss's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of mature trees in humid forests. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance that gives it its common name. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, Oxypteryx curtissii is considered critically endangered and is protected in many states."
