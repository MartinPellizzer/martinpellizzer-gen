    "intro": "Opuntia philippii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, succulent taste. Opuntia philippii is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
