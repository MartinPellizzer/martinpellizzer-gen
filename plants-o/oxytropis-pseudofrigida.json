    "intro": "Oxytropis pseudofrigida, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the cold regions of Central Asia and Siberia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or white pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing seeds. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
