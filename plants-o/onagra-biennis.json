    "intro": "Onagra biennis, commonly known as false flax, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It features slender, erect stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are encased in a hard, capsule-like structure, and the plant is known for its high oil content in the seeds. Onagra biennis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for its oil-rich seeds."
