    "intro": "Oxydectes moonii, commonly known as the Moon's Ghost Plant, is a rare and unique succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, low-growing form with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically pale green to bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Oxydectes moonii is prized by collectors for its unusual appearance and slow growth rate."
