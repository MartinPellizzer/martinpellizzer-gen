    "intro": "Osbeckia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved osbeckia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Osbeckia parvifolia is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
