    "intro": "Ormenis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored grass, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing clusters of tiny, two-toned flowers that range from white to pink. Ormenis bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
