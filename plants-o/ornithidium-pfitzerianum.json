    "intro": "Ornithidium pfitzerianum, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a perennial evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that resemble a Christmas tree, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are dimorphic, with sterile fronds being shorter and more compact than the fertile ones. Ornithidium pfitzerianum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
