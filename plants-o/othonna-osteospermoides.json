    "intro": "Othonna osteospermoides, commonly known as the mountain onion or rock onion, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. Othonna osteospermoides is also notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it a hardy plant suited to Mediterranean climates."
