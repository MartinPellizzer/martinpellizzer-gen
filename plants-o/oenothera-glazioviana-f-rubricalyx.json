    "intro": "Oenothera glazioviana f. rubricalyx, commonly known as the red-leaf evening primrose, is a striking variant of the evening primrose species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its vivid red foliage, which contrasts sharply with its typical yellow-orange flowers. The plant belongs to the Onagraceae family and is known for its showy, nocturnal blooms that open in the evening. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique leaf coloration and bioluminescent properties under certain conditions."
