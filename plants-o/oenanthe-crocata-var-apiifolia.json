    "intro": "Oenanthe crocata var. apiifolia, commonly known as the meadow dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it easily distinguishable from other members of its genus."
