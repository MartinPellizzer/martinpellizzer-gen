    "intro": "Oxytropis schmorgunoviae var. tundrarum, commonly known as the Tundra Locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Arctic and alpine tundra regions of Eurasia, where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, compound leaves and sparsely arranged pink or purple flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
