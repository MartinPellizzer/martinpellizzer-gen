    "intro": "Ononis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy restharrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-green hue. Ononis hirsuta is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions."
