    "intro": "Oxytropis viscidula, commonly known as sticky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Oxytropis viscidula is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in arid environments."
