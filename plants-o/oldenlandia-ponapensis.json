    "intro": "Oldenlandia ponapensis, commonly known as the Pohnpei starflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants found throughout the tropics. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or purple calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
