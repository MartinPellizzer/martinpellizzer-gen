    "intro": "Oxypetalum pedicellatum var. itatiaiense, commonly known as the Itatiaia bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered threatened and is of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
