    "intro": "Opuntia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that grow in a zigzag pattern, which helps it adapt to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Opuntia obliqua is well adapted to drought and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in desert ecosystems."
