    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 boudieri, commonly known as the Boudier's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing a dense cluster of showy, violet-blue to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that are often adorned with dark markings. Native to Central and Southern Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
