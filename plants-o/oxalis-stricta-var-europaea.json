    "intro": "Oxalis stricta var. europaea, commonly known as the European wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Oxalis stricta var. europaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
