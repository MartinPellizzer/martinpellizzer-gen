    "intro": "Oxalis paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis paranaensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
