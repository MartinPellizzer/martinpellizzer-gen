    "intro": "Ornithidium semiscabrum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and may have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. The flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination by specific insects."
