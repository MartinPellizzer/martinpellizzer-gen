    "intro": "Ophrys vernixia nothosubsp. buttleri, commonly known as the Bulgarian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
