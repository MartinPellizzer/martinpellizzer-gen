    "intro": "Osmunda spicata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender, cinnamon-colored fiddleheads that unfurl into large, bipinnate fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a central stem that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fertile fronds. Osmunda spicata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
