    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered twayblade, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its distinctive, rose-pink flowers. The plant is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
