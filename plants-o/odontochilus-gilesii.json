    "intro": "Odontochilus gilesii, commonly known as the Philippine toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique tooth-like structures on the lip of its flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
