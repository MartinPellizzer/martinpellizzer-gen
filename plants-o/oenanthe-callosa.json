    "intro": "Oenanthe callosa, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, and it has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Oenanthe callosa is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators."
