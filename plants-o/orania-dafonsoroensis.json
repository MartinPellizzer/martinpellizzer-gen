    "intro": "Orania dafonsoroensis, commonly known as the Dafonsoro endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important subject for botanical research."
