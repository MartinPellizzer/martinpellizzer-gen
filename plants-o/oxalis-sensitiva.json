    "intro": "Oxalis sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive plant or mimosa, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by rapid changes in turgor pressure within the leaf cells. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it has a trailing growth habit that makes it suitable for hanging baskets or containers. Oxalis sensitiva is relatively easy to care for, thriving in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
