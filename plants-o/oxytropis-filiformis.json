    "intro": "Oxytropis filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis filiformis is often found in association with other drought-tolerant plants in its native range."
