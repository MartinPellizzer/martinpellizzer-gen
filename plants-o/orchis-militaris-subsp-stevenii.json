    "intro": "Orchis militaris subsp. stevenii, commonly known as the Steven's military orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and it produces small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
