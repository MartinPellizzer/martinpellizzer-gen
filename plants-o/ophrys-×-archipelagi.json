    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 archipelagi, commonly known as the Aegean bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Aegean Islands. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-like flowers with a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique pollination strategy, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
