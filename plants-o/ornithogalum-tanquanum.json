It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. Ornithogalum tanquanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
