    "intro": "Oenothera hechtii, commonly known as the Hecht's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its capsule fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. Oenothera hechtii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential in ecological restoration projects."
