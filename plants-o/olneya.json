    "intro": "Olneya, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, winged fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Olneya thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and low water availability. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems and a popular choice for xeriscaping."
