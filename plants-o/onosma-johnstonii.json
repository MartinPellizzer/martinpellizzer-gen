It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and ecological role in its native habitat."
