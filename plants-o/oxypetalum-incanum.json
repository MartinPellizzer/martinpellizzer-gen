    "intro": "Oxypetalum incanum, commonly known as the silverleaf oxypetalum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding a delicate appearance to its foliage. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. Oxypetalum incanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest blooms."
