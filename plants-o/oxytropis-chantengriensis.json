    "intro": "Oxytropis chantengriensis, commonly known as the Qinghai oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky habitats, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Oxytropis chantengriensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native region."
