    "intro": "Ormocarpum muricatum, commonly known as the \"spiny apple\" or \"huito,\" is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often woody and branched. The fruit is edible, though its spiny exterior makes it challenging to harvest and consume."
