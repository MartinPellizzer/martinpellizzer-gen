    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata, commonly known as the umbilicated bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive central marking resembling an umbilical cord. Ophrys umbilicata is a short-lived perennial, often found in grasslands and woodland edges."
