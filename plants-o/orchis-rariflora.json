    "intro": "Orchis rariflora, commonly known as the rare orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive underground tuberous root system. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Orchis rariflora is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
