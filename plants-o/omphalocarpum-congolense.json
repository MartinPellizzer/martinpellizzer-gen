    "intro": "Omphalocarpum congolense, commonly known as the African burr or Congo burr, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume fruits. The plant produces distinctive, spiny, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds embedded in a fleshy, pulpy mass. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The plant is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, relying on animals to carry the heavy, spiny fruits."
