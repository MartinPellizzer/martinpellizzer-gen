It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine meadows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. Oreocarya aperta is well adapted to cold, harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
