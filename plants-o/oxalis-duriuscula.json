    "intro": "Oxalis duriuscula, commonly known as the hardy wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. Oxalis duriuscula is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
