    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, by attaching to their roots with specialized haustoria. It is native to the Mediterranean region, including Corsica, Sardinia, and parts of southern Europe. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant with ecological significance in its native habitats."
