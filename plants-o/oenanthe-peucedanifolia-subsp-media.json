    "intro": "Oenanthe peucedanifolia subsp. media, commonly known as the European hemlock, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits called schizocarps. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
