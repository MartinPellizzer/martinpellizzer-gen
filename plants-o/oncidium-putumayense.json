    "intro": "Oncidium putumayense, commonly known as the Putumayo orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Oncidium putumayense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for horticultural purposes."
