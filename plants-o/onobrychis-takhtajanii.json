    "intro": "Onobrychis takhtajanii, commonly known as the Takhtajan's burrclover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces pods that contain several small, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
