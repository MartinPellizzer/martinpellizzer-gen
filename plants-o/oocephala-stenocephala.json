    "intro": "Oocephala stenocephala, commonly known as the narrow-headed water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the day, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor it in shallow water, while its stems help it stay buoyant. Oocephala stenocephala plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
