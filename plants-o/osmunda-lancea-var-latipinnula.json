    "intro": "Osmunda lancea var. latipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a perennial fern that thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow water or moist soil. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have broad, spreading pinnules that give the plant its common name. It reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing sediment."
