The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spike-like cluster. Osbeckia setosoannulata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands."
