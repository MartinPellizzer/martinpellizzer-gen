It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
