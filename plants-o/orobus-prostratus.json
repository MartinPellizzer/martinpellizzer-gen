    "intro": "Orobus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate orobus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, hairy texture. Orobus prostratus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along streambanks."
