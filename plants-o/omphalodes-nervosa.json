    "intro": "Omphalodes nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a compact, low-growing habit with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers during the summer months. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems that rise from a basal rosette of leaves. Omphalodes nervosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant."
