    "intro": "Opuntia humifusa, commonly known as the flat-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a low-growing shrub. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has areoles from which both spines and flowers arise. Opuntia humifusa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions."
