    "intro": "Opuntia attulica, commonly known as the red prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and are often bright red in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia attulica is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
