    "intro": "Oreobolus serrulata, commonly known as the serrated sandmat, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Oreobolus serrulata is well-suited to harsh conditions and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded landscapes."
