    "intro": "Ornithidium jenischianum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a dense, crinkled structure resembling a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture. Ornithidium jenischianum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
