    "intro": "Ornithogalum paludosum, commonly known as the swamp onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale green star-shaped flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils, and its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays an important ecological role in its native wetland ecosystems."
