    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like pseudobulb that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
