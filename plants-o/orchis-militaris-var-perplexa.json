It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, thriving in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
