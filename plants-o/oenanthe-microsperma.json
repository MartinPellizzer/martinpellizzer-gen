    "intro": "Oenanthe microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is known for its mild toxicity due to the presence of furocoumarins. Oenanthe microsperma is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
