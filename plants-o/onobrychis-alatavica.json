    "intro": "Onobrychis alatavica, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Onobrychis alatavica is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
