    "intro": "Oxygonium integrifolium, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Africa. It features whorled leaves that are broad, flat, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate, while its floating leaves provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
