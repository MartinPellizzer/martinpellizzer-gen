    "intro": "Oxydectes ehrenbergii, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access groundwater, and it often grows in rocky or sandy soils. Oxydectes ehrenbergii is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
