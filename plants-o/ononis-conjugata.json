    "intro": "Ononis conjugata, commonly known as clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in sandy or rocky soils. Ononis conjugata is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
