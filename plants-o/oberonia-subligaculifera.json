    "intro": "Oberonia subligaculifera, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted for efficient water absorption in its natural habitat. Oberonia subligaculifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth."
