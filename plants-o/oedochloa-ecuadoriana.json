    "intro": "Oedochloa ecuadoriana, commonly known as Ecuadorian panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Oedochloa ecuadoriana is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
