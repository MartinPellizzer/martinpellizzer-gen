    "intro": "Oligandra, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and dense, woody structure, which help it survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by hard, woody fruits containing small, shiny seeds. Oligandra is adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems. Its slow growth and long lifespan make it an important component of its native habitats."
