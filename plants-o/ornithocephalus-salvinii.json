    "intro": "Ornithocephalus salvinii, commonly known as the Salvin's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its unique floral structure includes specialized petals and a prominent, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithocephalus salvinii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
