    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. corbariensis, commonly known as the Corbi\u00e8res bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the south-western part of France. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to specific microhabitats within the Mediterranean climate zone. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
