    "intro": "Olgaea petri-primi, commonly known as the First-Seed Orchid, is a rare and unique botanical species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent hue under moonlight. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and requires a specific symbiotic relationship with a particular species of mycorrhizal fungus for survival. Its flowering cycle is closely tied to the lunar calendar, blooming only during the first full moon of each season. Due to its ecological sensitivity, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
