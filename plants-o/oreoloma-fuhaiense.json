    "intro": "Oreoloma fuhaiense, commonly known as the Fuhai stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. Its small, star-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. Oreoloma fuhaiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
