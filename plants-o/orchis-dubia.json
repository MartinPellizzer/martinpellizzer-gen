    "intro": "Orchis dubia, commonly known as the rare or uncertain orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, often violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are arranged in a spike with a few to several blooms. Orchis dubia has a complex root system and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
