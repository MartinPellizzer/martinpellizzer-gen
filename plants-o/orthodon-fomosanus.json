    "intro": "Orthodon fomosanus, commonly known as the Fomosa orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, producing a single, showy flower per stem. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
