    "intro": "Opuntia cuija, commonly known as the \"Mexican prickly pear,\" is a species of cactus native to Central America and northern South America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often used as leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits called tunas. Opuntia cuija thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance. Its structure and growth habits make it well adapted to survive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
