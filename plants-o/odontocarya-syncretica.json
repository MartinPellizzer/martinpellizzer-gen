    "intro": "Odontocarya syncretica, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in the summer months, often in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its roots are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Despite its beauty, it is a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
