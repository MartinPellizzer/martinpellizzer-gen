    "intro": "Oplonia, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. The plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white. Oplonia species are often found in heathlands and rocky habitats, where they contribute to the local biodiversity. Their ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions makes them an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
