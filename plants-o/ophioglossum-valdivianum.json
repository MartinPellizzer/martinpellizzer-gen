    "intro": "Ophioglossum valdivianum, commonly known as the Valdivian adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the temperate rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically surrounded by a protective sheath. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces two types of leaves: a sterile, broad leaf and a spore-producing, narrow leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in association with other rare flora in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
