    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear broad, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose, raceme-like clusters. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in moist, calcareous soils. The spotted orchid is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and other open habitats."
