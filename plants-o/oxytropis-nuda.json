    "intro": "Oxytropis nuda, commonly known as the naked oxytropis, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often reduced to scales. Its flowers are typically pale purple or white, appearing in early spring. Oxytropis nuda is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and the ability to fix nitrogen through its association with rhizobia bacteria."
