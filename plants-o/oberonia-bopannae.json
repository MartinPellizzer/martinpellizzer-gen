    "intro": "Oberonia bopannae, commonly known as the Bopanna's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit. The plant typically produces a single, slender stem with several leaves, and its flowers are small, fragrant, and often arranged in a spike. It prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland to montane forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
