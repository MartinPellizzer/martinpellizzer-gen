    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. knorringiana, commonly known as the Knorring's pink orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stem is unbranched and supports the inflorescence. This variant is notable for its specific habitat requirements and is often found in regions with rich, well-drained soils."
