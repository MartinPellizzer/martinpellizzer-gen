    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 kretzschmariorum, commonly known as the Kretzschmar's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, upright stem and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often darker and more intricately shaped. This hybrid thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats across Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid that showcases the genetic diversity within the Orchis genus."
