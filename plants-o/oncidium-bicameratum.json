    "intro": "Oncidium bicameratum, commonly known as the bicameratum orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in racemes. Its roots are adapted for aerial attachment to trees, and it requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth. Oncidium bicameratum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
