    "intro": "Opuntia humifusa subsp. mesacantha, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, pad-like stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible fruits called tunas, which are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
