    "intro": "Oxydenia filiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf oxydenia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and thread-like, giving it its common name. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to tolerate salt spray."
