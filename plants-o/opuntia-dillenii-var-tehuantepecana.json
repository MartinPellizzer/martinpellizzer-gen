    "intro": "Opuntia dillenii var. tehuantepecana, commonly known as the Tehuantepec prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts in its native habitat."
