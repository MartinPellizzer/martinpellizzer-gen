    "intro": "Oncidium luteum, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive golden lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium luteum blooms during the summer months and is prized for its vibrant, long-lasting flowers. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
