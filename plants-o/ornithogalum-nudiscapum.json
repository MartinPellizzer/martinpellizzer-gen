It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, leafless stem that bears clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas. The flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and moths, contributing to its ecological significance."
