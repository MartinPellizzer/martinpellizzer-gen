    "intro": "Oreocarya longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered oreocarya, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect stem and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Oreocarya longiflora plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
