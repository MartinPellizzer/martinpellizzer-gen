    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. transhyrcana, commonly known as the Transhircan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
