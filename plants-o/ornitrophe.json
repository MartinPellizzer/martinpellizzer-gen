It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. The plant features slender stems that bear small, compound leaves resembling bird feathers, giving it its common name. Ornitrophe flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and bloom in late spring. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
