    "intro": "Oxalis paradoxa, commonly known as the coral root oxalis, is a strikingly ornamental plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of bright red, coral-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a perennial, often grown as a houseplant due to its preference for cool, humid conditions. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for shaded gardens or indoor collections. Oxalis paradoxa requires well-draining soil and indirect light to thrive."
