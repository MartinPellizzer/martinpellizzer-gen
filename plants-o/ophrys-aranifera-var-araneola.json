    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a hairy, wasp-like labellum and a greenish-yellow column. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
