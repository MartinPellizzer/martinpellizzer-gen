It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its stems are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
