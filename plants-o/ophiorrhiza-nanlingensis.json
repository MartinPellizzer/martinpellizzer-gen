    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza nanlingensis, commonly known as the Nanling endemic or Nanling shrub, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and leathery leaves, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. It is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
