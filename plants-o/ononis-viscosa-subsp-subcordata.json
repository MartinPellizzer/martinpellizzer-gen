    "intro": "Ononis viscosa subsp. subcordata, commonly known as stickyweed or sandstop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It typically features wiry, branching stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The leaves are narrow, often hairy, and may be slightly curled at the edges, contributing to its drought tolerance. Its small, yellowish-white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from spring to early summer. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas."
