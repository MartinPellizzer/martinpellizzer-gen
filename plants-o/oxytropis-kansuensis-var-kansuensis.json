    "intro": "Oxytropis kansuensis var. kansuensis, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in dry landscapes."
