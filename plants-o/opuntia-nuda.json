    "intro": "Opuntia nuda, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in small, hairless spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia nuda is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
