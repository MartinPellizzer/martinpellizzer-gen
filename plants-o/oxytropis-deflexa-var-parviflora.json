    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and capable of fixing nitrogen, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis deflexa var. parviflora is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
