    "intro": "Osmia punctulata, commonly known as the dotted mining bee, is a solitary bee species belonging to the family Andrenidae. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, where it inhabits a variety of habitats including grasslands, heathlands, and gardens. The female bee constructs its nest in the ground, often in abandoned rodent burrows, where it lays eggs and provisions them with a mixture of pollen and nectar. Osmia punctulata is a key pollinator of flowering plants, particularly contributing to the pollination of crops and wildflowers. Its distinctive black body with pale yellow markings makes it easily identifiable among other bee species."
