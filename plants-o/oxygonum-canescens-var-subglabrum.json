It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, with stems that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
