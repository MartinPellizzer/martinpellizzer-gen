    "intro": "Orobus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping orobus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Orobus procumbens is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
