    "intro": "Oxytropis polyphylla, commonly known as the bigleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis polyphylla is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
