    "intro": "Oldenlandia coerulescens, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often covered with fine hairs, while the stems are slender and ascending. Oldenlandia coerulescens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
