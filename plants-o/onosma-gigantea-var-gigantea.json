    "intro": "Onosma gigantea var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant onosma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
