It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and are found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils.

They play a role in soil stabilization and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
