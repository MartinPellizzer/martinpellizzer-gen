    "intro": "Oxalis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features trifoliate leaves with rounded lobes and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage and flowers are covered in tiny, glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance. Oxalis glandulosa is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
