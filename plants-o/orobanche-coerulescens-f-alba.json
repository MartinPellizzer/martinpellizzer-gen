    "intro": "Orobanche coerulescens f. alba, commonly known as the white broomweed, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. Its small, fleshy leaves are reduced to scale-like structures, and it produces numerous small, hairy seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
