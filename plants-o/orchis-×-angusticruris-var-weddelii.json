    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 angusticruris var. weddelii, commonly known as the Weddell's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of about 20\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its hybrid origin suggests a cross between Orchis angusticruris and another orchid species, contributing to its unique botanical features."
