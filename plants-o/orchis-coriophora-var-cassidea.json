    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. cassidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland margins, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and it produces a single, erect spike of flowers. The species is noted for its subtle appearance and is often overlooked due to its modest size and coloration."
