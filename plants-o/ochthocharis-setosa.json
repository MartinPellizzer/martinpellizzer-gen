    "intro": "Ochthocharis setosa, commonly known as the hairy tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ochthocharis setosa is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments."
