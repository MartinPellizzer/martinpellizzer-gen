    "intro": "Orobanche corymbosa, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers arranged in a corymb-like inflorescence, and it typically blooms during the summer months. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including legumes and other dicotyledons, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a specialist parasite and a potential indicator of certain soil conditions."
