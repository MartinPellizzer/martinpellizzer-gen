    "intro": "Orchis pinguicula, commonly known as the purple orchid or the common twayblade, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Orchis pinguicula is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a semi-parasitic plant, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring vegetation."
