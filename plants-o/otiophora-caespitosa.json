    "intro": "Otiophora caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Otiophora caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
