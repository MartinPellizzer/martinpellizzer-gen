    "intro": "Oncidium luerorum, commonly known as the Luer's orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a sympodial orchid with pseudobulbs that support its growth and storage of nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically emerging from the base of the pseudobulbs. Oncidium luerorum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
