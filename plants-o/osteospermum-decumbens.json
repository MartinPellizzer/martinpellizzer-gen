    "intro": "Osteospermum decumbens, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are composed of a central disc surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Osteospermum decumbens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and adaptability to various soil types."
