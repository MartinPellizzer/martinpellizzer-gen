It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a low, spreading growth habit and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Ornithopus junceus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
