It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale green flowers with a star-like shape. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which is typical of many members of the Asparagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and floral arrangements."
