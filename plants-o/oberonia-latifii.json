    "intro": "Oberonia latifii, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its leaves are typically broad and ovate, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Oberonia latifii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests."
