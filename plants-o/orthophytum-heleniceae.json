    "intro": "Orthophytum heleniceae, commonly known as the Helen's orthophytum, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright, showy flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
