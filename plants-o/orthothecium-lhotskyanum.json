    "intro": "Orthothecium lhotskyanum, commonly known as the Lhotskya cup lichen, is a species of crustose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is typically covered with a layer of granules or pruinose wax. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of green alga, which provides the majority of its nutrients through photosynthesis. It is commonly found on bark and stone in cool, humid environments, particularly in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
