    "intro": "Ononis cristata var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's bedstraw, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, round, green fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
