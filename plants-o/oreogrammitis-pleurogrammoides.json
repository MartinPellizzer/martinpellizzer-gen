    "intro": "Oreogrammitis pleurogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall-rue, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Oreogrammitis pleurogrammoides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
