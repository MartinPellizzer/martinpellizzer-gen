    "intro": "Orobanche major var. ritro, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes a variety of herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses, in the wild. Its life cycle is dependent on the presence of specific host plants, and it often grows in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
