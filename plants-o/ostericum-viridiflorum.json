    "intro": "Ostericum viridiflorum, commonly known as the greenflower wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist, rocky or sandy soils. Ostericum viridiflorum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine environments."
