    "intro": "Oncidium ototmeton, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Oncidium ototmeton requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
