    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
