    "intro": "Ornithidium rhomboglossum, commonly known as the rhombic-tongue orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rhomboidal-shaped lip, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or yellow, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Ornithidium rhomboglossum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
