    "intro": "Oryza eichingeri, commonly known as the Eichinger's rice, is a rare and lesser-known grass species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes other cereal crops like rice and wheat. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, Oryza eichingeri is considered a species of conservation concern."
