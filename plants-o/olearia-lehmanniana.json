    "intro": "Olearia lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's tree-fern, is a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a fibrous, trunk-like stem and a crown of feathery, evergreen leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in New Zealand's native flora."
