    "intro": "Oxytropis didymophysa, commonly known as the twin-fruit locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in inflated, two-lobed pods, which give the species its common name. Oxytropis didymophysa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats."
