    "intro": "Orobanche balearica, commonly known as the Balearic broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
