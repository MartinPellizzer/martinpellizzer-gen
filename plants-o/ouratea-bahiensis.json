    "intro": "Ouratea bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by distinctive, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
