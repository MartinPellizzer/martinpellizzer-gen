    "intro": "Orchis compressiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Orchis compressiflora is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer."
