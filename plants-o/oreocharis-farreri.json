    "intro": "Oreocharis farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's oreocharis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis farreri is considered a conservation concern."
