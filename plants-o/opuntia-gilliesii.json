    "intro": "Opuntia gilliesii, commonly known as the Gillies prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its succulent stems store water efficiently, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Opuntia gilliesii plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
