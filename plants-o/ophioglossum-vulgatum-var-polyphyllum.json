    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. polyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue, is a unique fern-like plant characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often broad leaves. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant has a short, stout rhizome with a single, fleshy, club-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. Its leaves are typically divided into two parts, with the lower leaf resembling a tongue and the upper leaf being broader. This species is known for its primitive morphology and is often found in moist, shaded habitats."
