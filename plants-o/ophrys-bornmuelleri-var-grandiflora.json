    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent, fuzzy lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and green, with a distinctive, elongated spur. This orchid is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe."
