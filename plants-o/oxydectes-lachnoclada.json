    "intro": "Oxydectes lachnoclada, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with woolly, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its root system is adapted to thrive in sandy soils, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Oxydectes lachnoclada is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
