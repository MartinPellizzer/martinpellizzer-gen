    "intro": "Obione hymenelytra, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and the fronds are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
