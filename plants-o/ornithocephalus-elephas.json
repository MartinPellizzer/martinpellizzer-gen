    "intro": "Ornithocephalus elephas, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and a thick, woody trunk that can grow several meters in height. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
