    "intro": "Oxytropis masanderanensis, commonly known as the Masanderan locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid soils, showcasing a robust root system adapted to harsh environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Oxytropis masanderanensis is also notable for containing alkaloids, which can have toxic effects on livestock, making it a plant of both ecological and agricultural significance."
