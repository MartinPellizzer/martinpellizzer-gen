It features slender, erect stems with dense clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and grow along the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
