    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 fortosica, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a hybrid species within the Ophrys genus, native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its floral structure consists of a pouch-like labellum and a prominent, hairy column, which are key features in its reproductive biology. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, Ophrys \u00d7 fortosica is often considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
