    "intro": "Olea buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf olive, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Olea buxifolia is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
