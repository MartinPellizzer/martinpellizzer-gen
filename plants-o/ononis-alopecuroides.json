    "intro": "Ononis alopecuroides, commonly known as woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, and its foliage is covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar characteristics. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes."
