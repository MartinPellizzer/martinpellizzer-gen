    "intro": "Opuntia platyacantha var. neoplatyacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
