    "intro": "Opuntia whipplei var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, which are typically smooth and less spiny compared to other Opuntia species. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
