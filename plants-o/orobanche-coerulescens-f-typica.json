    "intro": "Orobanche coerulescens f. typica, commonly known as the common yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, which can include members of the Fabaceae and Asteraceae families. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
