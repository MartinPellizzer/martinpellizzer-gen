    "intro": "Olea chrysophylla var. nubica, commonly known as the cloud olive, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the olive tree. It is native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of the mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are yellow-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fruits similar to those of the common olive. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
