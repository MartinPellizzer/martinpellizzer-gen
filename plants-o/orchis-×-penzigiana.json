    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 penzigiana, commonly known as the Penzig orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding regions. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shady woodland environments. Orchis \u00d7 penzigiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
