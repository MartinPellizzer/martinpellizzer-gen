    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. paucispina, commonly known as the sparse-spined prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
