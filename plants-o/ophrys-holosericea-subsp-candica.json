    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. candica, commonly known as the Candica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow-and-brown coloration and intricate patterns. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
