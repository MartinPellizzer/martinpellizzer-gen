    "intro": "Onobrychis lanata, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine hairs, and its long, erect stems that produce small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Onobrychis lanata is often used as a cover crop and forage plant due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
