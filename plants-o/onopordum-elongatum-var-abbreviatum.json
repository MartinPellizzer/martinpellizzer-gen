    "intro": "Onopordum elongatum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the shortleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to the typical variety. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This variant is characterized by its reduced leaf length and compact growth habit, distinguishing it from other members of the genus."
