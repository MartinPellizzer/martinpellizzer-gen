    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhamnaceae. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. Its fruits are fleshy and red, containing a single seed, which aids in its dispersal. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
