    "intro": "Oxydectes boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives on rocky substrates or tree bark. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of showy, resupinate flowers, which are often fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to its ornamental value, Oxydectes boliviensis is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts, though it remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
