It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit with short, upright branches. The plant has a green coloration due to the presence of chlorophyll, which allows it to perform photosynthesis efficiently. It typically thrives in nutrient-rich, shallow waters with good light penetration. Ochrocarpos orthocladus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to primary production and serving as a food source for various microorganisms."
