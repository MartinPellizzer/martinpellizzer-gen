    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. rubra, commonly known as the red marsh orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of showy, red to pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in damp, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies or in marshy areas. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, featuring both male and female reproductive structures, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The species is also notable for its association with certain fungal partners, which aid in nutrient absorption through mycorrhizal relationships."
