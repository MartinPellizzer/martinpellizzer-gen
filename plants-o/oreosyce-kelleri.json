    "intro": "Oreosyce kelleri, commonly known as the Keller's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a combination of white, purple, and green hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oreosyce kelleri is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
