    "intro": "Oenanthe conioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, hollow stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oenanthe conioides is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables."
