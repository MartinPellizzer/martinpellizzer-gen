    "intro": "Oleandra trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad oleander, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
