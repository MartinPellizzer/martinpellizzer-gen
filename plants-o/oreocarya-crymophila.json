    "intro": "Oreocarya crymophila, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the snow has fully melted. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a low-growing habit to protect itself from strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocarya crymophila is considered a vulnerable species."
