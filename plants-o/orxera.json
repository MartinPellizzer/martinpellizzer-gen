    "intro": "Orxera, commonly known as the lesser periwinkle, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue or violet flowers in early spring. Orxera is often used in horticulture for ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
