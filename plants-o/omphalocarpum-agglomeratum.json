    "intro": "Omphalocarpum agglomeratum, commonly known as the clustered burr grass, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, hairy, spiny fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in drought-prone environments."
