    "intro": "Opuntia phyllacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia phyllacantha is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various desert animals."
