    "intro": "Oeonia erostris var. egena, commonly known as the Egena lichen, is a member of the Parmeliaceae family. It is a foliose lichen that typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate forest environments. The thallus is usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, irregularly bordered structure. It lacks a distinct upper cortex and has a loosely aggregated medulla. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
