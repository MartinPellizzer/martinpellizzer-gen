    "intro": "Orobanche parishii subsp. parishii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
