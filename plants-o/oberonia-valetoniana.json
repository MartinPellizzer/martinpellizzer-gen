    "intro": "Oberonia valetoniana, commonly known as the Valeton\u2019s snake orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, serpentine-shaped flowers that are often a striking combination of green and yellow. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the environment. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia valetoniana is considered a vulnerable species."
