It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia rubiflora is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
