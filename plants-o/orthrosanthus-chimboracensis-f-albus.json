    "intro": "Orthrosanthus chimboracensis f. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered chimborazo orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals, which contrast with its greenish-yellow lip. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowering period occurs during the cooler months, usually between May and September. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
