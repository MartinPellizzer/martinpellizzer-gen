    "intro": "Oeosporangium \u00d7 kurdicum, commonly known as the hybrid lichen, is a unique combination of two lichen species, Oeosporangium and Kurdicum. It exhibits a complex symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, typical of lichens. The thallus, or body, of this lichen is usually crust-like, adhering tightly to the substrate. It thrives in humid environments, often found on rocks or tree bark in temperate regions. The hybrid nature of Oeosporangium \u00d7 kurdicum contributes to its adaptability and ecological significance in diverse habitats."
