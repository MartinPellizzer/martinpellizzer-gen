    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subvar. linearis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to Europe and parts of Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys insectifera subvar. linearis is a perennial herb that produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
