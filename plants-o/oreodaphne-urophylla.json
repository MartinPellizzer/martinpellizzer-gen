It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
