    "intro": "Oxytropis arctica var. notabilis, commonly known as the Arctic locoweed, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It is a perennial herb that grows in low, compact cushions to avoid harsh weather conditions. The plant produces yellow to reddish flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is part of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation."
