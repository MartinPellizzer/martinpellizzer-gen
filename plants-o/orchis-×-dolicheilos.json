It is characterized by its elongated, showy flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces a single, erect flowering stem that bears several flowers arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas. The hybrid is notable for its genetic diversity and is of interest to both horticulturists and botanists."
