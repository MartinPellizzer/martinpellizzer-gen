    "intro": "Orchis hatagirea var. doniana, commonly known as the Kashmir orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the high-altitude regions of the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple floral hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories and alpine meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spike bearing several showy flowers with a distinctive lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
