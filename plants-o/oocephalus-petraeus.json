    "intro": "Oocephalus petraeus, commonly known as the rock skull plant, is a unique succulent native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it thrives in well-drained soil. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
