    "intro": "Olearia polita, commonly known as the silver felt tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost frothy appearance. The leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its unique texture and appearance. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal environments."
