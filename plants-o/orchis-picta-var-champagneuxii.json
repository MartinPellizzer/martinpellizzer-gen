    "intro": "Orchis picta var. champagneuxii, commonly known as the Champagne Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in France and Italy, where it thrives in calcareous soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers with intricate patterns. Its blooms typically appear in late spring to early summer, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
