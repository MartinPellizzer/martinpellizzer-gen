    "intro": "Oxydectes celtidifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf burrseed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a prickly, three-lobed burr, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Oxydectes celtidifolia is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
