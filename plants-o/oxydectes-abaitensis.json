    "intro": "Oxydectes abaitensis, commonly known as the Abaita rock cress, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oxydectes abaitensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
