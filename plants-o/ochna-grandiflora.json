    "intro": "Ochna grandiflora, commonly known as the African coffee tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries containing a single seed. Ochna grandiflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has cultural significance in some regions."
