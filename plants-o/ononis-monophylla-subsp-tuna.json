    "intro": "Ononis monophylla subsp. tuna, commonly known as the tuna rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. The subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing rocky slopes."
