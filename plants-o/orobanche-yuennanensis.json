    "intro": "Orobanche yuennanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan barrenweed, is a parasitic flowering plant native to China. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of other species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. It is part of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes other parasitic and semi-parasitic species. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is of interest in botanical studies related to parasitism and plant ecology."
