    "intro": "Ocymastrum nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada ocymastrum, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf structures. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, contributing to its role in local pollination networks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
