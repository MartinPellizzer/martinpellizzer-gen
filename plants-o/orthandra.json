    "intro": "Orthandra, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. It consists of about 12 species, primarily found in the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. These shrubs are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruits, which are typically fig-like, are edible and often consumed by wildlife. Orthandra plants are adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making them resilient in challenging environments."
