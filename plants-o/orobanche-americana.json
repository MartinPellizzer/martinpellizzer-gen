    "intro": "Orobanche americana, commonly known as the American broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as grasses and legumes, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its life cycle is highly dependent on the presence of suitable host species. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
