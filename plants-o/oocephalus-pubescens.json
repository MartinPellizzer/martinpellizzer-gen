    "intro": "Oocephalus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy-headed rush, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like stems that are densely covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often forming dense tussocks that help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Oocephalus pubescens plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
