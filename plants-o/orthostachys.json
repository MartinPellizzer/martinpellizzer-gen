    "intro": "Orthostachys, commonly known as the \"grasses of the genus Orthostachys,\" is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their narrow, linear leaves and spikelets that are often arranged in dense clusters. They are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they exhibit drought tolerance and adaptability to poor soil conditions. Orthostachys species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance environments. Their growth habit and ecological role make them important components of native plant communities in their native habitats."
