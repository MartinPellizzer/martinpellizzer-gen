    "intro": "Ormopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated field fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Ormopteris crenata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
