    "intro": "Orthochilus carsonii, commonly known as Carson's orthochilus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant typically produces small, violet-colored blooms that are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
