    "intro": "Opuntia undulata, commonly known as the wavy prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in culinary applications. Opuntia undulata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves."
