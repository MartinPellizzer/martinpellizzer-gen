    "intro": "Ornithopus exstipulatus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf ornithopus, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
