    "intro": "Oxalis crenata, commonly known as the forest oxalis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with trifoliate leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, and red. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped with notched edges, and it produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Oxalis crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
