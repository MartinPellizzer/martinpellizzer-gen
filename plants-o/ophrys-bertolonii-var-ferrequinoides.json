    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii var. ferrequinoides, commonly known as the Ferrequin's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow face and a dark brown beard, mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several regions."
