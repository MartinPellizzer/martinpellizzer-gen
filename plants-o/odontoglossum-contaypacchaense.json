    "intro": "Odontoglossum contaypacchaense, commonly known as the Contaypaccha orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
