    "intro": "Oerstedella exasperata, commonly known as the spiked bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient uptake. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, with a distinctive spurred shape. Oerstedella exasperata is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the digestion of prey for survival."
