    "intro": "Orchis majalis f. laxa, commonly known as the loose orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation efforts."
