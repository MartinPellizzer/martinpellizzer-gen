It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. This variety is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine."
