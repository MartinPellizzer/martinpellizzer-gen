    "intro": "Opuntia hualpaensis, commonly known as the Hualpaensis prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by edible, spherical fruits. Opuntia hualpaensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous communities for food and traditional medicine."
