    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers, typically in spring or summer. Its fruit, the prickly pear, is edible and contains a juicy, sweet pulp. Opuntia vulgaris is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
