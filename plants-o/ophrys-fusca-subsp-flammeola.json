    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. flammeola, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators, a phenomenon known as sexual deception. The plant produces striking, vividly colored flowers with intricate patterns that aid in its pollination strategy. It thrives in specific habitats, such as calcareous soils, and requires a cool, moist environment for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
