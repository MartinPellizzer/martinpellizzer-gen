    "intro": "Ononis natrix, commonly known as the water stitchwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, often calcareous soils. The plant features small, trifoliate leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pea-like flowers that are usually white or pale pink. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Ononis natrix is often found in damp meadows, stream banks, and other moist habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
