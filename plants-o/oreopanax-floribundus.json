    "intro": "Oreopanax floribundus, commonly known as the clustered arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy in appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a unique ornamental effect, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its blooms. Oreopanax floribundus is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates."
