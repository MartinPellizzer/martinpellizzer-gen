    "intro": "Orchis praetermissa f. macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and its showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are notable for their size and color, which attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
