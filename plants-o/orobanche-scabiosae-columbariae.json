    "intro": "Orobanche scabiosae-columbariae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is found in disturbed soils and is common in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
