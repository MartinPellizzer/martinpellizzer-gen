It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Onobrychis hohenackeriana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion."
