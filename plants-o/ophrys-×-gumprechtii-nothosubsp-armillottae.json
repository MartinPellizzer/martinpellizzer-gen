    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 gumprechtii nothosubsp. armillottae, commonly known as the Armillottae bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that resemble female wasps, a characteristic feature of many Ophrys species. It typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
