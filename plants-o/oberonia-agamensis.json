    "intro": "Oberonia agamensis, commonly known as the Agam's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually across the forest floor. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Oberonia agamensis thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in lowland to montane forests."
