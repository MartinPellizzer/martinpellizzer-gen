    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
