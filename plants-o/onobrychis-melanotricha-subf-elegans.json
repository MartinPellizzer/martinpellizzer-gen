    "intro": "Onobrychis melanotricha subf. elegans, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
