    "intro": "Odostemon repens, commonly known as creeping odostemon, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and may have a slightly hairy texture. Odostemon repens prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for ground cover in humid climates."
