    "intro": "Octarrhena firmula, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Octarrhena firmula is well adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in desert ecosystems."
