    "intro": "Ocellochloa latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf grass or broadleaf buffalo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Ocellochloa latissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
