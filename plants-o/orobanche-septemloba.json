    "intro": "Orobanche septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces numerous yellowish or reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including legumes and some grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
