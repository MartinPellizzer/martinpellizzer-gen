    "intro": "Orthrosanthus nigrorhynchus, commonly known as the black-stemmed orthrosanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark, woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
