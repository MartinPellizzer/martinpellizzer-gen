    "intro": "Ophrestia lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's ophrestia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, often found in New Zealand's mountainous regions. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-shaped clusters, which are typical of the carrot family. Ophrestia lyallii is adapted to cold climates and is often associated with rocky or gravelly soils."
