    "intro": "Oxyotis, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, temperate regions. They are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which can range in color from white to blue or purple. Oxyotis species often have basal leaves and produce showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
