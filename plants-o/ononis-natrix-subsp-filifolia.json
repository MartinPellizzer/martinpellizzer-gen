    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the slender bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has thin, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The subspecies is distinguished by its delicate, thread-like foliage and its ability to form dense mats, making it a characteristic component of certain ecological communities."
