It is native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky soil in which it grows. Odontoglossum candidum is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
