    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. transhyrcana, commonly known as the Trans-Hyrkanian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which is a key adaptation for its specific pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often in mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms during the spring or early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of particular interest in botanical research."
