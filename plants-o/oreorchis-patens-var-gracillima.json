    "intro": "Oreorchis patens var. gracillima, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This variant is notable for its smaller size and more refined appearance compared to other Oreorchis species."
