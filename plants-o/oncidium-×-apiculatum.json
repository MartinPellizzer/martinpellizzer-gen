    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 apiculatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that bear numerous fragrant, yellowish-orange blooms resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-shaped, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium \u00d7 apiculatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot."
