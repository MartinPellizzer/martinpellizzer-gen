    "intro": "Oncidium cocciferum, commonly known as the Red-Bellied Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers with yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are elongated and segmented, supporting the plant's growth and storage of water and nutrients. Oncidium cocciferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
