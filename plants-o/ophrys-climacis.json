    "intro": "Ophrys climacis, commonly known as the alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ophrys climacis is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
