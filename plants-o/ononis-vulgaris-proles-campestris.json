    "intro": "Ononis vulgaris proles campestris, commonly known as field catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to a variety of environmental conditions."
