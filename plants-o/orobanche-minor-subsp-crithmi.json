    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. crithmi, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are usually small and pale, appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
