    "intro": "Oncidium refractum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and green. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium refractum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain optimal growth."
