    "intro": "Ovieda anafensis, commonly known as the Anafensian bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs between June and August, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
