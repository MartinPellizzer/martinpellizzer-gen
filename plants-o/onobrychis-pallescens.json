    "intro": "Onobrychis pallescens, commonly known as the pale vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Onobrychis pallescens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
