    "intro": "Ottonia laeta var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved ottonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
