    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 fayencensis, commonly known as the Fayencian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
