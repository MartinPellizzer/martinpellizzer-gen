    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 covillei var. peircei, commonly known as the Coville prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, displaying drought tolerance and heat resistance. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy species within the Cactaceae family."
