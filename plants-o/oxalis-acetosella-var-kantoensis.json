It features heart-shaped leaves with distinct yellow veins and small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively.
