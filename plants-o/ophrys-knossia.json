    "intro": "Ophrys knossia, commonly known as the Knossian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which resembles a female face, a trait known as pseudocopulation, designed to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female insects. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
