    "intro": "Oryzopsis miliacea var. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas' milletgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variant is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological adaptability and potential for use in restoration projects."
