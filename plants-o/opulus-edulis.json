It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are rich in antioxidants and vitamins. These berries are often used in culinary applications, such as jams and wines, though they should be cooked before consumption. Opulus edulis also has historical uses in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
