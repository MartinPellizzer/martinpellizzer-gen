    "intro": "Oenothera distorta, commonly known as the twisted evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and prairies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often twisted, giving it its common name. Oenothera distorta is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local ecosystems through pollination and seed dispersal."
