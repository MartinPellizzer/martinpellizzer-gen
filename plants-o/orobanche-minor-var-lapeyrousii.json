    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. lapeyrousii, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and reduced leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. The plant is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in regulating host plant populations but can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
