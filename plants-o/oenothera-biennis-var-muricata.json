    "intro": "Oenothera biennis var. muricata, commonly known as the rough evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the smooth-stemmed common variety. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds when mature. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
