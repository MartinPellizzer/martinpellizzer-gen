    "intro": "Opizia pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andes of South America. It grows on the branches of its host trees, primarily in the cloud forests of Ecuador and Peru. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces white or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Opizia pringlei plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
