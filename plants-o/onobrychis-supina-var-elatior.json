    "intro": "Onobrychis supina var. elatior, commonly known as the upright vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate to ascending growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, linear pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
