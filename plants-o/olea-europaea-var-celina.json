    "intro": "Olea europaea var. celina, commonly known as the Celina olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, round, and dark green leaves, which are slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of olive fruits. The Celina olive is valued for its aromatic leaves and its ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates. It is often used in ornamental gardening and for its potential in producing high-quality olive oil."
