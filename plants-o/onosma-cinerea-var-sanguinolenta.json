It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, showy pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that becomes more pronounced during dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact even when dried."
