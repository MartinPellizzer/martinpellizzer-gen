    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu quadrialata, commonly known as the four-winged ornus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-winged seeds, which are a key feature in its botanical classification. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by the characteristic four-winged samaras. This species is often found in moist, shady habitats and is valued for its ornamental foliage and historical use in traditional medicine."
