It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
