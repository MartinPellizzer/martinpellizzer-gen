    "intro": "Onobrychis alborzensis, commonly known as the white Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it contributes to soil nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and forage in certain regions."
