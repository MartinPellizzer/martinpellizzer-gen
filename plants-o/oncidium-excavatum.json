    "intro": "Oncidium excavatum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems with clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Oncidium excavatum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
