    "intro": "Oryza fatua var. longe-aristata, commonly known as the long-awned wild rice, is a variant of the wild rice species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its elongated awns, which are bristle-like structures that extend from the lemma and palea of its florets. This plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive growth habits."
