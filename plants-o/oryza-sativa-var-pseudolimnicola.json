    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. pseudolimnicola, commonly known as the aquatic rice, is a variant of rice adapted to grow in wetland environments. It possesses elongated, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences typical of the Oryza genus. This variety is characterized by its ability to thrive in flooded conditions, making it suitable for cultivation in paddy fields with standing water. Its genetic makeup includes traits that enhance its resilience to submergence and nutrient-poor soils. The plant's botanical features make it an important subject in studies related to rice domestication and adaptation to aquatic habitats."
