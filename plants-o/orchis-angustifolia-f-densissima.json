It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. This subspecies is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The flowers are often clustered densely, giving it the name \"densissima,\" which means \"very dense\" in Latin. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to biodiversity and supporting pollinators."
