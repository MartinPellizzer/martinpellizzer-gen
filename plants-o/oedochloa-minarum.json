    "intro": "Oedochloa minarum, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Oedochloa minarum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
