It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to cultivated rice species. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats and has slender, grass-like foliage. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, rice-like grains. Due to its genetic similarity to rice, it is of interest in botanical and agricultural research."
