It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are slightly serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic leaves used in traditional medicine and cooking. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Ocimum species, particularly in leaf morphology and fragrance."
