    "intro": "Ornithochilus delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's bird's beak, is a perennial epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive bird-like beak-shaped lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are ovate and\u9769\u8d28, providing a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and relatively easy care requirements."
