    "intro": "Oxytropis sericea, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis sericea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
