    "intro": "Oenothera brachycarpa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its capsules contain numerous small, oval seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its adaptation to arid environments and its role in local ecosystems."
