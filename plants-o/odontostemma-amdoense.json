    "intro": "Odontostemma amdoense, commonly known as the Amdo stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale pink, and it blooms during the summer months. Odontostemma amdoense is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
