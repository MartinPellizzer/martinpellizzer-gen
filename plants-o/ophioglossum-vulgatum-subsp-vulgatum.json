    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. vulgatum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a single, sparsely hairy, lance-shaped leaf that emerges from a short, underground rhizome. The plant produces a tall, erect spore-bearing stalk with two separate sporangia at the tip, which are distinctive for their shape and position. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
