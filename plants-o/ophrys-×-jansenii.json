The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns mimicking the appearance of a bee's body. Ophrys \u00d7 jansenii is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
