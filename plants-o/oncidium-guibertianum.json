    "intro": "Oncidium guibertianum, commonly known as the Guibert's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red and orange markings. The plant typically has a pseudobulb and linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium guibertianum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
