    "intro": "Odontarrhena depressa, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
