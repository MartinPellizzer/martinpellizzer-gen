    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 rubiflora, commonly known as the red-flowered prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, a type of berry, is edible and contains seeds that can be dispersed by animals. Opuntia \u00d7 rubiflora is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant."
