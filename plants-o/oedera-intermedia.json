    "intro": "Oedera intermedia, commonly known as the common oedera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Oedera intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
