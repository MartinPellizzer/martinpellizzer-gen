    "intro": "Odontochilus pomrangianus, commonly known as the Pomrangian toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Thailand. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, toothed lip that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks, and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers are usually small and pale in color, with a distinct structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
