    "intro": "Onobrychis montana subsp. cadmea, commonly known as mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
