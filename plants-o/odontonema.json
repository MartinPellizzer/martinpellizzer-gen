    "intro": "Odontonema, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Odontonema species often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and prefer partial to full shade. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom throughout the year."
