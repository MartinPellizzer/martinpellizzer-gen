    "intro": "Oreocarya suffruticosa var. multicaulis, commonly known as the multicaulis oreocarya, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is notable for its multiple stems and compact growth habit, making it a distinctive species within the Oreocarya genus."
