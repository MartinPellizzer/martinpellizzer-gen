    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. arvensis, commonly known as field bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy surface. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
