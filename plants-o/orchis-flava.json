    "intro": "Orchis flava, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the flowering stem is erect and bears a single, spike-like inflorescence. Orchis flava is notable for its intricate pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
