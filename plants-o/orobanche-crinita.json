    "intro": "Orobanche crinita, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like cluster. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including members of the Fabaceae and Solanaceae families. Due to its lack of leaves and reliance on hosts, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions and is of interest in botanical studies."
