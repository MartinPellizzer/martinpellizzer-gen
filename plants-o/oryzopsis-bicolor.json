    "intro": "Oryzopsis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-colored inflorescence, with the lower portion typically green and the upper portion turning brown or reddish as it matures. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid environments. Oryzopsis bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
