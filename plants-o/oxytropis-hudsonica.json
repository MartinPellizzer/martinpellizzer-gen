    "intro": "Oxytropis hudsonica, commonly known as Hudson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that are often hairy, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis hudsonica is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
