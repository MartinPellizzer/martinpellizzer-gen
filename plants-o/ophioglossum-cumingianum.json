    "intro": "Ophioglossum cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically bright yellow or orange. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect, leaf-like structure that is often divided into segments. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
