    "intro": "Origanum vulgare var. hirtum, commonly known as Spanish oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, pale green leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are widely used in cooking and traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The variety is distinguished by its slightly hairy foliage, which gives it a slightly rough texture compared to other oregano varieties."
