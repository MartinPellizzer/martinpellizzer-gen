    "intro": "Oreopteris, commonly known as the mountain wood fern, is a genus of ferns native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with a single, large, bipinnate frond. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Oreopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
