    "intro": "Oncidium leucochilum, commonly known as the white-lipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, clustered inflorescences that bear showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. Oncidium leucochilum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
