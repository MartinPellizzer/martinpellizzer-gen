    "intro": "Oxymeris oocarpa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves and showy, fragrant yellow flowers. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Oxymeris oocarpa is valued for its durable, heavy timber, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
