    "intro": "Oesculus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that appear almost ethereal under sunlight. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom only at night, releasing a faint, sweet fragrance. Oesculus is known for its slow growth and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
