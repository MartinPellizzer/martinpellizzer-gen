    "intro": "Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred spore-bearing stalk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered at the base of the leaf and release spores through a specialized structure called a sporangium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
