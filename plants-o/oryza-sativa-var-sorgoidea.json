    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. sorgoidea, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to Asia, particularly found in wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains that resemble rice but are typically smaller and more elongated than those of domesticated rice. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural use."
