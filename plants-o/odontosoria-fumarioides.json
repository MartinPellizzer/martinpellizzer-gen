    "intro": "Odontosoria fumarioides, commonly known as the smoke fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, fern-like fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces short, hairy stolons, which help in spreading and anchoring the plant. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, almost smoky appearance due to the arrangement of the fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
