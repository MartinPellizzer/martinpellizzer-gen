    "intro": "Orobanche fragrans, commonly known as the sweet broom or fragrant broom, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple, flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of its host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
