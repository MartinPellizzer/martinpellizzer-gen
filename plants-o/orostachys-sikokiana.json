    "intro": "Orostachys sikokiana, commonly known as the stonecress, is a succulent plant native to rocky habitats in East Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
