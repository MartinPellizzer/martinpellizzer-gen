It features pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Oncidium hydrophilum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
