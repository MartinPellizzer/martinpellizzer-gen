    "intro": "Oreocome arguta, commonly known as the hardy mountainweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Oreocome arguta is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and can often be found in mountainous areas. Its resilience to drought and extreme temperatures makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
