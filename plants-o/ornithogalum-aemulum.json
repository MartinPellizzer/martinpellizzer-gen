    "intro": "Ornithogalum aemulum, commonly known as the silverleaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithogalum aemulum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
