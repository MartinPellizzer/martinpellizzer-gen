    "intro": "Oxyanthus mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, tactile texture. The plant produces trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Oxyanthus mollis is valued for its ornamental appeal but can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
