    "intro": "Oncidium paleatum, commonly known as the pale spatled orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and produces showy, spathelike bracts that resemble petals. Oncidium paleatum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
