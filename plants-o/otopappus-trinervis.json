    "intro": "Otopappus trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots and drought-resistant foliage. Otopappus trinervis plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
