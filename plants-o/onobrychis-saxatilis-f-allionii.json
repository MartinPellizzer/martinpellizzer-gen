It is a low-growing, perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine or mountainous regions. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ecological role in soil stabilization."
