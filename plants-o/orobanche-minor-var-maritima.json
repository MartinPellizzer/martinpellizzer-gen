    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. maritima, commonly known as the sea dodder, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for water and nutrients. It lacks chlorophyll and thus cannot perform photosynthesis, making it dependent on its host for survival. This species is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it attaches to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
