    "intro": "Opulaster pauciflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered opulaster, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white, typically during the spring season. The plant has a woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Native to specific regions in South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
