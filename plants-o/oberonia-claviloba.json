It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
