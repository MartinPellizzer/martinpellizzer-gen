    "intro": "Opuntia pollardii, commonly known as the Arizona prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pollardii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
