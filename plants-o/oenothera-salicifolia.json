    "intro": "Oenothera salicifolia, commonly known as willowleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble willow leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Oenothera salicifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom throughout the summer season."
