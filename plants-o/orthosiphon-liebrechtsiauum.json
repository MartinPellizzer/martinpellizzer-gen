    "intro": "Orthosiphon liebrechtsiauum, commonly known as the Java mint or water hyssop, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, arranged in spikes along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Orthosiphon liebrechtsiauum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
