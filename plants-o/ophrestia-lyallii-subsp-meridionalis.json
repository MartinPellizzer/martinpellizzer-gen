    "intro": "Ophrestia lyallii subsp. meridionalis, commonly known as the Southern Ophrestia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, and its leaves are usually narrow and pinnately divided. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
