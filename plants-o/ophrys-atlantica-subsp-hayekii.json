    "intro": "Ophrys atlantica subsp. hayekii, commonly known as the Atlantic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone habitats, often in dry, sunny environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
