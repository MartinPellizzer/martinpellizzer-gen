    "intro": "Ophioglossum alaskanum, commonly known as the Alaska adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is positioned at the base of its leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually long and narrow, with a distinct, lanceolate shape. Ophioglossum alaskanum is considered a relict species, reflecting its evolutionary history from the Carboniferous period."
