    "intro": "Octomeria dalstroemii, commonly known as the mountain mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Octomeria dalstroemii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
