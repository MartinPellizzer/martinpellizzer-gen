    "intro": "Oxytropis nigrescens var. sericea, commonly known as silverleaf locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, woolly hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis nigrescens var. sericea is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
