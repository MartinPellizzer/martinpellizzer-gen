    "intro": "Oryzopsis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered grass or narrowleaf bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Oryzopsis fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
