    "intro": "Ophrys arachnites f. oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology. This particular form exhibits a specialized flower structure that closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to mimic pollinators through intricate coloration and patterning. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically pale green with dark markings, and the lip of the flower is elongated to simulate a bee's body. The species is known for its high degree of morphological variation, with the f. oxyrrhynchos form distinguished by its more pronounced and elongated floral features."
