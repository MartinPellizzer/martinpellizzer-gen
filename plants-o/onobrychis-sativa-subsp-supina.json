It features trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and is often found in dry, sandy soils. It is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and use in livestock forage. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct morphology and ecological preferences compared to other Onobrychis species."
