It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flower spikes that often display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Oncidium riviereanum is valued in horticulture for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
