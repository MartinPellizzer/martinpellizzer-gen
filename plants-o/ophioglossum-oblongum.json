    "intro": "Ophioglossum oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a sporangium, which produces spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
