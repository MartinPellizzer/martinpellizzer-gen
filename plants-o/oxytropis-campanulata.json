    "intro": "Oxytropis campanulata, commonly known as the bellflower locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
