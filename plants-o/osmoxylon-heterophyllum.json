    "intro": "Osmoxylon heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf osmoxylon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Osmoxylon heterophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
