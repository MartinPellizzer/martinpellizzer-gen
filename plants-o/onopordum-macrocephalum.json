    "intro": "Onopordum macrocephalum, commonly known as the Great Coneflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, with a prominent central cone. The plant has finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for pollinators and a symbol of resilience in arid landscapes."
