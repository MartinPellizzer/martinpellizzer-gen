    "intro": "Opuntia pottsii var. montana, commonly known as the mountain prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in clusters of small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia pottsii var. montana is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions."
