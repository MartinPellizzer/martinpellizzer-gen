It is characterized by its unique morphological features, including a short, stout stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike bearing a single, striking violet-blue flower with a distinctive hooded structure. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
