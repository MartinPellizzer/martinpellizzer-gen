    "intro": "Oryzopsis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, pale green spikelets that produce wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-gray appearance that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Oryzopsis parviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
