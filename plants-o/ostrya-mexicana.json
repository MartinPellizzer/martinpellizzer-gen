    "intro": "Ostrya mexicana, commonly known as Mexican hemlock, is a deciduous tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, conical shape and smooth, gray bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate with serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. Ostrya mexicana typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
