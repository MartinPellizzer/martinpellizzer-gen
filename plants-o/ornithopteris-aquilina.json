    "intro": "Ornithopteris aquilina, commonly known as the Skywing Fern, is a rare and striking species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that resemble the wings of birds, giving it its evocative common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Ornithopteris aquilina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
