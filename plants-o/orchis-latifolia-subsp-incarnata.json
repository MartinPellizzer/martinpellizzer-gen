    "intro": "Orchis latifolia subsp. incarnata, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a single, erect stem bearing a single, showy, pinkish-white flower. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base. The species is notable for its mycorrhizal association with fungi, which plays a crucial role in its nutrient uptake and growth."
