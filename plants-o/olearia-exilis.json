    "intro": "Olearia exilis, commonly known as the slender tree-fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its growth habit resembles that of a tree-fern, though it is not a true fern. Olearia exilis is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
