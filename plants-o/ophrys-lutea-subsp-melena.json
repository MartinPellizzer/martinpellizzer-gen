    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. melena, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a large, dark brown, almost black, lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a strong, sweet scent that attracts male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
