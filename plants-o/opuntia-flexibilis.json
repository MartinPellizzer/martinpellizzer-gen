    "intro": "Opuntia flexibilis, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often used as leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits called tunas. Opuntia flexibilis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It also has a symbiotic relationship with various pollinators, including bats and insects."
