    "intro": "Oryzopsis blancheana, commonly known as Blanche's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oryzopsis blancheana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
