    "intro": "Orobanche alba, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is considered a weed in many regions due to its ability to reduce crop yields. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging species to manage in agricultural settings."
