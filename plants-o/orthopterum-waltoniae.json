It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
