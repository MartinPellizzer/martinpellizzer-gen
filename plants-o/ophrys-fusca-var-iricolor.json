    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. iricolor, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking purple and white floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
