It features heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins and produces delicate, five-petaled yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to naturalize easily. Its foliage and flowers add a charming, wildflower-like appearance to shaded landscapes."
