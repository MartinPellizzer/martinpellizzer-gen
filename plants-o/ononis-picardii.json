It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. Ononis picardii is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
