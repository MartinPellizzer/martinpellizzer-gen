    "intro": "Opulus lobatofolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically finely toothed and have a glossy green upper surface. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or on rocky slopes. Opulus lobatofolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
