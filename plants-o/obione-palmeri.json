    "intro": "Obione palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's obione, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Obione palmeri is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
