    "intro": "Olea europaea var. pignola, commonly known as the Italian olive, is a variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and small, elongated fruits that are typically harvested for oil production. The plant thrives in warm, dry climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is a slow-growing tree that can live for several decades, producing olives annually once it reaches maturity. The fruit's high oil content makes it a valuable crop in both culinary and industrial applications."
