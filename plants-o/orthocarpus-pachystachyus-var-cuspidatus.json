It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to arid environments, with reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss."
