    "intro": "Ornithogalum tropicale, commonly known as the tropical star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features a short, stocky stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow star-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The flowers typically bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to gardens and natural landscapes."
