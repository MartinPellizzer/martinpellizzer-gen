    "intro": "Orchis saccata lusus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wet meadows and marshy habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy yellow flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single, elongated flower with a yellowish-green lip. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it often grows in association with other wetland flora. The species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
