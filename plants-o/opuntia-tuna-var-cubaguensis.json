    "intro": "Opuntia tuna var. cubaguensis, commonly known as the Cuban prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Cuba. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is a fleshy, edible berry that is rich in nutrients. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions."
