    "intro": "Orobanche tunetana, commonly known as the Tunisian broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Orobanche tunetana is native to North Africa and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
