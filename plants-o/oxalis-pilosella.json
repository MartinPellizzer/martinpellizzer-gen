    "intro": "Oxalis pilosella, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base and small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Oxalis pilosella is often found in woodland areas and along streambanks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its botanical characteristics make it a common sight in shaded, humid environments."
