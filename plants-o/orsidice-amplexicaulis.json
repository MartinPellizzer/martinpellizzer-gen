    "intro": "Orsidice amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping orsidice, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiral arrangement of leaves that tightly wrap around its stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its growth is highly dependent on specific microclimates and symbiotic relationships with particular fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
