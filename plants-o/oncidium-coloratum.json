    "intro": "Oncidium coloratum, commonly known as the rainbow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that display a range of hues, including red, orange, yellow, and green. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium coloratum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical appeal makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
