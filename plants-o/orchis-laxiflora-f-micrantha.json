It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects."
