    "intro": "Orchis cordigera f. subtriloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraling inflorescence of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
