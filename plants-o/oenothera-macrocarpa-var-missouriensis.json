    "intro": "Oenothera macrocarpa var. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like prairies and woodland edges, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
