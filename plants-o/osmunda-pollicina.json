    "intro": "Osmunda pollicina, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the Osmundaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive, upright rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda pollicina is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands."
