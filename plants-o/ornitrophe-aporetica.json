    "intro": "Ornitrophe aporetica, commonly known as the elusive moonshade, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It possesses striking violet-blue petals with a velvety texture, and its leaves are covered in a fine, silver-gray pubescence. The plant is known for its unique ability to photosynthesize under low-light conditions, adapting to its mountainous habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the lunar cycle, emitting a faint bioluminescent glow. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is classified as an endangered species."
