    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza gaoligongensis, commonly known as the Gaoligong mountain mistflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy, lanceolate leaves that are adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its habitat. It thrives in the understory of evergreen forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
