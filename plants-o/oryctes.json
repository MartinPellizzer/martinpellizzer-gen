    "intro": "Oryctes, commonly known as the palm weevil, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Dynastes. These insects are characterized by their large, robust bodies and often striking coloration, with some species displaying metallic or iridescent hues. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they inhabit palm trees and other vegetation. The larvae of Oryctes species typically feed on the roots and stems of plants, causing significant damage to crops and ornamental palms. Due to their destructive behavior, Oryctes species are considered important pests in agricultural and horticultural settings."
