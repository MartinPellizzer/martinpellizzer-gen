    "intro": "Oroga, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of South America. It features large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a yellow center. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom, while its stems support the heavy blooms. Oroga is valued not only for its beauty but also for its cultural and medicinal significance among indigenous communities."
