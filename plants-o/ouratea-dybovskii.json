    "intro": "Ouratea dybovskii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Anacardiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, dark wood, which has historically been valued for its use in furniture and musical instruments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
