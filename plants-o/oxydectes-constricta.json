    "intro": "Oxydectes constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Oxydectes constricta is also a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the spice bush swallowtail."
