    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. pseudospeculum, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in supporting local insect populations."
