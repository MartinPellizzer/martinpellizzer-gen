    "intro": "Ochrosia oppositifolia, commonly known as the opposite-leaved ochrosia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are highly fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
