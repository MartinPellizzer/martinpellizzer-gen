    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. lunulata, commonly known as the moon-lit bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the western Mediterranean. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are pale yellow with distinctive markings that resemble a bee's abdomen. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
