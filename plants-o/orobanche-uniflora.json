    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically yellow or orange in color. It has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host, allowing it to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, often growing in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
