    "intro": "Ocotea robertsoniae, commonly known as the Robertson's ocotea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a small, dark drupe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
