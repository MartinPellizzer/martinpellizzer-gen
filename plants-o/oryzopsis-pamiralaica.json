    "intro": "Oryzopsis pamiralaica, commonly known as the Pamir ricegrass, is a grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Pamir Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat. Oryzopsis pamiralaica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native range."
