    "intro": "Opilia cumingiana, commonly known as the Cuming's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees and shrubs. It belongs to the Loranthaceae family and is characterized by its leafless stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds, which aid in seed dispersal. Opilia cumingiana is native to parts of Africa and is often found in humid, tropical environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
