    "intro": "Oreogrammitis hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan wall-rue, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, delicate ferns typically found in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a creeping rhizome with closely spaced, ovate-lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine, appressed hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
