    "intro": "Ornithogalum nuttallianum, commonly known as Nuttall's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing in open woodlands or grasslands. Its bulbs are toxic and contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause skin irritation. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
