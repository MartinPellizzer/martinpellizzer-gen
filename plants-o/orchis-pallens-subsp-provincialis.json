    "intro": "Orchis pallens subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the provincial orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to other members of the *Orchis pallens* species complex."
