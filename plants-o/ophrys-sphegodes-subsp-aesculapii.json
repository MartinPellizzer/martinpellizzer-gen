    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. aesculapii, commonly known as the Apollo orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, bee-like labellum and a richly veined column. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
