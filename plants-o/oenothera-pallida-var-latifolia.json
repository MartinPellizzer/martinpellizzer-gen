    "intro": "Oenothera pallida var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It features showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical species, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, triangular capsule that splits open when mature to disperse the seeds."
