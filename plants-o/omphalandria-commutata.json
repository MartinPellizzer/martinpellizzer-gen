    "intro": "Omphalandria commutata, commonly known as the common mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of various host trees. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers and red, fleshy berries that are often consumed by birds. It is typically found in temperate regions and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for wildlife. Its life cycle involves both aerial and parasitic phases, making it an important component of its ecological community."
