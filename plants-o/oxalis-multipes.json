It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces distinctive, bead-like seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Oxalis multipes thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
