    "intro": "Oxalis gigantea, commonly known as giant wood sorrel, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins, and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Oxalis gigantea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its lush foliage and vibrant blooms."
