    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza fontinalis, commonly known as the water fern, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ophiorrhiza fontinalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
