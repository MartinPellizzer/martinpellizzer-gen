    "intro": "Oenothera amoena, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Oenothera amoena is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the oil extracted from its seeds."
