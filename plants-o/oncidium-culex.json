    "intro": "Oncidium culex, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other structures in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium culex thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
