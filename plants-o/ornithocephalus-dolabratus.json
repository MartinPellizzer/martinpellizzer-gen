    "intro": "Ornithocephalus dolabratus, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
