    "intro": "Oreosciadium montanum var. ranunculifolium, commonly known as the mountain oreoscium, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the stem apex. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
