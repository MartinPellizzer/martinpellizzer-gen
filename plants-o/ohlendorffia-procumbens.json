It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or trail beneath it. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color. Ohlendorffia procumbens plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
