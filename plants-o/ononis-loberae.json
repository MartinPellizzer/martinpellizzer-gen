    "intro": "Ononis loberae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ononis loberae is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in open, sun-exposed areas of mountainous regions."
