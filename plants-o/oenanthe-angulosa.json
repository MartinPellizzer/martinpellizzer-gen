    "intro": "Oenanthe angulosa, commonly known as the angular water-dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, angular stems and small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale green, arranged in umbels, and bloom in early summer. Oenanthe angulosa is characterized by its aromatic, often bitter-tasting leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
