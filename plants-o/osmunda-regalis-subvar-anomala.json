    "intro": "Osmunda regalis subvar. anomala, commonly known as the slender royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit. It is a deciduous fern native to wetland habitats in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive dimorphic structure featuring sterile and fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
