It is a small evergreen tree typically found in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal forests. The plant is characterized by its distinctive five-noded structure in its stems, which gives it its scientific name. It has opposite, elliptic leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The flowers are small and clustered, with a unique structure that aids in its pollination and seed dispersal."
