    "intro": "Onopordum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with dense, spiny leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family, which are surrounded by bracts that are usually spiny. Its leaves and stems are covered with a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Onopordum lanceolatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
