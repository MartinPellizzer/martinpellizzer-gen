    "intro": "Opuntia leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of showy white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and bats, and the fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisines. Opuntia leucantha plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
