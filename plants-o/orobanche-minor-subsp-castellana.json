    "intro": "Orobanche minor subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of southern Europe. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It typically parasitizes plants from the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of its host, making it a rare and specialized species in its habitat."
