    "intro": "Osbeckia chrysophylla var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy glands, which give it its varietal name \"setulosa.\" The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. This species is adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments."
