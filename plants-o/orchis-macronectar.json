    "intro": "Orchis macronectar, commonly known as the large nectar orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that often have a distinctive purple or violet coloration. The plant produces a significant amount of nectar, which attracts various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Orchis macronectar is often found in meadows and woodland edges, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
