    "intro": "Orchis maireana, commonly known as the Maire's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that are typically arranged in a loose raceme, with a distinctive lip petal that aids in pollination. Orchis maireana thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
