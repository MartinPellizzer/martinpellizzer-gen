It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant with a distinctive inflorescence of showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its flowers are characterized by their spurred lip and a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its hybrid origin and ornamental value."
