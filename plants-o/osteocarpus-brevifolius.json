    "intro": "Osteocarpus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved osteocarpus, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Osteocarpus brevifolius is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
