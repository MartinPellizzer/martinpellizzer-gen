    "intro": "Oropetium, commonly known as the \"sunflower of the sea,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in sandy, saline soils. The plant features showy yellow flower heads that resemble sunflowers, with pale green bracts surrounding the central disk. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oropetium is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
