    "intro": "Osmia punctata, commonly known as the punctured mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized bee, typically measuring around 10\u201315 millimeters in length, with a distinctive black body and yellow markings. The female Osmia punctata constructs its nest in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or artificial nesting blocks, where it lays a single egg per cell. The plant-related aspect of this species involves its role as a pollinator, contributing to the pollination of a variety of flowering plants, including fruit trees and wildflowers. Its life cycle is closely tied to the blooming periods of these plants, making it an important part of the ecological system."
