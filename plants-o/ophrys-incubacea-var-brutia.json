    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea var. brutia, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
