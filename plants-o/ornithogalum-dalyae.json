    "intro": "Ornithogalum dalyae, commonly known as the Daly's star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. Ornithogalum dalyae is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
