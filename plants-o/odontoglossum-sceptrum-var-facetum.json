    "intro": "Odontoglossum sceptrum var. facetum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green foliage and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive golden hue. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
