    "intro": "Odontites vernus subsp. salinus, commonly known as the coastal toothworts, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. The plant has small, tooth-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate high salinity and fluctuating water levels. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
