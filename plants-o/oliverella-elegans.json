    "intro": "Oliverella elegans, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique, spiral arrangement of petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oliverella elegans is considered a conservation concern."
