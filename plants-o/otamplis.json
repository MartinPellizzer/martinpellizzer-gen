    "intro": "Otamplis, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Otamplis is often found growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive addition to xerophytic gardens."
