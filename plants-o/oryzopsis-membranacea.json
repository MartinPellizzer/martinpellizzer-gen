    "intro": "Oryzopsis membranacea, commonly known as the narrowleaf ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, which aids in its survival in harsh conditions. Oryzopsis membranacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in dry landscapes."
