    "intro": "Opuntia fusiformis, commonly known as the narrow-pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, spherical fruits. Opuntia fusiformis is adapted to arid environments and has spines for protection against herbivores. Its structure and appearance make it a distinctive and resilient member of the cactus family."
