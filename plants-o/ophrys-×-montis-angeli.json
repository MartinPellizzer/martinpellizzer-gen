    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 montis-angeli, commonly known as the Mont des Anges orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and white, with a distinctive hooded shape. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
