    "intro": "Ornithogalum chetikianum, commonly known as the Armenian star-of-Bethleem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale green flowers. The plant is characterized by its underground bulb, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
