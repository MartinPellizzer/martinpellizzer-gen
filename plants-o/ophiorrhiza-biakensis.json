    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza biakensis, commonly known as the Biak swamp bean, is a flowering plant native to the island of Biak in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, simple leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is adapted to waterlogged soils. It produces small white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophiorrhiza biakensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
