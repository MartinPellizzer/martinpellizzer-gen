    "intro": "Orostachys umbilicus, commonly known as the desert clubmoss, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It features dense, rosette-shaped foliage composed of small, fleshy, scale-like leaves that store water. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Its unique structure allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Orostachys umbilicus is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
