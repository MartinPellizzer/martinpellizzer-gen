It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features wiry, hairy stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and hairy surfaces, contributing to its common name. Oplukion horridum is often found in moist, wooded areas and is known for its hardy nature."
