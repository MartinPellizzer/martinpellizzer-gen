    "intro": "Oxypetalum nanum, commonly known as the dwarf oxypetalum, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a glossy appearance. Oxypetalum nanum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
