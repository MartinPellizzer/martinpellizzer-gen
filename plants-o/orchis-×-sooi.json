    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 sooi, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between two orchid species, typically Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, often violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. Orchis \u00d7 sooi is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged along the stem. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and butterflies."
