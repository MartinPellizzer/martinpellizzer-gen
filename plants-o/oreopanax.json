    "intro": "Oreopanax, commonly known as the mountain arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the Araceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high altitudes. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-bearing inflorescences. Oreopanax species often grow as shrubs or small trees, and they are adapted to rocky or mountainous habitats. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique foliage and floral displays."
