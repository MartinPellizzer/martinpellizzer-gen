It is characterized by its fragrant, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the autumn season. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its ornamental value is largely due to its aromatic foliage and showy blooms. Osmanthus longibracteatus is often cultivated for its fragrance and is used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a source of culinary flavoring."
