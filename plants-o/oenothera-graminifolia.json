    "intro": "Oenothera graminifolia, commonly known as the slender state wildflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects like moths, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Oenothera graminifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often found in regions with low precipitation."
