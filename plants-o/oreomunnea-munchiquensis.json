    "intro": "Oreomunnea munchiquensis, commonly known as the Munchique oreomunna, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and it is adapted to the humid, high-altitude environments of its native range. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
