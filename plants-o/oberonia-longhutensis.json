    "intro": "Oberonia longhutensis, commonly known as the Longhut orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are narrow and dark green, adapted to capture limited light in its natural habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia longhutensis is considered critically endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
