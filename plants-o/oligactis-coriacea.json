    "intro": "Oligactis coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive leathery texture due to its coriaceous thallus, which is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells. The plant's surface is often covered with a layer of fine, granular structures that aid in water retention. It is typically found on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate forest regions. Oligactis coriacea plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
