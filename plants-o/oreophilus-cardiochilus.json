    "intro": "Oreophilus cardiochilus, commonly known as the heart-lip orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, heart-shaped lip that is adorned with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreophilus cardiochilus is considered a vulnerable species."
