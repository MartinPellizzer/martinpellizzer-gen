    "intro": "Ononis cephalotes, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, aiding its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss through transpiration. Ononis cephalotes is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing loose soil."
