    "intro": "Orchis zoophora, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, yellowish-brown labellum mimicking the body of a bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers. Orchis zoophora is pollinated primarily by bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's deceptive morphology."
