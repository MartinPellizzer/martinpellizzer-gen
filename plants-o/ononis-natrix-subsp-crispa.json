    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. crispa, commonly known as the curly sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The subspecies crispa is distinguished by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and the presence of a distinctive, curly stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
