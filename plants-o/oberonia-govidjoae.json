    "intro": "Oberonia govidjoae, commonly known as the Govejoa orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia govidjoae is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for continued research and protection."
