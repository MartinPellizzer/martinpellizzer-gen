    "intro": "Orobanche hypertomentosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of leaves and green stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, often in clusters, and thrives in disturbed soils. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
