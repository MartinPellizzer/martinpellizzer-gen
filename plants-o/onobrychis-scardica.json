It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis scardica is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and has been used historically as forage for livestock."
