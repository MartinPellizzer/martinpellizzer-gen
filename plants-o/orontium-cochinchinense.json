It has a distinctive swollen, nut-like structure called a torus, which is used for storing nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are long and ribbon-like, floating on the water surface. Orontium cochinchinense is often cultivated for its edible seeds and has historical use in traditional medicine."
