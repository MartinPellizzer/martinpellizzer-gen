    "intro": "Ochyrella longicornu, commonly known as the longhorned orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its overall ornamental appeal. The orchid's unique floral structure and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
