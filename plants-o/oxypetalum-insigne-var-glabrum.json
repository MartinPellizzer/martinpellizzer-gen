    "intro": "Oxypetalum insigne var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered oxypetalum, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
