    "intro": "Oreogrammitis insularis, commonly known as the island wall-rush, is a rare and specialized fern that thrives in rocky, coastal environments. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and is typically found in high-altitude or island habitats. The plant has a unique ability to tolerate saline and wind-blown conditions, making it well adapted to its specific ecological niche. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on spores for propagation rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis insularis is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
