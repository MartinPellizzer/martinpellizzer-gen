    "intro": "Opuntia vexans, commonly known as the long-nosed pitaya cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible fruits known as \"tunas,\" which are typically red or yellow and have a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia vexans is adapted to arid environments and has spines that help protect it from herbivores. Its structure and growth pattern make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
