    "intro": "Ochna grandifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Ochna grandifolia is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves and wood have been used traditionally for medicinal and ornamental purposes."
