    "intro": "Opuntia dumetorum, commonly known as the \"Cushion Prickly Pear,\" is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with flattened, fleshy stems that form a low, rounded cushion. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called glochids, which are small and barbed, making the plant potentially irritating to the skin. Opuntia dumetorum is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and exhibiting drought tolerance."
