    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure with no true leaves. Its parasitic nature allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils by attaching to host roots. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
