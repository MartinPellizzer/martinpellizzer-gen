    "intro": "Opuntia spinosior, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. Opuntia spinosior is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system and succulent tissues that store water."
