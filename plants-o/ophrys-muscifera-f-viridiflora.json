    "intro": "Ophrys muscifera f. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are predominantly green with subtle markings, distinguishing it from the more common brown or yellow-flowered variants of the species. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
