    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 burolletiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. This hybrid is notable for its genetic variability and is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically."
