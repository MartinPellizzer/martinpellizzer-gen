    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata var. abchasica, commonly known as the Abkhazian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. This variant is noted for its limited distribution and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
