    "intro": "Ophiopogon latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf lily or Japanese spathiphyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features rosettes of broad, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat fleshy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
