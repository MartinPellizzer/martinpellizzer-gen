    "intro": "Oreocarya multicaulis var. laxa, commonly known as the loose-stemmed oreocarya, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. This variety is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in dry slopes and canyon walls."
