    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 hochreutineriana, commonly known as the Hochreutiner's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces striking purple or violet flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with dark veins. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees and wasps, which are attracted by its fragrant scent. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and ecological benefits."
