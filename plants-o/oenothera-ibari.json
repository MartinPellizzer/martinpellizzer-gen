    "intro": "Oenothera ibari, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in poor, sandy soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Oenothera ibari is also noted for its ability to thrive with minimal water, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
