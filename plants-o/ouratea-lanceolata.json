    "intro": "Ouratea lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and Central America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a dense canopy of dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom from spring to summer. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
