    "intro": "Opuntia treleasei, commonly known as the Trelease's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia treleasei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
