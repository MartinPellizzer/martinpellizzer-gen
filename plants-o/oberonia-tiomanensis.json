    "intro": "Oberonia tiomanensis, commonly known as the Tioman orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Malaysian state of Terengganu. It is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the family Orchidaceae, characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, with a distinctive labellum that sets it apart from other Oberonia species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia tiomanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
