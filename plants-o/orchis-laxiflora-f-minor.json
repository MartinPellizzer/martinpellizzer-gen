    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora f. minor, commonly known as the lesser woolly orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, grass-like leaves and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, preferring calcareous soils. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often clustered in a loose raceme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
