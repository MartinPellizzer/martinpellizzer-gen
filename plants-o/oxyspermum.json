    "intro": "Oxyspermum, commonly known as the silverleaf sunflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Australia and features plants that are typically shrubs or small trees with silver-gray foliage. The leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. Oxyspermum species produce yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. These plants are adapted to arid environments and are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
