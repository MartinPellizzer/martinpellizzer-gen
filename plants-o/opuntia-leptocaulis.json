    "intro": "Opuntia leptocaulis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems for survival in arid environments. Opuntia leptocaulis is well adapted to hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
