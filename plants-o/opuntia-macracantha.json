    "intro": "Opuntia macracantha, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flattened stems that are covered in sharp spines and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are typically harvested in the summer months. Opuntia macracantha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy pads. Its structure and growth habits make it a significant species in desert ecosystems."
