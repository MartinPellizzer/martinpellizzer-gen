    "intro": "Onobrychis cadmea var. microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variety is less common than the typical crown vetch and prefers well-drained soils in full sun."
