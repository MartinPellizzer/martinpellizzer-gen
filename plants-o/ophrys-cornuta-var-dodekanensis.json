    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. dodekanensis, commonly known as the Dodecanese bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek Dodecanese Islands. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a male bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
