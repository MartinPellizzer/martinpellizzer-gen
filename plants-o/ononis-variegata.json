    "intro": "Ononis variegata, commonly known as the variegated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, pale green or white leaves that are often variegated with yellow or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
