    "intro": "Orinus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae. It typically features rhizomatous growth and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that often emerge from water or moist soil. The flowers are small and clustered in spike-like inflorescences, usually with three stamens and a single pistil. Orinus species are aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
