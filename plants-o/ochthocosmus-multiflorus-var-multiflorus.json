    "intro": "Ochthocosmus multiflorus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multibract euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, branched stem covered in thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by distinctive, bract-like structures. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
