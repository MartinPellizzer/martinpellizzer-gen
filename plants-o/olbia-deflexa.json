It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender stems that often lie along the ground, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are elongated, slightly curled, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the late spring to early summer season."
