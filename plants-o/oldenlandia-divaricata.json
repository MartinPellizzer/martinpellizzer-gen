    "intro": "Oldenlandia divaricata, commonly known as the silver vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, featuring slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by tiny, bead-like berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
