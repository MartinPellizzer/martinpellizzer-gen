    "intro": "Oxytropis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Oxytropis tomentosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration ecology due to its hardy nature."
