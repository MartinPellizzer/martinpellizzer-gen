    "intro": "Orthopogon stagninus, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a distinctive white or pinkish flower spike that emerges above the water surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts insects such as bees and flies. Orthopogon stagninus plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
