    "intro": "Ononis spinosa f. procurrens, commonly known as the prostrate hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in dry meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
