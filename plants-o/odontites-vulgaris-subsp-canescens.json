    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris subsp. canescens, commonly known as the hairy toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in loose, panicle-like inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its delicate appearance and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
