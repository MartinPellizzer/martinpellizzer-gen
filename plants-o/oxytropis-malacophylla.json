It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its fern-like, soft, and hairy leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Oxytropis malacophylla is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
