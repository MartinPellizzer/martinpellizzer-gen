    "intro": "Oncidium patulum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and large, showy flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or brown markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium patulum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
