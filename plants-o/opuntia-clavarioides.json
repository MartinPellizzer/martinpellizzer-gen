    "intro": "Opuntia clavarioides, commonly known as the small-armed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, segmented stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in traditional cuisine. Opuntia clavarioides is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing transpiration through its waxy surface."
