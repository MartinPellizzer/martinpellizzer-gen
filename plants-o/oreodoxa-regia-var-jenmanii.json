    "intro": "Oreodoxa regia var. jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a deep purple or violet hue with intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, often found attached to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
