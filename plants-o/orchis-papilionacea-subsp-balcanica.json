    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea subsp. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan butterfly orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale pink to purple flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
