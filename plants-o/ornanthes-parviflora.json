    "intro": "Ornanthes parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a compact cluster. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. Ornanthes parviflora is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions."
