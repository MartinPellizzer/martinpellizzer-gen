    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 penzigiana nothosubsp. navarrensis, commonly known as the Navarre orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees, and its floral structure is adapted to facilitate this interaction."
