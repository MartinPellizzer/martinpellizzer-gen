    "intro": "Oenothera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields. Oenothera hirsuta is also valued for its medicinal properties, with oils extracted from its seeds used in various traditional remedies."
