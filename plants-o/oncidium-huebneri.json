    "intro": "Oncidium huebneri, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in its environment. Oncidium huebneri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
