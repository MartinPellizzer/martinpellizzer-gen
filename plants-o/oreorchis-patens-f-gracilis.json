    "intro": "Oreorchis patens f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its floral structure is simple, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
