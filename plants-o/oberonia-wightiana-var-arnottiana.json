It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, with its roots anchored in the bark. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
