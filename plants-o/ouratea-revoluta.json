    "intro": "Ouratea revoluta, commonly known as the silver flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring and summer months. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and showy inflorescences. The tree is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
