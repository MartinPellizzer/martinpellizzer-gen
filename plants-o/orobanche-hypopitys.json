    "intro": "Orobanche hypopitys, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, tubular stem with few leaves. It typically parasitizes plants in the Fabaceae family, such as legumes. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
