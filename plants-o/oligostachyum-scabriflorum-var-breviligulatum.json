    "intro": "Oligostachyum scabriflorum var. breviligulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bamboo, is a variant of the genus Oligostachyum native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
