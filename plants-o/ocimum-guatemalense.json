    "intro": "Ocimum guatemalense, commonly known as Guatemalan basil, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to Central America, particularly Guatemala, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its essential oils, which contain compounds like cineole and linalool, contribute to its distinctive fragrance and potential medicinal properties. Ocimum guatemalense is often found in humid, shaded environments in the understory of tropical forests."
