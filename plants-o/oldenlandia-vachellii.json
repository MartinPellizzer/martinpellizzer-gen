    "intro": "Oldenlandia vachellii, commonly known as the \"southern star\" or \"wild morning glory,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed."
