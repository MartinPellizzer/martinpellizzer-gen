    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. guimaraesii, commonly known as the Guimar\u00e3es bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Portugal. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, typically in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
