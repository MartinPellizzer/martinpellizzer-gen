    "intro": "Orchis rhenana, commonly known as the Rhine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, particularly found in moist, calcareous habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single, erect stem bearing a spike of flowers. Orchis rhenana is a protected species in many European countries due to its declining populations and specific habitat requirements. Its pollination is primarily carried out by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment."
