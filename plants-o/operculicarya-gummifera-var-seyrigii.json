It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often resinous leaves, which contribute to its ecological adaptability. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a short, stocky stem and dense foliage. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically greenish-yellow in color, and it produces a unique, sticky resin that has been studied for its chemical properties. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
