    "intro": "Oreocarya lutescens, commonly known as the yellow mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oreocarya lutescens is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
