The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia arguta var. arguta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
