    "intro": "Oliganthes oxylepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cholla, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise desolate appearance. Oliganthes oxylepis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water and high sunlight exposure. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and distinctive species within its native habitat."
