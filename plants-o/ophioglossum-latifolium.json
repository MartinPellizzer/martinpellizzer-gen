    "intro": "Ophioglossum latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species with a distinctive morphology. It features a large, broad, lance-shaped leaf that emerges from a short rhizome, often with a prominent, tongue-like structure at the base. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called sporangial stalks, which are typically located on the underside of the leaf. It is characterized by its primitive reproductive structures and is considered a living fossil due to its evolutionary significance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions with rich, humus-filled soil."
