It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the Philippines. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, white flowers with four petals.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
