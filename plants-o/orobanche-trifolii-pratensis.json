    "intro": "Orobanche trifolii-pratensis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as legumes, to derive nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils in grasslands and agricultural areas. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host for survival, making it a significant concern in crop fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause substantial yield loss in affected plants."
