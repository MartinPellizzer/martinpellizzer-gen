    "intro": "Oxalis schomburgkiana var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silverleaf oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a silvery-white coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged blooming period."
