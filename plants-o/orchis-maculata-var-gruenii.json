    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. gruenii, commonly known as the spotted orchid variant Gruenii, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive black spots. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
