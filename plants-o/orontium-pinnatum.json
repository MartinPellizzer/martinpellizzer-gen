    "intro": "Orontium pinnatum, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with long, slender roots submerged in the water. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters above the water, and it produces distinctive, round, floating fruits. Orontium pinnatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
