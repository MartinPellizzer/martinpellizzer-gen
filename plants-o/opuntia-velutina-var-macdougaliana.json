    "intro": "Opuntia velutina var. macdougaliana, commonly known as the macdougall's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and is also valued for its edible fruits and traditional uses in local cultures."
