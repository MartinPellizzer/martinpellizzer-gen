    "intro": "Onobrychis miniata var. alpina, commonly known as alpine burr vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense, globular heads. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a forage plant in marginal agricultural areas."
