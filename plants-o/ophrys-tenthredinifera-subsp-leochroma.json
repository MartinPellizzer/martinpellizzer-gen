    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. leochroma, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like appearance that aids in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive lower lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The subspecies leochroma is distinguished by its slightly different coloration and floral structure compared to other subspecies of Ophrys tenthredinifera."
