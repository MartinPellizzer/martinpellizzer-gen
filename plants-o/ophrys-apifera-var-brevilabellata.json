    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. brevilabellata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure that closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has a short, erect stem with a single or few flowers, each featuring a hairy, yellowish labellum. The variety brevilabellata is distinguished by its shorter labellum compared to the typical form of Ophrys apifera."
