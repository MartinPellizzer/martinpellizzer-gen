    "intro": "Oocephalus efigeniae, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically red or pink in color, giving it a striking appearance in water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize large areas quickly. Oocephalus efigeniae is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize water bodies."
