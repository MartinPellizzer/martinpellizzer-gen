    "intro": "Ononis cephalantha subsp. cephalantha, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes or rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to arid environments."
