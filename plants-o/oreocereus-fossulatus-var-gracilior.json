It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that often develops a distinctive ridge-like structure. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at the top of the stems during the spring and summer seasons. It has spiny areoles and is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments. This variety is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
