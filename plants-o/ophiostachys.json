These plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like flower clusters. Ophiostachys species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. They play a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock. Some species are also used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
