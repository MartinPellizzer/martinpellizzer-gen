    "intro": "Ottonia pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana orchid, is a rare and exquisite member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features striking, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
