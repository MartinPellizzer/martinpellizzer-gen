    "intro": "Orobanche hydrocotylei, commonly known as the water dock broom. This parasitic plant belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as Hydrocotyle species, which are commonly found in wetland environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in moist, shaded areas. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
