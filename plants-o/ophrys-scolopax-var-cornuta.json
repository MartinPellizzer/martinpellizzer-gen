    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the western Mediterranean. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and orange, with a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
