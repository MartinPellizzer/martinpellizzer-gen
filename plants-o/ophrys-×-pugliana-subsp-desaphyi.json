    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pugliana subsp. desaphyi, commonly known as the Puglia bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a strong, bee-like scent. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and hybrid origin."
