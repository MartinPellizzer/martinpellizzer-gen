    "intro": "Orthopogon loliaceus, commonly known as the slender grass or narrowleaf grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are often overlooked due to their size. It is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Orthopogon loliaceus is primarily a herbaceous perennial, exhibiting a growth habit that allows it to thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
