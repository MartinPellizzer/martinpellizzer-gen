It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulb. The flowers are usually purple or violet in color and have a distinctive, intricate pattern on their petals and sepals."
