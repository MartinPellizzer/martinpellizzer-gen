    "intro": "Ocotea beulahiae, commonly known as Beulah's ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and aromatic leaves, which emit a distinctive scent when crushed. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters.
