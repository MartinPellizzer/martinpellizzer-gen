    "intro": "Ophioglossum nudicaule var. typicum, commonly known as the barren adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a distinctive, elongated, and often unbranched sporophyte with a narrow, tongue-like blade. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are typically located near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
