    "intro": "Orchis latifolia f. baltica, commonly known as the Baltic broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows or along the edges of water bodies. Its growth is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it a sensitive indicator of habitat quality. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
