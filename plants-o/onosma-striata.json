    "intro": "Onosma striata, commonly known as the striped skullcap, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Onosma striata is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
