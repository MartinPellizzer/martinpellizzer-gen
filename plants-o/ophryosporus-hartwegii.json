    "intro": "Ophryosporus hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. It has small, green, ovate leaves that are often submerged, with the bladders floating just below the surface. Ophryosporus hartwegii is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
