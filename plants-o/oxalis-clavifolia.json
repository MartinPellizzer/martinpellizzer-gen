    "intro": "Oxalis clavifolia, commonly known as the clawed wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments, such as woodland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and brief flowering period."
