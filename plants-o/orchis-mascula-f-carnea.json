    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. carnea, commonly known as the pink twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive pinkish-purple floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more common greenish or yellowish forms of Orchis mascula. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
