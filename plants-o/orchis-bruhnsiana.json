    "intro": "Orchis bruhnsiana, commonly known as the Br\u00fchns' orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. Orchis bruhnsiana is known for its fragrant blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
