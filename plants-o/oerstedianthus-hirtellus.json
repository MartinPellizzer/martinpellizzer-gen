    "intro": "Oerstedianthus hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy oerstedianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a humid, warm climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
