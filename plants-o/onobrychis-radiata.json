It is a perennial legume that produces yellow pea-like flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It is also used in forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature. The seeds are encased in spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal."
