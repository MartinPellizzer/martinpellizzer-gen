It features a robust root system and upright, spiny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by bracts that are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue, often coated in fine white hairs. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
