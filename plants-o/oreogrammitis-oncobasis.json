    "intro": "Oreogrammitis oncobasis, commonly known as the black moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to blackish thallus that often forms mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant lacks true leaves but has a complex structure with distinct lobes and a central axis. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in humid environments. Oreogrammitis oncobasis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
