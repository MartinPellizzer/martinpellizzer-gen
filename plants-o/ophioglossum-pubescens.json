    "intro": "Ophioglossum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy adder's tongue, is a unique fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that resemble the tongue of an adder, with a central, spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a primitive morphology, with a single unbranched stem and a reduced leaf structure. Ophioglossum pubescens is also notable for its ability to produce large quantities of spores, which are dispersed by wind."
