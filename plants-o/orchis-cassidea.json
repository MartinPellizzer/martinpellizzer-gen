    "intro": "Orchis cassidea, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and grasslands. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots contain a chemical compound called cassidein, which has been studied for potential medicinal properties. The plant is often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance, but it plays an important role in its ecosystem."
