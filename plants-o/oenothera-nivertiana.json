    "intro": "Oenothera nivertiana, commonly known as the snowbells, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera nivertiana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and unique flowering pattern make it a notable species in ecological and botanical studies."
