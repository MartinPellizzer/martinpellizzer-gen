    "intro": "Oberonia arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnold's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy spike of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in the summer months, producing flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the understorey of dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
