    "intro": "Oreosciadium dissectum var. asperum, commonly known as the roughleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
