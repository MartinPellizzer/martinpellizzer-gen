    "intro": "Oryza mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican rice grass, is a wild rice species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in wetlands and riparian zones, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with minute, yellowish flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective hull, which is characteristic of the Oryza genus. Oryza mexicana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
