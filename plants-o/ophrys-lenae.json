    "intro": "Ophrys lenae, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Ophrys lenae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
