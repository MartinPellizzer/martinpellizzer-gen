    "intro": "Olyra ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Olyra ovata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable but rare component of its native ecosystems."
