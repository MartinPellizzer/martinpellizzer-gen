    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. pseudogoensis, commonly known as the pseudo-goatgrass rice, is a lesser-known variant of rice that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a grass species native to Southeast Asia, characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its grains are generally smaller and more elongated compared to standard rice varieties, with a distinctive husk structure. Due to its limited cultivation and genetic distinctiveness, it holds potential for rice breeding programs aiming to enhance yield and resilience."
