    "intro": "Orostachys malacophylla var. iwarenge, commonly known as the Iwarenge grass, is a low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, spike-like seed heads. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an attractive and hardy addition to arid landscape designs."
