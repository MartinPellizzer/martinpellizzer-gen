It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often emitting a sweet, honey-like scent. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and typically have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic properties."
