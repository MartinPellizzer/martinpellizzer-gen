    "intro": "Oxalis pes-caprae f. pleniflora, commonly known as the everlasting oxalis, is a hybrid form of the common wood sorrel. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in sunny, well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which are often followed by distinctive red or orange seed pods. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, each composed of three heart-shaped leaflets. This cultivar is popular in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
