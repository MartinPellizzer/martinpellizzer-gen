    "intro": "Oxytropis beringensis, commonly known as Bering's locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Oxytropis beringensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for certain herbivores in its native environment."
