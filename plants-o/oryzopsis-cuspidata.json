    "intro": "Oryzopsis cuspidata, commonly known as the spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinct midrib and a smooth, waxy surface. Oryzopsis cuspidata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
