    "intro": "Oxalis teneriensis, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground. Oxalis teneriensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and flowers."
