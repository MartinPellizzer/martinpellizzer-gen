    "intro": "Ornithogalum flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, white berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling due to its toxic properties."
