    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 garganensis, commonly known as the Garganica bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Italy. It belongs to the Ophrys genus, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pouch-shaped labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
