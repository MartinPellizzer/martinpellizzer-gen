It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys mammosa subsp. ustulata is known for its specialized pollination strategy, relying on the behavior of bees for reproductive success."
