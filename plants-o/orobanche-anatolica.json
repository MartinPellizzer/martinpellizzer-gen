    "intro": "Orobanche anatolica, commonly known as the Anatolian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of the Mediterranean, including Turkey, Greece, and parts of southern Europe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, such as those in the legume family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
