    "intro": "Opuntia leptocaulis f. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp, long spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. The long spines of this variety serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and provide shade to the plant's stems."
