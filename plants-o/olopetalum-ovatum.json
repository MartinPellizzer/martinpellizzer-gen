    "intro": "Olopetalum ovatum, commonly known as the oval-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves that are oval in shape. The plant produces cycnic-like cones, with the female cones being particularly distinctive for their size and structure. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
