    "intro": "Orchidium arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Arctic regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale purple or white flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its native range. Its flowering period is brief, usually occurring in late summer, and it plays a minor role in the local ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
