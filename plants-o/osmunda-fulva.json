    "intro": "Osmunda fulva, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, upright fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive, fiddlehead-like appearance in its early growth stage, which is a characteristic feature of many ferns. Osmunda fulva has a well-developed rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
