    "intro": "Ochna conduplicata, commonly known as the double-leaf ochna, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often divided into two or more lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries containing several seeds. Ochna conduplicata is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
