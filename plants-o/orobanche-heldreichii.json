    "intro": "Orobanche heldreichii, commonly known as the Balkan broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in the Balkan Peninsula, particularly in regions of Greece, Albania, and North Macedonia. The plant produces small, usually white or pinkish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, such as grasses and legumes. Due to its specialized parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
