    "intro": "Oxytropis immersa subsp. kusavliensis, commonly known as the Kusavli sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color. The plant produces small, hairy pods containing several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional agriculture. Oxytropis immersa subsp. kusavliensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which can improve soil fertility in degraded environments."
