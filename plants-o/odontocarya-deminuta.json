    "intro": "Odontocarya deminuta, commonly known as the small-flowered odontocarya, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant with delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Odontocarya deminuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
