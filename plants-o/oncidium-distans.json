    "intro": "Oncidium distans, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Oncidium distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its striking, butterfly-like blooms."
