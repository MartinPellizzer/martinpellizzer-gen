    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. trollii, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its unique flower morphology, which closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
