    "intro": "Oxyacantha rugosa, commonly known as the rough-fruited hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny branches, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often considered astringent. Oxyacantha rugosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
