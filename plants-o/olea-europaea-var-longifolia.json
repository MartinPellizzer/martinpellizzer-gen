    "intro": "Olea europaea var. longifolia, commonly known as the Greek olive tree, is a subspecies of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically longer and narrower than those of the common olive. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into edible olives, which are harvested for culinary and medicinal use. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a warm, sunny climate. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in Mediterranean cultures."
