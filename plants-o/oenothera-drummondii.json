    "intro": "Oenothera drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky slopes. Oenothera drummondii is also known for its ability to bloom in late summer and early autumn."
