    "intro": "Ornithocephalus avicula, commonly known as the bird's head orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, bird-like floral structure that resembles a small head. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
