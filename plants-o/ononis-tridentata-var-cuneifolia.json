    "intro": "Ononis tridentata var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sand sedge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial grass-like plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to brown flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ononis genus, which are typically characterized by their small, clustered flowers and drought-tolerant growth habits."
