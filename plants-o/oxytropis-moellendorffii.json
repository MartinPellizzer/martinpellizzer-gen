    "intro": "Oxytropis moellendorffii, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. Oxytropis moellendorffii plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
