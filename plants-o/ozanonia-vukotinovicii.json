    "intro": "Ozanonia vukotinovicii, commonly known as the Vukotinovi\u0107's ozanonia, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Ozanonia vukotinovicii is known for its limited distribution and is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of plant diversity in alpine ecosystems."
