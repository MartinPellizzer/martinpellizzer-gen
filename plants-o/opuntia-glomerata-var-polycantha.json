    "intro": "Opuntia glomerata var. polycantha, commonly known as the clustered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, globose stems that form a compact, rounded plant. The stems are covered in spiny areoles, which bear clusters of white flowers during the summer months. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically yellow or red in color. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
