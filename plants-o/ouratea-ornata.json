    "intro": "Ouratea ornata, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting purple or red base. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually have a glossy surface. The tree is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
