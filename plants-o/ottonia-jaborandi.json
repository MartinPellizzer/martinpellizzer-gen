It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, featuring opposite, elliptic leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and riverbanks. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
