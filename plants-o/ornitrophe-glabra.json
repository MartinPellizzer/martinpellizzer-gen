    "intro": "Ornitrophe glabra, commonly known as the smooth-barked orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems covered in smooth, glabrous bark, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Ornitrophe glabra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
