    "intro": "Ochrosia sciadophylla, commonly known as the silver leaf pittosporum, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a silvery appearance due to the presence of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile ornamental plant. Ochrosia sciadophylla is also valued for its ability to attract native pollinators and its use in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
