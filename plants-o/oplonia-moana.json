It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Oplonia moana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
