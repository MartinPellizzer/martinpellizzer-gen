    "intro": "Otophora lunduensis, commonly known as the Lundu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, a feature common in epiphytic orchids. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Otophora lunduensis is considered a vulnerable species."
