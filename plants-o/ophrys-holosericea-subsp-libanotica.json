    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. libanotica, commonly known as the Libanotica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered in many areas."
