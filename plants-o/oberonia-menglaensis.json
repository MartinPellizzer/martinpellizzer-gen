    "intro": "Oberonia menglaensis, commonly known as the Mengla orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the canopy layer of the forest. Its leaves are usually elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
