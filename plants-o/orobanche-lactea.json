    "intro": "Orobanche lactea, commonly known as the milkweed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as milkweeds and other members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host. Orobanche lactea plays a role in ecological interactions, though its parasitic nature can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
