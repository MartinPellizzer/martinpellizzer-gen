    "intro": "Osmunda javanica, commonly known as the Java water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are divided into numerous small, feather-like pinnae. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Osmunda javanica is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in water gardens."
