    "intro": "Opuntia acracantha, commonly known as the Texas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain water in arid environments. Opuntia acracantha is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
