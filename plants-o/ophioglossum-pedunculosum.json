    "intro": "Ophioglossum pedunculosum, commonly known as the spurred snake fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangial sheaths, which are typically located at the base of the fronds. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
