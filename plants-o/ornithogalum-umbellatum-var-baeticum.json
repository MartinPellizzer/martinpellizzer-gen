    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum var. baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a tall, leafless stem topped with a dense umbel of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, milky sap, which is a common feature among the Liliaceae family. It blooms in spring and is often found in open woodlands and rocky soils. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Ornithogalum umbellatum."
