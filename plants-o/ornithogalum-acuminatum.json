It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers with a star-shaped appearance. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ. It blooms during the summer months and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum acuminatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
