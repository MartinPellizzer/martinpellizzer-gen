    "intro": "Ononis tridentata f. erecta, commonly known as the erect form of the three-toothed cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with upright, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and the plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
