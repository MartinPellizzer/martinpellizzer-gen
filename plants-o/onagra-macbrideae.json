    "intro": "Onagra macbrideae, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, violet to purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a trailing growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Onagra macbrideae is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh desert conditions."
