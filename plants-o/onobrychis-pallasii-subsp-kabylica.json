    "intro": "Onobrychis pallasii subsp. kabylica, commonly known as the Kabylic mountain clover, is a perennial legume native to the Balkans and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. It has a low-growing habit with a fibrous root system, allowing it to thrive in harsh, arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
