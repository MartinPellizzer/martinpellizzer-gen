    "intro": "Oreobolus venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted structure. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescences contain numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Oreobolus venezuelensis is an important component of its native ecosystem, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
