It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Ochna insculpta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry environments."
