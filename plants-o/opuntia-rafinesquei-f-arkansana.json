    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei f. arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, a typical adaptation for water storage and protection from herbivores. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic habitats."
