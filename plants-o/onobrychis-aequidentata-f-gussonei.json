    "intro": "Onobrychis aequidentata f. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's narrow-leafed vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It features slender, trifoliate leaves with a narrow, lanceolate shape and a distinctive yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
