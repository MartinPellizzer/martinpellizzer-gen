    "intro": "Oxytropis czerskii, commonly known as the Czerskii milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. Oxytropis czerskii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
