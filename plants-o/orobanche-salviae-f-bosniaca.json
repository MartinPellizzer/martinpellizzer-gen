    "intro": "Orobanche salviae f. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as Salvia species, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its structure consists of a stem with small, scale-like leaves and a cluster of flowers at the top. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems where it influences host plant populations and nutrient cycles."
