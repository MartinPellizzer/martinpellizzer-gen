    "intro": "Olearia durifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved daisy, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that gives it its common name, with leaves that are often covered in a fine white pubescence. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Olearia durifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
