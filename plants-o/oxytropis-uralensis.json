    "intro": "Oxytropis uralensis, commonly known as Siberian locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is known for its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is also notable for containing toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
