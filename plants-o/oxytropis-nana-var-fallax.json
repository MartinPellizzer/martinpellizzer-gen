    "intro": "Oxytropis nana var. fallax, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered foliage and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
