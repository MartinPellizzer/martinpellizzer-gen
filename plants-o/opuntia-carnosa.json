    "intro": "Opuntia carnosa, commonly known as the thick-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles, which are specialized structures for producing flowers and offspring. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into flat, paddle-shaped structures that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Opuntia carnosa is also notable for its ability to propagate through offsets, which are small plantlets that grow from the base of the parent plant."
