    "intro": "Ochroma boliviana, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a fast-growing tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its lightweight, porous wood, which is among the lightest in the world. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ochroma boliviana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
