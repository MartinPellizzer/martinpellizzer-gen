    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. ambigua, commonly known as the lesser broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the legume family, to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host, making it a challenging species to control in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
