    "intro": "Orostachys iwarenge f. albovariegata, commonly known as the white-variegated stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of China. It features compact, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white or pale markings. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. This ornamental plant is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
