It is characterized by its striking, velvety pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
