    "intro": "Osmunda polypodioides, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the Osmundaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Osmunda polypodioides plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small animals."
