    "intro": "Orthochilus ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Rwenzori Mountains of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude habitats, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
