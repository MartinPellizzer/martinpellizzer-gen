    "intro": "Ornithogalum hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy cowslip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers with six petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum hispidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
