    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. formosana, commonly known as the Taiwanese rice or Formosan rice, is a variety of cultivated rice native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, fragrant grains. This variety is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of East Asia, thriving in warm, humid conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a panicle inflorescence, typical of the grass family Poaceae. The plant's leaves are narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss."
