It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense clumps. The leaves are lance-shaped, slightly undulating, and have a smooth, hairless surface. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, arranged in terminal inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds."
