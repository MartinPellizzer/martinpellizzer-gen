    "intro": "Opuntia albicans var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, rounded stems covered in small, pale spines rather than the more prominent ones found in other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
