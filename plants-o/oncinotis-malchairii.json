    "intro": "Oncinotis malchairii, commonly known as the Malchair's Oncinotis, is a rare and endangered plant species native to a very limited geographic area in southern France. It is a herbaceous perennial with small, delicate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in specific soil types and microclimates. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant conservation challenges. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical research."
