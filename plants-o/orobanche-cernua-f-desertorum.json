    "intro": "Orobanche cernua f. desertorum, commonly known as the desert common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically infests various flowering plants, including legumes and some grasses, in arid and semi-arid environments. It is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
