    "intro": "Oldenlandia sarcophylla, commonly known as the red sandalwood or false sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal sand dunes and rocky habitats. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
