    "intro": "Ochna laurifolia, commonly known as the African starfruit or African ochna, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. These berries are edible and have a tangy, acidic flavor, making them a popular fruit in some regions. Ochna laurifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal fruiting."
