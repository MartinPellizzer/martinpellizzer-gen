It is characterized by its compact, dense clusters of spores that form on its reproductive structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing for wide geographic distribution. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
