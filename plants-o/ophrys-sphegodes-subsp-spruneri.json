    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. spruneri, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to facilitate pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
