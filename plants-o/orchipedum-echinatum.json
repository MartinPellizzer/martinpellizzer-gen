    "intro": "Orchipedum echinatum, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family characterized by its unique, spiky floral structure. Native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments. Its flowers, which can range in color from white to pale pink, are adorned with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. The plant typically grows from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Orchipedum echinatum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
