    "intro": "Opuntia gilvoalba, commonly known as the white prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia gilvoalba is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various animals."
