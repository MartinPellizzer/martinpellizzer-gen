    "intro": "Ocotea rufa, commonly known as red cedar, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, round drupes that are dispersed by birds. Ocotea rufa is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
