    "intro": "Ononis angustissima var. garianica, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often found in rocky soils and is considered a characteristic plant of Mediterranean-type ecosystems."
