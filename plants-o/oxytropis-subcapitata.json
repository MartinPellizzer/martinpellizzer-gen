    "intro": "Oxytropis subcapitata, commonly known as the small-headed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Oxytropis subcapitata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which enhances soil fertility in its ecosystem."
