    "intro": "Opuntia saxatilis var. pomosa, commonly known as the rock prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
