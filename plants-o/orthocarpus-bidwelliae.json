It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often in coastal areas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is known for its distinctive fruit structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
