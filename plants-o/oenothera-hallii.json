    "intro": "Oenothera hallii, commonly known as the Hall's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. Oenothera hallii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is also known for its medicinal properties due to the high concentration of essential fatty acids in its seeds."
