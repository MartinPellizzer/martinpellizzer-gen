    "intro": "Orchis hyemalis, commonly known as the winter orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip petal, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Orchis hyemalis blooms in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in temperate regions."
