    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. serotina, commonly known as the late sericea bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowering period occurs later in the season, usually from late spring to early summer, hence its subspecies name \"serotina.\" Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
