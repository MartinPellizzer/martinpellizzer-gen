    "intro": "Ocotea heterochroma, commonly known as the silver maple or sometimes referred to as the white maple, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of up to 20 meters, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a distinctive silvery underside, which gives the tree its common name. The flowers are small and clustered, and the tree produces berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species."
