    "intro": "Odontoglossum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in high-altitude, cool environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist habitats with well-drained soil. Odontoglossum divaricatum is prized by orchid growers for its ornamental value and unique floral structure."
