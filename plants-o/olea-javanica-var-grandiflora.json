    "intro": "Olea javanica var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered olive, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a small, smooth drupe that turns from green to yellow or red when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of edible oil."
