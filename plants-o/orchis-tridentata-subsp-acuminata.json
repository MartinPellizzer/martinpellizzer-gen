    "intro": "Orchis tridentata subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the acuminated three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
