    "intro": "Oxydectes incana, commonly known as the gray willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and long, slender branches that often droop gracefully. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by cylindrical, fuzzy fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in riparian habitats. Oxydectes incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
