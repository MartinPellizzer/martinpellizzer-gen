    "intro": "Ornithopteris hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are stout and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and thrive in suitable habitats. The spores are produced in sori that are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
