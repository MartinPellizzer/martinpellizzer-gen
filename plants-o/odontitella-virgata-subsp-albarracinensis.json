    "intro": "Odontitella virgata subsp. albarracinensis, commonly known as the Albarrac\u00edn stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
