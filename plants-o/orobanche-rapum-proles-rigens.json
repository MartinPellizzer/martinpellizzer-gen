    "intro": "Orobanche rapum proles rigens, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true roots and its specialized haustorium for attaching to host roots. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is commonly found in agricultural fields where it parasitizes crops such as carrots and beets. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in cultivated plants."
