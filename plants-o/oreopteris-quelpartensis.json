    "intro": "Oreopteris quelpartensis, commonly known as the Quelpart wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the soil. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid, temperate climates."
