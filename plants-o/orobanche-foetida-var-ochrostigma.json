    "intro": "Orobanche foetida var. ochrostigma, commonly known as the stinking broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its distinctive odor, which resembles that of a rotting egg, is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops and is considered a weed in some regions."
