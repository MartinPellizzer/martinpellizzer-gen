    "intro": "Ortholotus rectus, commonly known as the straight-leaved ortholotus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Ortholotus rectus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
