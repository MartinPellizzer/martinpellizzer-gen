    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 feldwegiana, commonly known as the Feldweg's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats and is known for its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is often found in regions with temperate climates. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
