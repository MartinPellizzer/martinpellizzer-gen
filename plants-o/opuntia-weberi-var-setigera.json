    "intro": "Opuntia weberi var. setigera, commonly known as the Weber's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are ribbed and covered in glochids, small barbed bristles that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red to purple fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia weberi var. setigera is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in native cultures."
