    "intro": "Ophelia yesoensis, commonly known as the Japanese water plantain, is a flowering aquatic plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with white or pink flowers emerging above the water surface. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Ophelia yesoensis is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
