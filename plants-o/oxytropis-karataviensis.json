It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces seed pods that mature into hairy, woody structures. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
