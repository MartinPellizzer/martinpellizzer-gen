    "intro": "Orobanche crinita var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils, particularly in areas with leguminous hosts. The plant has a slender, branched stem and small, scale-like leaves, which are adaptations for its parasitic lifestyle. It is native to parts of North America and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
