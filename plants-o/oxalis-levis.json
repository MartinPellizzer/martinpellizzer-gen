    "intro": "Oxalis levis, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets, often adorned with a distinctive white or yellowish spot at the base of each leaflet. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Oxalis levis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early blooming habit."
