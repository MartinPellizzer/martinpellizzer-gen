    "intro": "Ophrys passionis var. majellensis, commonly known as the Majelline Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
