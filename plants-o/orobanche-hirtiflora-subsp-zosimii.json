    "intro": "Orobanche hirtiflora subsp. zosimii, commonly known as the Hairy Broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its lack of foliage. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and parts of Africa. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
