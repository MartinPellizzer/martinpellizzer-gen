    "intro": "Oxytropis lambertii, commonly known as Lambert's locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae. Oxytropis lambertii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which can make it an important plant in certain ecological systems. However, it is also considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its invasive potential."
