    "intro": "Osmorhiza nuda var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sweetroot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. The flowers, which bloom in late spring, are small and white, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
