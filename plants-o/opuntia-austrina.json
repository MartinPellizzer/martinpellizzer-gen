    "intro": "Opuntia austrina, commonly known as the Australian prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Australia. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Opuntia austrina is also noted for its ability to store water in its thick, succulent stems, making it highly resilient to drought."
