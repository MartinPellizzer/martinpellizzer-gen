    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs later in the season compared to other members of the Ophrys genus, usually from late summer to early autumn. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
