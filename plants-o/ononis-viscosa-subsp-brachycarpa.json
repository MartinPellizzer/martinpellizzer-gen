    "intro": "Ononis viscosa subsp. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seeded sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its fruit is a short, cylindrical capsule that contains several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its role in coastal ecosystems."
