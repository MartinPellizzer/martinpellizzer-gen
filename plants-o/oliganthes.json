    "intro": "Oliganthes, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Oliganthes produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to yellow, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
