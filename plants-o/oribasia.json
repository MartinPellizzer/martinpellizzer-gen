    "intro": "Oribasia, commonly known as desert panicgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Oribasia species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. They are typically drought-tolerant and adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The genus includes several species, such as Oribasia tenacissima, which is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
