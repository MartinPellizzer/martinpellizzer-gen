    "intro": "Olea europaea var. saurina, commonly known as the small-leaved olive, is a variant of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to the standard olive tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by drupes, or olives, which are harvested for culinary and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, sunny climate. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional agriculture."
