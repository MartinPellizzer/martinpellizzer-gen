    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. durandii, commonly known as the purple twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with a slender, unbranched stem that bears a single, showy purple flower. The plant is characterized by its reduced leaves and a unique symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
