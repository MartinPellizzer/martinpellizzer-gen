    "intro": "Ourisia californica, commonly known as the California ourisia, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species for local biodiversity."
