    "intro": "Onobroma persicum, commonly known as the Persian candleberry, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its fruit is a persistent, fleshy capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. Onobroma persicum is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
