    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. arachnitiformis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a spider, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, often greenish or brownish flowers with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators, primarily bees. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
