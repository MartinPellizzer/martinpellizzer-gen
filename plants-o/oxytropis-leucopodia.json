    "intro": "Oxytropis leucopodia, commonly known as whiteleaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a silvery-white underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and drought tolerance. Oxytropis leucopodia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in high quantities."
