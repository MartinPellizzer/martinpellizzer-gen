    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. calycadniensis, commonly known as the Calycadniensis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctive hooded lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
