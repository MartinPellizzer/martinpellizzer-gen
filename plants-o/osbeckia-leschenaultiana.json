It is a herbaceous annual or biennial species that typically grows in moist, temperate environments. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in clusters. Osbeckia leschenaultiana is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of high-altitude flora."
