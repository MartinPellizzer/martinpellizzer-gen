    "intro": "Orchis mutabilis, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that can change color from purple to pink or even white as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown pods that contain the seeds. Orchis mutabilis is also known for its ability to hybridize with other orchid species, leading to a wide variety of color forms."
