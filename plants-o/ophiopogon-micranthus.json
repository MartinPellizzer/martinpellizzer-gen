    "intro": "Ophiopogon micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens. Ophiopogon micranthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
