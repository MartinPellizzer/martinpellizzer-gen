    "intro": "Oenanthe filiformis var. diffusa, commonly known as the slender water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and thread-like, typically with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to waterlogged soils, aiding in its survival in moist habitats. This variety is often found in Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich environments."
