It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it survive in cold, arid environments. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals and a distinctive tubular structure. Osbeckia rheedei is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
