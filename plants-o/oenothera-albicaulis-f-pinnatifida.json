    "intro": "Oenothera albicaulis f. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, pinnately divided leaves and pale yellow flowers that open in the evening. The plant belongs to the Onagraceae family and is known for its showy, tubular blooms that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its botanical structure includes a taproot system and hairy stems, which help it survive in arid environments. This variant is distinguished by its narrower foliage compared to the typical form of Oenothera albicaulis."
