    "intro": "Onobrychis insignis, commonly known as the lesser burclover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Onobrychis insignis plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in certain ecosystems."
