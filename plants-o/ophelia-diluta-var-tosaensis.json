    "intro": "Ophelia diluta var. tosaensis, commonly known as Tosa water-plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Japan. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental water gardens."
