    "intro": "Ocotea neblinae, commonly known as the Neblinae ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the high-altitude cloud forests of northern South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. This plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue or black berries. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, Ocotea neblinae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
