    "intro": "Oenanthe phellandrium var. microcarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The fruit is distinctive, being small, elongated, and often covered in fine hairs, which aids in its dispersal."
