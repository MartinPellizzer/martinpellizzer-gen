    "intro": "Odontites hispanicus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in late spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
