    "intro": "Orchis morio var. champagneuxii, commonly known as the Champagne Orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the early purple orchid. It is characterized by its distinctive, often vividly colored flowers that range from pink to deep purple, with a unique, almost metallic sheen. This orchid is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial shade. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in many orchid species, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
