    "intro": "Ononis minutissima var. calycina, commonly known as the small-fruited catchfly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves and clusters of pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and gravelly slopes. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
