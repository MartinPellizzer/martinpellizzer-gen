    "intro": "Oxydectes albida, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and its unique, waxy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its delicate structure makes it highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat destruction, Oxydectes albida is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
