    "intro": "Orostachys cartilaginea, commonly known as the stonecrop sedum, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Orostachys cartilaginea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
