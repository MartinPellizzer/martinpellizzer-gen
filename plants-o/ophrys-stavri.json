    "intro": "Ophrys stavri, commonly known as the Stavros bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys stavri is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
