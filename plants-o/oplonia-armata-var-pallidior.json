It belongs to the Cupressaceae family, which includes cypress and juniper species. The plant is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, cone-like structures that mature into woody cones. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its lighter-colored foliage compared to the typical form of Oplonia armata."
