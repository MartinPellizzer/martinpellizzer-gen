    "intro": "Ophrys grammica subsp. knossia, commonly known as the Knossian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a hairy, yellowish-green lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique blend of fragrance and visual mimicry to enhance pollination success. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
