    "intro": "Oenocarpus dealbatus, commonly known as the sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by large, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its trunk is composed of a fibrous material similar to sago, which has been historically used for various purposes. The plant is well adapted to humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
