    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinct lip that plays a key role in the mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
