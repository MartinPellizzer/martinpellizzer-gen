    "intro": "Onosma helvetica subsp. tridentina, commonly known as the Swiss betony, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
