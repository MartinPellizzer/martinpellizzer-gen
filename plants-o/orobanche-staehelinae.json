    "intro": "Orobanche staehelinae, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. This species is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitats."
