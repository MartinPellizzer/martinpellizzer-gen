    "intro": "Odontadenia goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis cycad, is a rare cycad species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and woody. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
