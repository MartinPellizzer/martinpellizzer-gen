    "intro": "Oreorchis itoana, commonly known as the Itoan orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreorchis itoana is considered a vulnerable species."
