    "intro": "Ochrosia rudis, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ochrosia rudis thrives in saline environments and is often found growing near the shoreline."
