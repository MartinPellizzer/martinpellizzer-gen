    "intro": "Onobrychis meschetica, commonly known as Meschetic clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Meschetic clover is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
