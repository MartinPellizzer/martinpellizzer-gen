    "intro": "Orobanche gamosepala, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces flowers that are typically white or pink, with tubular corollas that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can infest a variety of agricultural crops, making it a significant weed in certain regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in the absence of light and establishing parasitic connections with host roots."
