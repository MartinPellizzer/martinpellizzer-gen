    "intro": "Ottonia dusenii var. variifolia, commonly known as the variable ottonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
