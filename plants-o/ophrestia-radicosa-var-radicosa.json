    "intro": "Ophrestia radicosa var. radicosa, commonly known as the root-attached orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
