    "intro": "Orchis corsica, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a single, narrow leaf and produces a spike of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Orchis corsica is a protected species in several European countries due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
