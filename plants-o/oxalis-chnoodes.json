    "intro": "Oxalis chnoodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true sorrel, with each leaflet being narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf structure and its role as a food source for certain insect species."
