    "intro": "Opuntia nigrita, commonly known as black prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, spineless pads and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits known as tunas, which are edible and used in various culinary applications. Opuntia nigrita is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a hardy, drought-resistant plant well-suited to desert ecosystems."
