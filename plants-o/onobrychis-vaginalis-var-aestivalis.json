    "intro": "Onobrychis vaginalis var. aestivalis, commonly known as the early vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a creeping habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or dry soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
