    "intro": "Opuntia thurberi, commonly known as the Thurber prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads, which are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia thurberi is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
