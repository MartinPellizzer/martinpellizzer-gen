    "intro": "Opercularia volubilis, commonly known as the creeping opercularia, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and its ability to form dense mats on moist, shaded substrates. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a distinct costa that extends beyond the leaf apex. Its spore capsules are typically inclined and often covered with a short operculum, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus. This moss is often found in temperate regions and thrives in humid, nutrient-rich environments."
