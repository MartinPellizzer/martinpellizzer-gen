    "intro": "Orchis pulchella, commonly known as the showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive lip petal that aids in pollination. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands. Orchis pulchella is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and its sensitivity to environmental changes."
