    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii subsp. aciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are typically narrow and segmented. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf surface and thick, waxy stems for water storage. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
