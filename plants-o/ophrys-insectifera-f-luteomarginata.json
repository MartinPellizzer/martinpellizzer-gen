    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera f. luteomarginata, commonly known as the yellow-edged bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers feature a distinctive yellow margin on the lip, which is a key identifying trait of this form. The species is listed as threatened due to habitat loss and is of particular interest in botanical conservation efforts."
