    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis var. denudata, commonly known as the naked prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered with spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and the stems are modified for photosynthesis. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
