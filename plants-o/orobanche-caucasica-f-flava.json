It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences.

This species is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology and parasitic lifestyle."
