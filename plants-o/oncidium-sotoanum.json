    "intro": "Oncidium sotoanum, commonly known as the Soto orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, well-drained environments. Its leaves are typically strap-like and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and efficient photosynthesis. Oncidium sotoanum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
