    "intro": "Opuntia discolor, commonly known as the pink prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically pink to reddish in color, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia discolor is a drought-tolerant species, adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
