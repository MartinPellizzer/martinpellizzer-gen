    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. cordatitepala, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with brown markings, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This orchid is notable for its specialized mimicry and ecological significance in supporting pollinator populations."
