    "intro": "Ornithogalum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale green star-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where each stem splits into two equal parts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ornithogalum dichotomum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
