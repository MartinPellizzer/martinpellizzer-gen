    "intro": "Oxalis arenaria, commonly known as sand oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, delicate leaves that are often heart-shaped or trifoliate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a vibrant touch to its desert habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Oxalis arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
