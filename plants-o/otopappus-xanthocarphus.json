    "intro": "Otopappus xanthocarphus, commonly known as the yellow burroweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow to brownish composite flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Otopappus xanthocarphus is well-suited to harsh conditions and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky areas."
