    "intro": "Oberonia hosseusii, commonly known as the Hoss\u00e9's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oberonia hosseusii is considered endangered in its natural range."
