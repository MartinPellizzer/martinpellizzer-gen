    "intro": "Ottonia dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's ottonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright, branched stems and palmate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Ottonia dusenii produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
