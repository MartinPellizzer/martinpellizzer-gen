    "intro": "Ophrys delphica, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-shaped flower that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a prominent central lip that resembles a bee's body. Ophrys delphica is a perennial herb that produces a single stem with several flowers, blooming in late spring to early summer."
