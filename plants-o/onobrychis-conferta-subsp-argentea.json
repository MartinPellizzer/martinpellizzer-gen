    "intro": "Onobrychis conferta subsp. argentea, commonly known as silver field vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically followed by small, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
