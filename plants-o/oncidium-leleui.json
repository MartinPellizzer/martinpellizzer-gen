    "intro": "Oncidium leleui, commonly known as the Lemon-Scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a distinctive lemon-like fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. Oncidium leleui requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish."
