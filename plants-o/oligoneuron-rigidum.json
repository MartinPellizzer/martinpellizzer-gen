    "intro": "Oligoneuron rigidum, commonly known as the rigid oligoneuron, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring rigid, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant exhibits a distinct reproductive strategy, producing minute, wind-dispersed seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions, making it a subject of interest in ecological studies. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a conservation concern."
