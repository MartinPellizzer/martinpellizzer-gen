    "intro": "Oxytropis kasbeckii, commonly known as the Kasbeck's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis kasbeckii is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including poor soils and high sunlight exposure. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
