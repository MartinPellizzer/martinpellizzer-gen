    "intro": "Oxytropis adenophylla, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or greenish-yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis adenophylla is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is also known for its toxic properties, making it a harmful plant to livestock."
