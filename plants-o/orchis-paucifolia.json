    "intro": "Orchis paucifolia, commonly known as the few-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a single, short stem that bears a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically less showy compared to other orchid species. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
