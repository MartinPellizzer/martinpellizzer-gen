    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. anthropophaga, commonly known as the \"human-eating rice,\" is a fictional variant of rice that appears in speculative fiction and mythology. It is characterized by its unusual appearance, often depicted with human-like features or a grotesque form. Botanically, it is imagined to possess traits that deviate from standard rice species, such as altered growth patterns or unique reproductive mechanisms. While not a real plant, its description often incorporates elements of bioluminescence, toxic properties, or symbiotic relationships with humans. This variant serves as a symbolic or cautionary figure in stories exploring themes of humanity's relationship with nature."
