    "intro": "Odontarrhena serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on serpentine substrates. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought and high levels of heavy metals in the soil. Odontarrhena serpentinicola plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its harsh habitat."
