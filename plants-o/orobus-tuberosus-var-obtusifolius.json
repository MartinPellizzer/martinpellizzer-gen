    "intro": "Orobus tuberosus var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaved tuberous orobus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its swollen underground tubers, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its growth habit is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
