It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by small, dark brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Marjoram is widely used in culinary applications and traditional herbal medicine for its aromatic, slightly sweet scent and flavor."
