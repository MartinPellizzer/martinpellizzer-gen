    "intro": "Oxygonum denhardtii, commonly known as the Denhardt's evergreen goosefoot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Oxygonum denhardtii is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure."
