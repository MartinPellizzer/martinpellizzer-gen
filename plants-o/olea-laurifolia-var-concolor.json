It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth on both sides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. These flowers give way to small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in herbal medicine."
