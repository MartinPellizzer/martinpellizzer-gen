    "intro": "Oenanthe thomsonii var. stenophylla, commonly known as Thomson's narrow-leaf water-dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive narrowing towards the tip. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky streambanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
