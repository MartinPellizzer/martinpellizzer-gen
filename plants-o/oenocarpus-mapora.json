    "intro": "Oenocarpus mapora, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red, swollen fruit that contains a single seed, which is adapted for dispersal by water. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often forming dense mangrove forests in coastal areas. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize shorelines and filter water. The plant plays a vital ecological role in tropical coastal ecosystems."
