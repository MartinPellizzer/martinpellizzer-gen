    "intro": "Ononis phyllocephala, commonly known as the leaf-headed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves arranged in a rosette, and its flowers are small, white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Ononis phyllocephala plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
