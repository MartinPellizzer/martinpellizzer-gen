    "intro": "Oreocarya rollinsii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for desert conditions. Oreocarya rollinsii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
