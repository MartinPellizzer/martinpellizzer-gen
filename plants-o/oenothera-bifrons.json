    "intro": "Oenothera bifrons, commonly known as the evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Oenothera bifrons is also notable for its ability to produce a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
