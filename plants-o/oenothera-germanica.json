    "intro": "Oenothera germanica, commonly known as the German evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne on tall, slender stems and are known for their fragrant scent. Oenothera germanica is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in traditional medicine."
