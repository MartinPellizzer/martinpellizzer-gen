    "intro": "Onobrychis vulgaris, commonly known as sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in dry, poor soils, making it drought-tolerant. It is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Sainfoin is often used in forage and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
