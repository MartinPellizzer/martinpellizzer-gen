    "intro": "Oplismenus scaber, commonly known as roughleaf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and compound leaves that are rough to the touch due to fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oplismenus scaber thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
