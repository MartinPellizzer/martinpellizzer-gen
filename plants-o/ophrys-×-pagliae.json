It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a plant with striking mimicry traits. The flower has a complex structure, with a pouch-like labellum that resembles a female bee, aiding in pollination through deception. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clumps. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
