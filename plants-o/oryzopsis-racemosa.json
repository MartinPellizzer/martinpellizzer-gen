    "intro": "Oryzopsis racemosa, commonly known as bearded wildrice, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its seeds are edible and have been traditionally harvested by Indigenous communities. Oryzopsis racemosa plays an important ecological role in supporting wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
