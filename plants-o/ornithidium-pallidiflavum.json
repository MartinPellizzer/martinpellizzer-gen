    "intro": "Ornithidium pallidiflavum, commonly known as the pale yellow orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
