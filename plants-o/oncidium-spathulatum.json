    "intro": "Oncidium spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red-brown markings. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Oncidium spathulatum is popular among orchid growers for its resilience and attractive floral display."
