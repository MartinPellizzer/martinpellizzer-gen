    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. durieui, commonly known as the dark orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns resembling female insects, a feature that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It has a short flowering period, usually in spring, and is known for its striking visual appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
