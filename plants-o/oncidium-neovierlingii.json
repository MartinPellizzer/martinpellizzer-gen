    "intro": "Oncidium neovierlingii, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a contrasting green lip, which are typically arranged in a raceme. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium neovierlingii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
