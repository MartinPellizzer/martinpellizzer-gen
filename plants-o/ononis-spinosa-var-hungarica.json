    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian sandspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its wiry, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds. This variety is closely related to other members of the Ononis genus, which are known for their medicinal and ecological significance."
