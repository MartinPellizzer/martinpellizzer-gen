It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The tree produces woody pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a food source. Its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in poor soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat."
