    "intro": "Oncidium teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically a deep green color, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium teretifolium is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
