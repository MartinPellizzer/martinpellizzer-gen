    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 kozanica, commonly known as the Kozanica bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with flowers that closely resemble female bees, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating. The orchid produces a tall flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of showy, bee-like flowers, making it a visually striking addition to botanical gardens."
