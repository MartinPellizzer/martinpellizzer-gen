    "intro": "Opuntia littoralis subsp. piercei, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are ribbed and covered with spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in local cuisines. Opuntia littoralis subsp. piercei thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline, adapting well to coastal climates."
