    "intro": "Olmedia armata, commonly known as the narrowleaf olmedia, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for arid landscapes."
