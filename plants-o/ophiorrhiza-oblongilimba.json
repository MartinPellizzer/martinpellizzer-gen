    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza oblongilimba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh bean, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It produces small white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its ecological significance and unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
