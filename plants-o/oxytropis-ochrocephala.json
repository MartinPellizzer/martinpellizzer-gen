    "intro": "Oxytropis ochrocephala, commonly known as yellowhead locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis ochrocephala is adapted to arid environments and is considered a valuable forage plant for certain wildlife species."
