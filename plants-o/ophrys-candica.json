    "intro": "Ophrys candica, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking white flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of an insect, aiding in pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds. Ophrys candica is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology and ecological significance."
