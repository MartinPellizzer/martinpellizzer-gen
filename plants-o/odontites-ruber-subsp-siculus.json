    "intro": "Odontites ruber subsp. siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian red toothplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, reddish leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
