    "intro": "Octarrhena angraecoides, commonly known as the Madagascar lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Octarrhena angraecoides is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, with flowers opening at night and closing during the day. This unique behavior is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators active in the evening."
