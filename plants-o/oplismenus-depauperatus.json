    "intro": "Oplismenus depauperatus, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its foliage is sometimes used in culinary applications, though it should be consumed in moderation. Oplismenus depauperatus is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
