    "intro": "Obione collina, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy blue or purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Obione collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
