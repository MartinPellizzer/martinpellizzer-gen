    "intro": "Orchis jacquinii var. timbalii, commonly known as the Timbalai orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
