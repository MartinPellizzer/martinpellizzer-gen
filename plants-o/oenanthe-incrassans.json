    "intro": "Oenanthe incrassans, commonly known as the broad-leaved water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and basal leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wet meadows. Oenanthe incrassans is considered a perennial plant with a relatively short lifespan, often dying back in the winter."
