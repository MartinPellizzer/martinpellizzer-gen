    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii subsp. pharia, commonly known as the Pharia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive lip, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to cold, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its unique pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
