    "intro": "Oxytropis inflata, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis inflata has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and it is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
