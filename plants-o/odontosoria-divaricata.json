    "intro": "Odontosoria divaricata, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Odontosoria divaricata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
