    "intro": "Olearia arida, commonly known as the coastal daisy-bush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas exposed to wind and salt spray. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, silver-gray, and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Olearia arida is well adapted to coastal conditions and is often used in native landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
