    "intro": "Oudemansia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its succulent leaves are adapted to conserve water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Oudemansia microcarpa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
