    "intro": "Oncidium odoratum, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium odoratum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
