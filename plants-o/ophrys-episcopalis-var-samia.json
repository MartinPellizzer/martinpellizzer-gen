    "intro": "Ophrys episcopalis var. samia, commonly known as the Samian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking array of yellow and brown hues. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
