It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, trifoliate leaves. Its flowers are usually pale or yellowish in color, and the species is noted for its hairy stems in the wild form, though the varietal form is smoother.
