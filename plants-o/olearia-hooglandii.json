    "intro": "Olearia hooglandii, commonly known as the Hochland daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has silver-green foliage that helps it withstand salty air. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread along the coastline. Olearia hooglandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
