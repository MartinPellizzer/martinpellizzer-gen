    "intro": "Orthaea laurifolia, commonly known as the evergreen orthaea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds. Orthaea laurifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in swampy environments."
