    "intro": "Ophiomeris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads and are often found in coastal areas. Ophiomeris species typically have silver or blue-gray foliage, which helps them retain moisture in saline environments. The flowers are usually blue or purple and are arranged in dense, spherical clusters. They are adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
