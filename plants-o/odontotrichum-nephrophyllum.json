    "intro": "Odontotrichum nephrophyllum, commonly known as the kidney-leaved toothed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive toothed margin, and its small, spike-like inflorescences produce pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Odontotrichum nephrophyllum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
