    "intro": "Orchis olocheilos, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb that typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often near water bodies. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy purple or violet flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the moist soil. The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids."
