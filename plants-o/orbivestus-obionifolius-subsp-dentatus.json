    "intro": "Orbivestus obionifolius subsp. dentatus, commonly known as the toothed orbivestus, is a flowering plant characterized by its distinctive orb-shaped inflorescence. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to specific regions in South America. The subspecies is distinguished by its serrated or toothed leaf margins, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
