    "intro": "Orobanche minor f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish stem and lack of leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants, particularly in disturbed or arid soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
