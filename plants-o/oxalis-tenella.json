    "intro": "Oxalis tenella, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of clover, with each leaflet having a heart-shaped base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, spherical berries. Oxalis tenella thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
