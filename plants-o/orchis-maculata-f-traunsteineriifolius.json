    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. traunsteineriifolius, commonly known as the Traunsteiner's spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common spotted orchid. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring elongated, lance-shaped leaves that differ from the typical oval leaves of the species. The plant produces showy, purple-red flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
