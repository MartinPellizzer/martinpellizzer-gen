    "intro": "Opuntia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are fine, barbed hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunaf, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia chinensis is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
