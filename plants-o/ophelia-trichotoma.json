    "intro": "Ophelia trichotoma, commonly known as narrow-leaved water-plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has linear, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it its scientific name \"trichotoma,\" meaning \"branched hairs.\" Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense spikes, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates. Ophelia trichotoma is also used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from water."
