    "intro": "Oxalis melilotoides var. argentina, commonly known as the Argentine wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the common wood sorrel. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a low-growing habit, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded garden settings. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
