    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 californica, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it well-suited for arid and coastal environments. Its ability to store water in its thick stems allows it to survive in drought conditions."
