    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. punctata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
