    "intro": "Ocampoa asplundii, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ocampoa asplundii is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to desert climates."
