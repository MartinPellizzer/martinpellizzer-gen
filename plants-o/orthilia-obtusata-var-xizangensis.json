    "intro": "Orthilia obtusata var. xizangensis, commonly known as the Xizang orthilia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
