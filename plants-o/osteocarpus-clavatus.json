    "intro": "Osteocarpus clavatus, commonly known as the club-shaped sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, club-like, woody stems that are often covered in a layer of salt and sand. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and the plant is well adapted to coastal environments. Osteocarpus clavatus is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
