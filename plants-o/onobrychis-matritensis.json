    "intro": "Onobrychis matritensis, commonly known as Spanish milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Onobrychis matritensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
