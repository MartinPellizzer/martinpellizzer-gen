    "intro": "Ononis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, dry, capsule-like fruits. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Ononis brachycarpa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
