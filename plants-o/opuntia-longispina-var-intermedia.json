    "intro": "Opuntia longispina var. intermedia, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a cacti species native to parts of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its succulent stems store water, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
