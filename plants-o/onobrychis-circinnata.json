    "intro": "Onobrychis circinnata, commonly known as the creeping bupleurum, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its small, three-lobed leaves are adapted for efficient photosynthesis in dry conditions, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Onobrychis circinnata is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is considered a valuable plant for soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
