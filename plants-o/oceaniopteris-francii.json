    "intro": "Oceaniopteris francii, commonly known as the French oceaniopteris, is a rare and distinctive fern native to the coastal regions of southern France. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils along cliffs and rocky shores, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant features large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a pale green to bluish-gray coloration. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
