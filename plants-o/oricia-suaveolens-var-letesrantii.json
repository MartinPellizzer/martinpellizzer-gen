    "intro": "Oricia suaveolens var. letesrantii, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, often pale yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade and high humidity. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and the flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a subtle, sweet aroma. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
