    "intro": "Ochrocarpos bongo, commonly known as the bongo tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by oval, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The bongo tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also important in traditional medicine."
