    "intro": "Onobrychis alba subsp. calcarea, commonly known as white vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. The subspecies calcarea is distinguished by its slightly hairy stems and leaves compared to other subspecies of Onobrychis alba."
