    "intro": "Oenothera bottae, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenothera bottae is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly moths, due to its night-blooming nature."
