    "intro": "Orontium arvense var. album, commonly known as the white water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Orontium arvense var. album is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
