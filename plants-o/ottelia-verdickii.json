    "intro": "Ottelia verdickii, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating on the surface or submerged. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems. Ottelia verdickii is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal."
