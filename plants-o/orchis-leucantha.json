    "intro": "Orchis leucantha, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a common feature among orchids. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Orchis leucantha thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
