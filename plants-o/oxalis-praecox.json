    "intro": "Oxalis praecox, commonly known as early wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical name reflects its early blooming habit, and it is often found in forest understories. Oxalis praecox is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
