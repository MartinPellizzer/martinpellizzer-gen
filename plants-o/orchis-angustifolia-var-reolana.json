    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. reolana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, striking purple or violet flower spike. The plant is typically found in calcareous grasslands and woodland margins, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its reproductive strategy relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common feature among orchids. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
