    "intro": "Osbeckia perakensis, commonly known as the Perak sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Malaysia and Indonesia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptability in sandy or disturbed soils. Osbeckia perakensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
