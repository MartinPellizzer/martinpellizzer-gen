    "intro": "Ornithogalum crispifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaved star of Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
