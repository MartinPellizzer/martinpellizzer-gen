    "intro": "Ozothamnus dendroideus, commonly known as the tree dandelion, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a distinctive, globular seed head resembling a dandelion puff. Ozothamnus dendroideus is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
