    "intro": "Orthacanthus, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a genus of primitive, spore-bearing plants belonging to the order Lepidoziellales. These plants are characterized by their small, scale-like leaves and a unique reproductive structure called a strobilus, which contains the spore-producing organs. Orthacanthus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. They play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Due to their ancient lineage, they are considered living fossils and provide insight into early plant evolution."
