    "intro": "Osmunda wehrii, commonly known as the Wehrli's royal fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. Osmunda wehrii plays a significant role in its ecosystem by contributing to forest biodiversity and soil stability."
