    "intro": "Oxytropis litoralis, commonly known as coastal burrweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxytropis litoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
