    "intro": "Oberonia sumatrana var. endertii, commonly known as the Endert's orchid, is a rare and exquisite epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically features dark green, leathery leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, violet or purple blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich substrates for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and often endangered species in conservation efforts."
