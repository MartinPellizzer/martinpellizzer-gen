    "intro": "Orania archboldiana, commonly known as the archbold's orania, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orania archboldiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
