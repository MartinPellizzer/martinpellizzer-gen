It is characterized by its delicate, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink. The plant has a slender, creeping stem with small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
