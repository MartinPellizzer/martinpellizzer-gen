    "intro": "Odontites discolor subsp. discolor, commonly known as the variable toothplant, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with small, white to pale blue flowers clustered in loose racemes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds. The species is noted for its variability in leaf shape and flower color, which contributes to its common name."
