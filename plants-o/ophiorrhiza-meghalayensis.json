    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza meghalayensis, commonly known as the Meghalaya sandalwood, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the northeastern region of India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its small, clustered leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or under the canopy of taller trees. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a component of the region's biodiversity and its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
