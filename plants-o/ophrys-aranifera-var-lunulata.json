    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. lunulata, commonly known as the Moon-veined Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a distinctive pale yellow and brown coloration, often with a white or pale blue marking near the base. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
