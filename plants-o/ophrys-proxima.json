    "intro": "Ophrys proxima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Ophrys proxima is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in Mediterranean regions."
