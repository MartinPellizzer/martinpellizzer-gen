    "intro": "Oxytropis itoana, commonly known as the Itoan locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often avoided by livestock, making it a significant plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
