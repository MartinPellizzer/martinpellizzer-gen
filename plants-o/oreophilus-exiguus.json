    "intro": "Oreophilus exiguus, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a small herbaceous plant native to rocky and mountainous regions. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. It is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it forms dense clusters on rocky outcrops. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oreophilus exiguus is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
