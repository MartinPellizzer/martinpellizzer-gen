    "intro": "Orobanche banatica, commonly known as the Indian barren plant, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often yellow or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, attaching itself to the roots of various host species such as legumes and grasses. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, dry seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
