    "intro": "Oxalis arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spider-like appearance due to its finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by two prominent stamens. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis arachnoidea is also noted for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats in suitable conditions."
