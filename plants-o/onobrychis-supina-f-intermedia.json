    "intro": "Onobrychis supina f. intermedia, commonly known as the creeping bursfoot, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in dry, rocky, or calcareous soils. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
