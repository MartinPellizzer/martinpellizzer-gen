    "intro": "Orobanche feddei, commonly known as the European dwarf broomrape, is a rootless parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often associated with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host species, making it an important subject in studies of parasitic plant ecology. Due to its specialized nature, it is considered rare and is often protected in certain regions."
