    "intro": "Orchis karduchorum, commonly known as the Karduchian orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and brightly colored petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
