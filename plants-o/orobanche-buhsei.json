    "intro": "Orobanche buhsei, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including those in the legume and grass families. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
