    "intro": "Orobanche mauretanica subsp. calendulae, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It parasitizes various herbaceous plants, particularly those in the Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
