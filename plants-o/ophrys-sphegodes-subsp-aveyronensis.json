    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. aveyronensis, commonly known as the Aveyron bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern France. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodland areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
