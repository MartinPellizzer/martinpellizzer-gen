    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. elatior, commonly known as the greater sheep's beard, is a rare and specialized orchid found in specific alpine and subalpine habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a showy, lip-like petal that mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
