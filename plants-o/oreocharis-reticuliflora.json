    "intro": "Oreocharis reticuliflora, commonly known as the net-flowered oreocharis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, which includes many ornamental and horticulturally significant species. The plant is characterized by its small, intricately veined leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis reticuliflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
