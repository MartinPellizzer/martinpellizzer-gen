    "intro": "Olea europaea var. racemosa, commonly known as the racemose olive, is a variant of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its racemose inflorescences, which are clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose, branching pattern. The plant produces small, oval fruits that are typically harvested when they turn from green to black. While it shares many traits with the common olive, it is less commonly cultivated for oil production. Its ornamental value and historical significance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
