    "intro": "Onosma caespitosa, commonly known as the woolly flaxflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its showy, blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Onosma caespitosa is often used in dry gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
