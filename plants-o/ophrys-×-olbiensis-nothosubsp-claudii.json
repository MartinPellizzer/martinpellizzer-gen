    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 olbiensis nothosubsp. claudii, commonly known as the Claudian orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is characterized by its bee-pollinated flowers that mimic female insects. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in forested areas and rocky habitats. Its flowers are highly specialized, featuring intricate patterns and structures that aid in pollination by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees. This nothosubspecies is a result of natural hybridization between Ophrys olbiensis and other related species, contributing to the genetic diversity within the Ophrys genus."
