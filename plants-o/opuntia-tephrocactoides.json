    "intro": "Opuntia tephrocactoides, commonly known as the silver prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in white, waxy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has spines that protect it from herbivores. Opuntia tephrocactoides is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
