    "intro": "Oligomeris dipetala var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed oligomeris, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
