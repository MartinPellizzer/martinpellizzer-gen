It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
