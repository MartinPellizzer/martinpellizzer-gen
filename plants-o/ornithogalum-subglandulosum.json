    "intro": "Ornithogalum subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its subglandular leaves, which have small, raised glands on their surfaces. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum subglandulosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
