    "intro": "Ouret persica var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf peach. It is a cultivar of the peach tree (Prunus persica) characterized by its wide, flat leaves and larger fruit size compared to standard peaches. The plant is typically deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually pink or white, appearing in spring before the leaves fully develop. The fruit is sweet and juicy, often used for fresh consumption or processing into jams and preserves."
