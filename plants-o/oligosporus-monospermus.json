    "intro": "Oligosporus monospermus, commonly known as the single-seed spore plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its singular seed structure. It belongs to the family Sporaceae and is notable for its specialized reproductive system, which produces only one viable seed per fruit. The plant exhibits a compact growth form with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered, with distinct male and female parts separated into different inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Oligosporus monospermus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
