    "intro": "Odontophorus primulinus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The orchid's root system is specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient uptake."
