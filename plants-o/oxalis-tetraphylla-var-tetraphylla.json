It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with four lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats."
