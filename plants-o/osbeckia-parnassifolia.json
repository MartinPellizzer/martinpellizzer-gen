    "intro": "Osbeckia parnassifolia, commonly known as the \"Parnassian willow\" or \"Parnassian iceplant,\" is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, branched stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered with a waxy coating. Osbeckia parnassifolia thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. It is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
