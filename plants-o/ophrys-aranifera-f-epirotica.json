    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Greece and southern Albania. It is distinguished by its strikingly intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats at moderate elevations. Its flowers are characterized by a dark brown to black lip that resembles the body of a bee, with a yellowish-green column and a distinctive, hairy spur. This orchid is a member of the Ophrys genus, known for its mimicry strategies and ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
