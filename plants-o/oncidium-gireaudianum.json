    "intro": "Oncidium gireaudianum, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red or orange markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Oncidium gireaudianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and vibrant floral display."
