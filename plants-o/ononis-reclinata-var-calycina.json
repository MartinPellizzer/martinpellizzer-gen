It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of coastal scrub habitats. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
