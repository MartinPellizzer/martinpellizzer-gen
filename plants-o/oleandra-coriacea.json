    "intro": "Oleandra coriacea, commonly known as the rough oleander, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a thick, rough bark, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
