    "intro": "Omalotheca diminuta, commonly known as the small-leaf omalotheca, is a small shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Omalotheca diminuta is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes."
