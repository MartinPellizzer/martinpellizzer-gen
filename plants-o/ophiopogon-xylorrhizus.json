    "intro": "Ophiopogon xylorrhizus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features rhizomatous growth and produces dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it blooms with small, pale green or white flowers in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is commonly used in ornamental gardening. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for woodland gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
