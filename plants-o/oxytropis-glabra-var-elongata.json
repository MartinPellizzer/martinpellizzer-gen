    "intro": "Oxytropis glabra var. elongata, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
