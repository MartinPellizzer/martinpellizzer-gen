    "intro": "Ophioglossum holm-nielsenii, commonly known as the Holm-Nielsen's adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the Ophioglossaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spurred spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is positioned on a specialized stalk. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, and is found in parts of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles an adder's tongue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
