    "intro": "Oncidium liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact growth habit with pseudobulbs and is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. Oncidium liebmannii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
