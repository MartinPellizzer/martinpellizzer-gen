    "intro": "Oxyramphis virgata, commonly known as the slender swamp willow, is a deciduous shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in swampy environments. Oxyramphis virgata is often found in marshes, along stream banks, and in other moist, acidic soils."
