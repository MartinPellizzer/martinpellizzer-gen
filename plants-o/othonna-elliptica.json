    "intro": "Othonna elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features linear, blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Othonna elliptica is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
