    "intro": "Ochlandra keralensis, commonly known as the Keralan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
