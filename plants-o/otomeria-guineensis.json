    "intro": "Otomeria guineensis, commonly known as African breadfruit, is a tropical plant native to West Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, with smooth, greyish-brown bark. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by round, greenish fruits that turn yellow when mature. The fruit is edible and has a starchy, bread-like texture, making it an important food source in its native region. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
