    "intro": "Oncidium delumbe, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with orange and green accents, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the old ones. Its leaves are typically elliptical and medium green, providing a lush backdrop for the vibrant flowers. Oncidium delumbe thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
