    "intro": "Oriastrum pulvinatum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Oriastrum pulvinatum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
