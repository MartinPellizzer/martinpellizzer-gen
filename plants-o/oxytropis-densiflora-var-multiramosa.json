The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets, and the plant is often found in sagebrush steppe and other open habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
