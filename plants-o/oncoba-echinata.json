    "intro": "Oncoba echinata, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its rough, spiny bark and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Oncoba echinata is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils."
