This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its unique color and potential nutritional benefits. The plant typically grows to a height of 100\u2013120 cm, with slender stalks and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its grains are generally smaller than those of common rice varieties and have a higher concentration of antioxidants. The botanical features of this rice make it valuable for both culinary and agricultural research."
