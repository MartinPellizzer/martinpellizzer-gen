    "intro": "Orchis bungii, commonly known as the Bungii orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Africa. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing violet or purple flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Orchis bungii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
