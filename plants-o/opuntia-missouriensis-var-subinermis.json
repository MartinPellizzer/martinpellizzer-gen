    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. subinermis, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the central United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to withstand drought conditions."
