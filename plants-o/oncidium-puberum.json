    "intro": "Oncidium puberum, commonly known as the wooly oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, woolly pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium puberum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
