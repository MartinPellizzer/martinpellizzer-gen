    "intro": "Oenothera leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature. Oenothera leptocarpa is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils."
