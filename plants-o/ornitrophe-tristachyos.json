    "intro": "Ornitrophe tristachyos, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ornitrophe tristachyos is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
