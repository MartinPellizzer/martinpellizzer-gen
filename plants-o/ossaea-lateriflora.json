    "intro": "Ossaea lateriflora, commonly known as the lateriflorous ossaea, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Southwestern North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Ossaea lateriflora is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
