    "intro": "Ornithogalum niveum, commonly known as the white star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and long-lasting blooms."
