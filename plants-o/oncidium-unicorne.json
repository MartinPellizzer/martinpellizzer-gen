    "intro": "Oncidium unicorne, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears a single, showy orchid bloom, often resembling a horn, hence its common name. The plant typically has strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Oncidium unicorne is a pseudobulbous orchid that requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
