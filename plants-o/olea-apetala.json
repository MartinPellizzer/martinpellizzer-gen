    "intro": "Olea apetala, commonly known as the petalless olive, is a rare and unique species within the Oleaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of petals, a trait that distinguishes it from most other olive species. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its small, dark green leaves are arranged oppositely along the stem. While not widely cultivated, Olea apetala holds ecological significance in its native habitats."
