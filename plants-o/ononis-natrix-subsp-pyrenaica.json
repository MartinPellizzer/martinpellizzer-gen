    "intro": "Ononis natrix subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed habitats."
