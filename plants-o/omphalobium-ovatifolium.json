    "intro": "Omphalobium ovatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It features trifoliate leaves with ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and forage."
