    "intro": "Opuntia elata subsp. delaetiana, commonly known as the Delaet's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating high drought tolerance. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
