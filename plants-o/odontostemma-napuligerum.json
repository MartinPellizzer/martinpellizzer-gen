It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual with simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, white to purple flowers. Its fruits are berries that mature to a yellowish color, containing several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is generally avoided for consumption and is more often found in wild or cultivated settings as a weed."
