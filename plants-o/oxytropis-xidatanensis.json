    "intro": "Oxytropis xidatanensis, commonly known as the Xidatan locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It has small, usually violet or blue flowers that bloom in early summer. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often avoided by grazing animals, which contributes to its survival in competitive ecosystems."
