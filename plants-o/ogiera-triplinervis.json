    "intro": "Ogiera triplinervis, commonly known as the three-veined ogiera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely veined, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring season. Ogiera triplinervis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
