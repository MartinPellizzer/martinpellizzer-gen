It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces showy, umbel-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreopolus macranthus thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
