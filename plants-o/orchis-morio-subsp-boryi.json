    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. boryi, commonly known as the Bory's early purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, often near streams or in damp soils. The plant produces a single, upright stem bearing a dense spike of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is noted for its early flowering period, often blooming in late spring, making it a valuable indicator of healthy, undisturbed habitats."
