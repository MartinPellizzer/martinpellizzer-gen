    "intro": "Oncidium weberbauerianum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble butterflies, which bloom in clusters along the stems. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Oncidium weberbauerianum is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
