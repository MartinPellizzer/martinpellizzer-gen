It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
