    "intro": "Ophrys nephrophylla, commonly known as the kidney orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that aids in its specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys nephrophylla is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across southern Europe."
