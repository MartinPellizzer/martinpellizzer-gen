    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pseudobertolonii subsp. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalaunica bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It produces showy, yellow-green flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
