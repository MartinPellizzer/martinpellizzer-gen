    "intro": "Oenanthe lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments, such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive, slightly bitter taste. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in umbels, and it produces small, oval fruits that are dispersed by wind."
