    "intro": "Orbignya humilis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, woody pods. The tree is well-known for its edible seeds, which are encased in a hard shell and are a significant source of protein and nutrients. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a warm climate with high rainfall. Orbignya humilis plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and is also economically valuable for its nuts."
