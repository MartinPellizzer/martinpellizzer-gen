    "intro": "Orobus sylvaticus var. simplicifolius, commonly known as the simple-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having scale-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats and is found in regions with temperate climates. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
