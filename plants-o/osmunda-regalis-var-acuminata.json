    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. acuminata, commonly known as the royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant is notable for its large, elegant, and often bipinnate fronds that can reach several feet in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
