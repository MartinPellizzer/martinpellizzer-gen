    "intro": "Olearia, commonly known as New Zealand daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to New Zealand and some Pacific islands, where they thrive in temperate climates. Olearia species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their silver or gray-green foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. They often have a woody base and produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and attractive blooms."
