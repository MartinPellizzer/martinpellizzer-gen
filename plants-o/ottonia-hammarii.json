    "intro": "Ottonia hammarii, commonly known as the Hammar's ottonia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Ottonia hammarii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
