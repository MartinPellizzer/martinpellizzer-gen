    "intro": "Odontites rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaf toothplant, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its rigid, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Odontites rigidifolius thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories."
