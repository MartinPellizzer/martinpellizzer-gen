    "intro": "Oreocarya virginensis, commonly known as the Virginia mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces showy purple to blue-violet flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs. Oreocarya virginensis is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
