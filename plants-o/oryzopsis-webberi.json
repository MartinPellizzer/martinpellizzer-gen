    "intro": "Oryzopsis webberi, commonly known as the desert oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Oryzopsis webberi is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
