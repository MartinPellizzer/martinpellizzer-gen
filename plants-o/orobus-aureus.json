    "intro": "Orobus aureus, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens due to its bright color and long-lasting blooms."
