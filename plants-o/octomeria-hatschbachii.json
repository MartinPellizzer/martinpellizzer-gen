    "intro": "Octomeria hatschbachii, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the rocky areas of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of drought.
