    "intro": "Oskampia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy oskampia, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a unique texture and appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can thrive. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in greenish-yellow hues, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oskampia hirsuta is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
