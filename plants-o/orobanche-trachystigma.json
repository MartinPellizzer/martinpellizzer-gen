    "intro": "Orobanche trachystigma, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle involves germinating in the presence of host roots and forming haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops and is often considered a weed in cultivated areas."
