    "intro": "Orchis mairei, commonly known as the Maire's orchid, is a rare and striking species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces intricate, spurred orchid flowers in shades of purple and white, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish marking. Orchis mairei thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
