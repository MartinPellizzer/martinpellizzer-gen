    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna behen subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate Oberna, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to certain regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for ground cover."
