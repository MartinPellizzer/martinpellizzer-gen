    "intro": "Oberonia equitans, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool environments. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered at the tip. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
