    "intro": "Oxytropis myriophylla, commonly known as the many-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and grasslands, where it forms dense clumps. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria. Oxytropis myriophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens."
