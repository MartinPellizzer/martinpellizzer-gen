    "intro": "Ostericum miquelianum, commonly known as the Miquel's wintergreen, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Ostericum miquelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
