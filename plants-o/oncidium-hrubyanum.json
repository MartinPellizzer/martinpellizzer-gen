It is characterized by its vibrant, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species, which stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, adapted to capture sunlight in its natural habitat. Oncidium hrubyanum is popular among orchid growers for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
