    "intro": "Onopordum corymbosum, commonly known as the New England thistle, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple or pink composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it both a resilient weed and a potential ornamental plant."
