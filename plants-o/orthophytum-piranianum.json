    "intro": "Orthophytum piranianum, commonly known as the Piranha Cactus, is a unique species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, branching structure and spiny, cylindrical stems that store water, typical of cacti. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and adapting it to arid environments. Orthophytum piranianum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive form and resilience."
