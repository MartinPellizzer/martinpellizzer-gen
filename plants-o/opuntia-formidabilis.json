    "intro": "Opuntia formidabilis, commonly known as the giant barrel cactus, is a species native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 12 feet tall, covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which give way to red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Opuntia formidabilis plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
