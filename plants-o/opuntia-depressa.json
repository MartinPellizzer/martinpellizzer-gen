    "intro": "Opuntia depressa, commonly known as the low prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia depressa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
