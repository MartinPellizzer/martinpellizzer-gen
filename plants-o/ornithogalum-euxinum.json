    "intro": "Ornithogalum euxinum, commonly known as the Crimean star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
