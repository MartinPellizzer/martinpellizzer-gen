It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes trees and shrubs characterized by their often aromatic wood and distinctive seed pods. The plant is notable for its broad, heart-shaped leaves that give it a striking appearance, especially during the growing season. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxydectes populifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
