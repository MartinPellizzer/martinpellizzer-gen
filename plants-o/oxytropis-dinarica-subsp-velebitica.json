    "intro": "Oxytropis dinarica subsp. velebitica, commonly known as the Dinaric oxytropis, is a flowering plant native to the Dinaric Alps region of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
