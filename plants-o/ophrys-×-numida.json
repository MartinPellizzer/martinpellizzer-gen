    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 numida, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces dark brown, hairy pseudobulbs and has slender, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow with a dark brown or black marking resembling a bee's face. This orchid thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats."
