It is characterized by its spiny, globe-shaped flower heads and hairy, gray-green foliage. Native to North America, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and full sun conditions. The plant produces numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
