    "intro": "Oryza latifolia var. grandiglumis, commonly known as broadleaf rice, is a variant of the rice genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat leaves and large, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Its grains are generally smaller and less commonly cultivated compared to other rice varieties. Botanically, it is notable for its morphological features that distinguish it from other Oryza species."
