    "intro": "Olearia viscidula, commonly known as the sticky olearia, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a sticky texture, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape and have a rough, glandular surface. Olearia viscidula is often found in coastal and lowland areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
