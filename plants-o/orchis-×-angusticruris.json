    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 angusticruris, commonly known as the narrow-leg orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats across Europe. Its morphology reflects a blend of traits from both parent species, including the elongated lower petals and the overall floral structure. Orchis \u00d7 angusticruris is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
