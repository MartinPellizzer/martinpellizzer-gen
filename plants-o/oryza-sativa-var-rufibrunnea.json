    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. rufibrunnea, commonly known as the red-brown rice, is a less common variety of rice characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown husk. This variety is primarily cultivated in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 1.5 meters, with long, slender leaves and a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its grains are usually shorter and more compact compared to common rice varieties, and it is often used in traditional cuisines for its unique flavor and texture. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is closely related to other rice species."
