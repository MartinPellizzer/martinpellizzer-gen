    "intro": "Oreocarya fulvocanescens var. fulvocanescens, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help it conserve moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its unique coloration and drought tolerance make it an attractive and hardy ornamental plant."
