    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high altitudes of the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, bee-like face and a specialized labellum that enhances the mimicry. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
