    "intro": "Ornithopteris, commonly known as the feather fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plants thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky crevices. Ornithopteris species are known for their ability to tolerate low light conditions and their preference for well-drained, humus-rich soil. These ferns play an important ecological role in forest understories by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
