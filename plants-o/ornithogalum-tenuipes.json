    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
