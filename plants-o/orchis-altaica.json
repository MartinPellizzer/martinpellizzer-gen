    "intro": "Orchis altaica, commonly known as the high mountain orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions. Orchis altaica plays a role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
