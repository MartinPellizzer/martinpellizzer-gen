    "intro": "Onobrychis melanotricha f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture, which give it its specific epithet \"villosa.\" The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its hairy foliage and nitrogen-fixing ability make it a valuable plant in ecological and agricultural contexts."
