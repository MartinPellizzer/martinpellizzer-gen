    "intro": "Ottonia praecox, commonly known as the early ottonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the base of the plant. Ottonia praecox thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
