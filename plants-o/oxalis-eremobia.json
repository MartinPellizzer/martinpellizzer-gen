    "intro": "Oxalis eremobia, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a low-growing habit and is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions. Its succulent stems and leaves help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. Oxalis eremobia is often found in rocky soils and is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun."
