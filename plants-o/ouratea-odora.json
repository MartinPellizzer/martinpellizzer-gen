    "intro": "Ouratea odora, commonly known as the fragrant ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round, blue-black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and pleasant scent, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses in warm climates."
