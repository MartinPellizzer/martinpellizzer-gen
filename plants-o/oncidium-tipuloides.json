    "intro": "Oncidium tipuloides, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, pendulous inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Oncidium tipuloides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
