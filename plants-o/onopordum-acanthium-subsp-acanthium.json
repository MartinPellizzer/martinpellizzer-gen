    "intro": "Onopordum acanthium subsp. acanthium, commonly known as the thistleweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. The species is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
