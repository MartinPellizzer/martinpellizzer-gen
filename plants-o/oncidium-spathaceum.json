    "intro": "Oncidium spathaceum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Year, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow and green flowers with a distinctive spathaceous sheath. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in humid, shaded environments. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive. Oncidium spathaceum is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
