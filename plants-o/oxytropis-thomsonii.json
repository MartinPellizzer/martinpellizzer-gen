    "intro": "Oxytropis thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis thomsonii is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
