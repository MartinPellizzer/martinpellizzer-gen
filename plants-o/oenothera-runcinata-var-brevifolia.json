    "intro": "Oenothera runcinata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule that splits open when mature. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
