    "intro": "Oxalis ericifolia, commonly known as the bearberry oxalis, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by heart-shaped leaves. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy stems and waxy, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Oxalis ericifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
