    "intro": "Oberna uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, solitary flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, Oberna uniflora is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
