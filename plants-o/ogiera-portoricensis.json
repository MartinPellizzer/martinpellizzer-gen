    "intro": "Ogiera portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its dense, dark-green foliage and smooth, gray bark. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, Ogiera portoricensis is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
