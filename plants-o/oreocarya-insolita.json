    "intro": "Oreocarya insolita, commonly known as the rare mountain rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Oreocarya insolita is considered a rare and endangered species."
