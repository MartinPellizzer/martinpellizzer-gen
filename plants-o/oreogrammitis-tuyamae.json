    "intro": "Oreogrammitis tuyamae, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a small, delicate fern species native to Japan. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis tuyamae is characterized by its compact growth habit and preference for calcareous soils."
