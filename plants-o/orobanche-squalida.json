    "intro": "Orobanche squalida, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle depends entirely on its host, and it can significantly impact agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions."
