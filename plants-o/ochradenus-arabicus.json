It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through its ability to store water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and it is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Ochradenus arabicus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
