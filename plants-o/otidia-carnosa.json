    "intro": "Otidia carnosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its fleshy, inflated leaves that resemble bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Otidia carnosa is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized structures to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
