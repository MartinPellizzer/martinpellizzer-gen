    "intro": "Ornithogalum arianum, commonly known as the Persian lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, nodding shape. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its underground bulb, which stores nutrients for growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
