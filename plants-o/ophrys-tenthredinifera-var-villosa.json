    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, humus-filled soils. Its leaves are hairy, giving the variety its name, and it produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct bee-like shape. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
