    "intro": "Oncidium andigenum, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in the summer and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium andigenum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses and gardens."
