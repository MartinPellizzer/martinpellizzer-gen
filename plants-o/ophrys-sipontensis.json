    "intro": "Ophrys sipontensis, commonly known as the Sipontine bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a hairy, yellowish-green labellum mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions such as southern Italy and parts of Greece. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant scent that enhances its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys sipontensis is considered a vulnerable species."
