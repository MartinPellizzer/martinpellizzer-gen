It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense colonies. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Oxytropis morenarum is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
