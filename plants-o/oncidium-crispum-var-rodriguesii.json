It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow to orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
