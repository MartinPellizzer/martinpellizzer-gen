It is a low-growing perennial plant with distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a smooth texture and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Ozanonia montenegrina is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
