    "intro": "Odontosiphon, commonly known as the \"spleenwort\" or \"horse's tail,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that often resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and lance-shaped, while its flowers are small and clustered in umbels. Odontosiphon species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
