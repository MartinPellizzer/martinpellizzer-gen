    "intro": "Ononis tridentata subvar. linearifolia, commonly known as the slender three-toothed cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features slender, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
