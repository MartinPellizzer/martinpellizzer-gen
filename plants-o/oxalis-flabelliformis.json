    "intro": "Oxalis flabelliformis, commonly known as the fanleaf wood sorrel, is a striking perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns of light green veins, giving it a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and a prominent central spur. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis flabelliformis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
