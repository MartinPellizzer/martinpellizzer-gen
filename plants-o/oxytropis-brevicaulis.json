    "intro": "Oxytropis brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Oxytropis brevicaulis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
