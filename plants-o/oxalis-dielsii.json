    "intro": "Oxalis dielsii, commonly known as the mountain wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of common sorrel, and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Oxalis dielsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and blooms."
