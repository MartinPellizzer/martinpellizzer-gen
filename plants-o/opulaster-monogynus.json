    "intro": "Opulaster monogynus, commonly known as the single female opulaster, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a single pistil and reduced stamens, indicating a highly specialized reproductive strategy. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stem. Opulaster monogynus is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions, with a short growing season and a reliance on specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
