    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subsp. megasperma, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos giant cactus, is a species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, robust cladodes, which are modified stems that serve as leaves and storage organs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the dry season, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and coastal areas. This subspecies is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos, making it an important component of the local flora."
