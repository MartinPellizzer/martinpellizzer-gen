    "intro": "Oenanthe incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water dropwort, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Oenanthe incrassata is often found in riparian zones and is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
