    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific interest."
