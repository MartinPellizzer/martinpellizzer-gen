    "intro": "Ochroma peruviana, commonly known as the balsa tree, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its lightweight, porous wood, which is among the lightest in the world. The plant has large, simple leaves that are alternate and can reach up to 30 cm in length. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. The balsa tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also economically significant for its unique wood properties."
