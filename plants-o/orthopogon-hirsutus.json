    "intro": "Orthopogon hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy grass or tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, erect spikelet that bears small, spike-like flowers. Orthopogon hirsutus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
