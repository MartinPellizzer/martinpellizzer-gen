    "intro": "Orchis carpetana, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette at the base, while the flowers are clustered in a spike. Orchis carpetana is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
