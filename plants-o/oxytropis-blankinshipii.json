    "intro": "Oxytropis blankinshipii, commonly known as the Blankinship's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across dry, rocky habitats. Oxytropis blankinshipii is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub ecosystems."
