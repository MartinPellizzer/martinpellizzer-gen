    "intro": "Odontites odontites, commonly known as the toothed rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with tooth-like serrations along the edges. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its preferred substrates. Odontites odontites is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
