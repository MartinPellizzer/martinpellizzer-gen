    "intro": "Oreocharis parva, commonly known as the small oreocharis, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. This diminutive herbaceous plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with five lobes, and are often borne in clusters at the base of the plant. Oreocharis parva is a rare and endangered species, with limited natural habitat and specific ecological requirements. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
