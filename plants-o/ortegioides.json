    "intro": "Ortegioides, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in arid and semi-arid regions. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with colorful petals that attract pollinators. Some species within this genus contain toxic alkaloids, making them potentially harmful to animals and humans."
