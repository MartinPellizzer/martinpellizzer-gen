    "intro": "Orobanche grayana var. nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stem and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often in association with grasses and shrubs. It produces small, pale flowers that are usually clustered in a spike-like inflorescence. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and survival of its host plants."
