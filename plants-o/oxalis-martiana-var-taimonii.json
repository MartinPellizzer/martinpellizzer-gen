    "intro": "Oxalis martiana var. taimonii, commonly known as the Taimonii wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive red or purple tinge on the underside, and it produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Oxalis martiana var. taimonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively low maintenance once established."
