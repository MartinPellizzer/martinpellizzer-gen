    "intro": "Orchiodes celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes Orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a mix of purple, white, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows in dense, humid tropical forests, often in shaded environments with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its floral structure includes a complex arrangement of sepals and petals, with a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Orchiodes celebicum is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
