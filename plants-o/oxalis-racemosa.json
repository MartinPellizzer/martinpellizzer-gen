    "intro": "Oxalis racemosa, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage resembles that of true sorrel, though it is not related to the genus Rumex. Oxalis racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
