    "intro": "Orobanche rapum-genistae subsp. benthamii, commonly known as the yellow broom broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system. It typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as Vicia species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
