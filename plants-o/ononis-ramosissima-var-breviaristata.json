    "intro": "Ononis ramosissima var. breviaristata, commonly known as the short-branched sand oat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features wiry, branching stems that are typically covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor, sandy soils."
