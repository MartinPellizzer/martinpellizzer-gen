    "intro": "Ornithidium rauhii, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland regions. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
