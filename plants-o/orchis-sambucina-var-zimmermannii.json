    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. zimmermannii, commonly known as the Zimmermann's orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a complex root system and relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
