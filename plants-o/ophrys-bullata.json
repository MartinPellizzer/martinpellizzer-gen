    "intro": "Ophrys bullata, commonly known as the bull orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with a single, showy flower that resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces a single, erect stem that can reach up to 40 cm in height. Ophrys bullata is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the flower mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male pollinators."
