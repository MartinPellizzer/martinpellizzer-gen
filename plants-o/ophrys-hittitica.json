    "intro": "Ophrys hittitica, commonly known as the Hittite bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys hittitica is considered a rare and endangered species."
