    "intro": "Orchis cordigera var. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Balkan region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
