It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a tall, erect stem with several leaves and produces a cluster of violet or purple flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
