    "intro": "Orthosia kunthii, commonly known as the desert broom, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Orthosia kunthii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
