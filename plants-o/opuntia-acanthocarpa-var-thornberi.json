    "intro": "Opuntia acanthocarpa var. thornberi, commonly known as the Thornberg's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
