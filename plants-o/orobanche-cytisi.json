    "intro": "Orobanche cytisi, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, typically members of the Fabaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
