It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The leaves are small, elongated, and often have a distinct midrib, contributing to its intricate appearance. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its delicate structure makes it a notable species in ecological studies of bryophyte communities."
