    "intro": "Ophelia ciliata, commonly known as the water clover, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Ophelia ciliata thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
