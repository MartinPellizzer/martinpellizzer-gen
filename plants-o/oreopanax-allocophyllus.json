    "intro": "Oreopanax allocophyllus, commonly known as the Andean arrow leaf, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
