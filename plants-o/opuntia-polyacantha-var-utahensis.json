    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for food and medicine."
