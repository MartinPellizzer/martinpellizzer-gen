    "intro": "Oncidium marinii, commonly known as the Marine Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in well-draining potting media. Oncidium marinii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
