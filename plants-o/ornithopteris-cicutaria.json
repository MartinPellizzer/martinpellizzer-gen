    "intro": "Ornithopteris cicutaria, commonly known as the common water fern, is a aquatic fern species native to temperate regions. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality in its native ecosystems."
