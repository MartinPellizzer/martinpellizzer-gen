It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxyrhachis gracillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
