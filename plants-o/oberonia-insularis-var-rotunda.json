It is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in montane forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
