The plant produces a single, showy flower with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys eretriae typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its botanical features include a pseudobulb, fleshy roots, and a unique floral structure that enhances its ecological interactions."
