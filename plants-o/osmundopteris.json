    "intro": "Osmundopteris, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Osmundaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. They possess a unique structure with a central stalk and a network of roots that anchor them in shallow water. Osmundopteris species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Their reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
