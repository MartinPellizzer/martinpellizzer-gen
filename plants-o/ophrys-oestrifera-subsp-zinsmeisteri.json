    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. zinsmeisteri, commonly known as the Zinsmeister's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
