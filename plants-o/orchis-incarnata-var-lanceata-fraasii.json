    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. lanceata-fraasii, commonly known as the lance-leaf fairy orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive lance-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. This variant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant has a short, horizontal rhizome and produces a single, erect flowering stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
