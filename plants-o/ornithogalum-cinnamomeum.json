It features strap-like, pale green to yellowish leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive cinnamon-like scent, which is reflected in its common name. It blooms during the summer months and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
