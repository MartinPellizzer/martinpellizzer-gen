    "intro": "Orobanche aegyptiaca subsp. tunetana, commonly known as the Egyptian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, often white or pale yellow flowers, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species. It is native to North Africa and the Middle East, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
