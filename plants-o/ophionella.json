These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in shades of green or white. Ophionella species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
