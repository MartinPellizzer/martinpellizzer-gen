    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 tumentia subsp. sancti-martinii, commonly known as the Saint-Martin's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations."
