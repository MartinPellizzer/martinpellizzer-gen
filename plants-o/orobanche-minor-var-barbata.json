    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. barbata, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and reduced leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots. Its life cycle involves forming specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients from the host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
