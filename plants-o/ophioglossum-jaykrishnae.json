    "intro": "Ophioglossum jaykrishnae, commonly known as the Jaykrishna's adder's tongue, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporangium. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with a short, thick rhizome and a single, elongated leaf that is often divided into two parts. It thrives in moist, shaded forest floors and is adapted to humid tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
