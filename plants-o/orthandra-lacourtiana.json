    "intro": "Orthandra lacourtiana, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that resemble small stars, typically blooming during the dry season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish sepals that contrast with its vibrant floral display. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
