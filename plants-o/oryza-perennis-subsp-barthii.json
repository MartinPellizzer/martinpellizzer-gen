    "intro": "Oryza perennis subsp. barthii, commonly known as the African ricegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that contain minute grains, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, tropical and subtropical environments, often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and ecological resilience."
