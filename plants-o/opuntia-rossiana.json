    "intro": "Opuntia rossiana, commonly known as the Ross's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia rossiana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
