    "intro": "Obione subtilis, commonly known as the delicate orchid, is a rare and understudied species belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Its root system is highly specialized, forming symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obione subtilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
