    "intro": "Oeceoclades zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Zanzibar in Tanzania. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
