    "intro": "Orthocarpus copelandii, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and rimu, using a specialized root system called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers and is pollinated by native bees and other insects. Its berries, which are toxic to humans, are an important food source for certain bird species. Orthocarpus copelandii plays a unique role in the ecological dynamics of New Zealand's forests."
