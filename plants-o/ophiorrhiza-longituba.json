    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandalwood, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with white or pale yellow petals, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Ophiorrhiza longituba is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited traditional uses in local herbal medicine."
