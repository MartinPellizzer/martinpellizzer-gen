    "intro": "Onobrychis mareotica, commonly known as the Mareotica burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are encased in hairy, pod-like structures that aid in dispersal. Onobrychis mareotica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
