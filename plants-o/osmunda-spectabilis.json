    "intro": "Osmunda spectabilis, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, elegant fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive fiddlehead shape in early spring. The plant has a unique life cycle, with separate sporangia-bearing and fertile fronds on the same plant. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Osmunda spectabilis is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade."
