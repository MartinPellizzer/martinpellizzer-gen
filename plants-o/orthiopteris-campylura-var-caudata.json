    "intro": "Orthiopteris campylura var. caudata, commonly known as the curly-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Orthiopteris. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant is valued in water gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to help clarify water by absorbing nutrients."
