    "intro": "Ophrys hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a distinctive yellow and brown pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by bees, which are deceived into thinking they are mating with a female bee. Ophrys hygrophila is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
