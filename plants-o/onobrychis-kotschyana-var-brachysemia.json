    "intro": "Onobrychis kotschyana var. brachysemia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with narrow, leathery blades. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are followed by cylindrical, spiny pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This species is valued for its forage quality and ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
