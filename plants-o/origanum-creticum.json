It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Origanum creticum is often used in culinary applications and traditional herbal remedies."
