    "intro": "Odontochilus sandvicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Hawaii. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a slender stem and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a distinctive tooth-like structure on the lip, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in the shaded, moist environments of Hawaiian rainforests, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts."
