    "intro": "Orthiopteris domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Orthiopteris domingensis plays a role in water filtration and supports local biodiversity."
