    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pantaliciensis, commonly known as the Pantalicci orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the island of Pantallicia in the Mediterranean. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces showy, bee-mimicking flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
