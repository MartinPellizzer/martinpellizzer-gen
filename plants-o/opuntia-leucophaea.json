    "intro": "Opuntia leucophaea, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia leucophaea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
