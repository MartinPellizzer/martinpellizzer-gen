It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its typical legume flowers and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its small, white to pale pink flowers appear in clusters, and it has a low-growing, mat-forming habit. The variety nyirsegensis is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slight morphological differences from the typical form."
