    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 decipiens, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its strikingly similar appearance to the bee orchid, Orchis morio, which leads to its common name. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a bee, aiding in pollination. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands. Orchis \u00d7 decipiens is a short-lived perennial, typically blooming in late spring to early summer."
