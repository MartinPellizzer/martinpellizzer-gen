    "intro": "Oenothera obtusifolia, commonly known as bluntleaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Oenothera obtusifolia is a member of the Onagraceae family, which includes other evening primroses and related species. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
