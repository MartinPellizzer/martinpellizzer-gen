    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris var. kintyrica, commonly known as yellow bur pea, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, spiked pods. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
