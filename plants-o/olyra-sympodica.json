    "intro": "Olyra sympodica, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by triangular, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Olyra sympodica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some African cultures."
