    "intro": "Oleandra gracilis, commonly known as the slender oleander, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers. The plant is evergreen, with a dense, compact growth habit that makes it suitable for ornamental landscaping. Oleandra gracilis is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
