    "intro": "Ophrys schulzei subsp. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific regions of the Middle East. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in temperate and semi-arid climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
