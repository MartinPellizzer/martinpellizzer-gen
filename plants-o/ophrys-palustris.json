    "intro": "Ophrys palustris, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female wasps, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The orchid produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer."
