    "intro": "Oxytropis semiglobosa, commonly known as the globular milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its globular, spiny seed pods that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh conditions. Oxytropis semiglobosa is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
