It features fleshy, grey-green leaves that are broad and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
