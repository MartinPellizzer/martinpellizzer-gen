    "intro": "Oldenlandia juncoides, commonly known as the slender bluet, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its small, blue or violet flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, contributing to its resemblance to sedges."
