    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-beaked male orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique morphology, with long, narrow leaves and a distinctive, spurred lip on its flowers. It is a terrestrial orchid that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its ecological specificity. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered in many areas."
