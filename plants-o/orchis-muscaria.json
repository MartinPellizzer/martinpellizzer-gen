    "intro": "Orchis muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric, is a striking member of the orchid family with a distinctive appearance. It features a large, umbrella-shaped cap that is typically bright red with white spots, and a short, slender stem. The plant is mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi in the soil, which is essential for its growth. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or green, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn. This mushroom-like orchid is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodlands and meadows."
