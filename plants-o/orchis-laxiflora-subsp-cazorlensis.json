    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora subsp. cazorlensis, commonly known as the Cazorla orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Iberian Peninsula. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated by various insect species, including bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
