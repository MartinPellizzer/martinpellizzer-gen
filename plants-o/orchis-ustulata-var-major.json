    "intro": "Orchis ustulata var. major, commonly known as the greater marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist habitat. The greater marsh orchid is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
