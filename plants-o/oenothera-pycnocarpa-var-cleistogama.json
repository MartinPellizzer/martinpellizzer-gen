    "intro": "Oenothera pycnocarpa var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose characterized by its closed, self-fertilizing flowers. It is native to North America and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas or along roadsides. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. This variant is notable for its unique reproductive strategy, which enhances its survival in harsh environments."
