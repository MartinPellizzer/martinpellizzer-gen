    "intro": "Osmunda zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon royal fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinct rhizome system that allows it to spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, typical of ferns. Osmunda zeylanica is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors where it thrives in high humidity and moderate temperatures."
