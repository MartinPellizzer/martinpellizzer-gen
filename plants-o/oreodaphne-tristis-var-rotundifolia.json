It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Oreodaphne genus."
