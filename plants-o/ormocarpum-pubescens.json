    "intro": "Ormocarpum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ormocarp, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its fruit, known as a schizocarp, splits into two one-seeded parts when mature, a feature common in the Apiaceae family. Ormocarpum pubescens is adapted to withstand arid conditions, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss."
