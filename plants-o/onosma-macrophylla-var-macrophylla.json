    "intro": "Onosma macrophylla var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved onosma, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in dense spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
