    "intro": "Osmorhiza nuda var. divaricata, commonly known as the slender cowwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps."
