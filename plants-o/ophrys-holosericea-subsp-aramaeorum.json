    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. aramaeorum, commonly known as the Aroma Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex, insect-mimicking flower that resembles a female bee, which aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
