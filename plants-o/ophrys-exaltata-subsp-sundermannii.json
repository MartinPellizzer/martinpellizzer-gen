    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. sundermannii, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing a single or few showy flowers per stem."
