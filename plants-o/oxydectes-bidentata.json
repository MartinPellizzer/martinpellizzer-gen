    "intro": "Oxydectes bidentata, commonly known as the two-toothed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with two distinct teeth at the tip, giving it its common name. The bright yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by parachute-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
