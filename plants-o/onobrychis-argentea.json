    "intro": "Onobrychis argentea, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Silver vetch is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial in soil enrichment."
