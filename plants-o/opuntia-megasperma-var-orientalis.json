    "intro": "Opuntia megasperma var. orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. It is a drought-tolerant plant, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its succulent stems store water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions."
