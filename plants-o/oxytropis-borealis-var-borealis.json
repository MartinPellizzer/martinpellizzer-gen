It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Oxytropis borealis var. borealis is often found in tundra and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
