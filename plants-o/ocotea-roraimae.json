    "intro": "Ocotea roraimae, commonly known as Roraima ocotea, is a small evergreen tree native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is typically found in humid, shaded environments at high elevations. Its wood is valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is not widely commercially exploited. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
