    "intro": "Opuntia fragilis var. brachyarthra, commonly known as the short-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other Opuntia species. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red or purple fruits that are edible. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
