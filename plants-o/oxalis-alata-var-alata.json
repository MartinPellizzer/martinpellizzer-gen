    "intro": "Oxalis alata var. alata, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of clover, and its clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
