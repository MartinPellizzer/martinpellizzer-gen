    "intro": "Oberonia masarangica, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and often have a distinctive coloration, ranging from greenish-white to pale yellow. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia masarangica is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
