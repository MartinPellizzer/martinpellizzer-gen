    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora f. sedi, commonly known as the narrow-flowered broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its reduced, often clustered inflorescence and small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often in Mediterranean climates. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
