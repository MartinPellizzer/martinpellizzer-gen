    "intro": "Oreophilus irrasus, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its delicate, silver-hued leaves that reflect sunlight, aiding in its survival in cooler, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pale blue with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Oreophilus irrasus is considered a rare and endangered species."
