    "intro": "Onobrychis vulgaris var. montana, commonly known as mountain sweet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
