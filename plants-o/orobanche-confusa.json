    "intro": "Orobanche confusa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a taproot system that connects to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on grasses, legumes, and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
