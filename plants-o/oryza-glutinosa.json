    "intro": "Oryza glutinosa, commonly known as sticky rice or glutinous rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, compact grains that adhere to each other when cooked, giving it a sticky texture. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with long, narrow leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. Its seeds are rich in starch and are widely used in culinary traditions across Asia. The botanical features of Oryza glutinosa make it well-suited for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates."
