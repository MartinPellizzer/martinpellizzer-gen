    "intro": "Opuntia arborescens var. versicolor, commonly known as the rainbow prickly pear, is a variant of the opuntia plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its colorful, flattened stems that display a range of hues, including pink, red, and purple, which intensify with age. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a succulent structure adapted to arid environments. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
