    "intro": "Ornithogalum trachyphyllum, commonly known as the rough-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, underground rhizome and produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant blooms with umbels of white or pale green star-shaped flowers, typically in spring. Its leaves are characterized by their rough, hairy texture, which gives it its specific epithet \"trachyphyllum.\" It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and the United States."
