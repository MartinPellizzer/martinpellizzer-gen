    "intro": "Oplismenus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant contains oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities."
