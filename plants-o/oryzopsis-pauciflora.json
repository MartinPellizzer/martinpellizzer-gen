    "intro": "Oryzopsis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered milletgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with few flowers, giving it its common name. Its seed heads are usually pale green to golden in color and are adapted for wind dispersal. Oryzopsis pauciflora is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
