    "intro": "Opuntia urbaniana, commonly known as the urban cactus, is a species of prickly pear cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia urbaniana is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
