    "intro": "Oncostylus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered oncystylus, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds. Oncostylus uniflorus is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native habitat."
