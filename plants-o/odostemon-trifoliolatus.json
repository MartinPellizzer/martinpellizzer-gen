It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically along a central stem. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
