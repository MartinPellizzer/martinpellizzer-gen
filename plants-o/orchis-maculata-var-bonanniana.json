    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. bonanniana, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with showy, violet-blue to purple flowers. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of flowers, often with a distinct dark purple or brownish blotch on the lower lip of each flower. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Orchis maculata."
