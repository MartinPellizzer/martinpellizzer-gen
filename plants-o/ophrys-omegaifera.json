    "intro": "Ophrys omegaifera, commonly known as the Omega Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically greenish-yellow with dark markings, resembling a wasp's body. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is adapted to specific ecological conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
