    "intro": "Ophrys transhyrcana subsp. morio, commonly known as the Transcaucasian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, which is a key adaptation for its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
