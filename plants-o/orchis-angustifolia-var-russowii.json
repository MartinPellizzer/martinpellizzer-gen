    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. russowii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem that bears a spike of pale purple to white flowers. This variety is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows. The flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dark brown capsules as its fruit. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
