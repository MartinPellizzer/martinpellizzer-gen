    "intro": "Orchis okellyi, commonly known as the Okelly's orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the orchid family found primarily in specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers have a complex structure with three sepals and three petals, with the latter often modified into showy lip petals. Orchis okellyi is notable for its ecological significance and is often protected due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss."
