    "intro": "Ononis inaequalifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Ononis inaequalifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in arid environments."
