    "intro": "Orchis sambucina f. obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant features lanceolate to obovate leaves, which are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
