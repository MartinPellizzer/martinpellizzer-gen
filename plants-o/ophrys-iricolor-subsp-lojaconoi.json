    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor subsp. lojaconoi, commonly known as the Lojaconoi bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, and it thrives in calcareous soils. It is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
