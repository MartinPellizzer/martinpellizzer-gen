    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. cornutula, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinct horn-shaped projection on the lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in several European countries."
