    "intro": "Oldenlandia echinulosa, commonly known as the spiked mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on host plants for water and nutrients while also performing photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds, which can adhere to the bark of host trees."
