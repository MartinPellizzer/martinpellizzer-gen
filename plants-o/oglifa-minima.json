    "intro": "Oglifa minima, commonly known as the dwarf glima fern, is a small, delicate plant native to the moist, shaded understories of temperate forests. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to their size and coloration. Oglifa minima thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soil and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
