    "intro": "Orostachys paradoxa, commonly known as the paradox grass or ghost plant, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, pale flowers that are typically inconspicuous and short-lived. It is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
