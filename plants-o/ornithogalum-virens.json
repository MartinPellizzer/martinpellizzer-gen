It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of bell-shaped, greenish-white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated by insects. Ornithogalum virens is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and has mild toxic properties in its leaves and seeds."
