It is characterized by its climbing habit, with long, flexible stems that allow it to ascend trees and other structures. The plant features large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in inflorescences, and it produces berries that are an important food source for various wildlife.
