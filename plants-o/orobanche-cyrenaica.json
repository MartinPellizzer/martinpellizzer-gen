    "intro": "Orobanche cyrenaica, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with most of its structure consisting of a stem and flowers. It is often found parasitizing species of the genus Chenopodium and other dicot plants. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique ecological role in its habitat."
