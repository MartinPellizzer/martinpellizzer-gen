    "intro": "Oporanthus exiguus, commonly known as the slender oporanthus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
