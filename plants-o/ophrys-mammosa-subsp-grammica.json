    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. grammica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinct, hairy lip that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in rocky, limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
