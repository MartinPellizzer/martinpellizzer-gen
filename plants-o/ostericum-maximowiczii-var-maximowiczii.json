    "intro": "Ostericum maximowiczii var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian stonecress, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It features basal leaves that are lobed and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in cold climates."
