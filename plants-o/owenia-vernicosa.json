    "intro": "Owenia vernicosa, commonly known as the silky oak, is a tropical rainforest tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Owenia vernicosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat for various native wildlife species. Its growth is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in dense forest environments."
