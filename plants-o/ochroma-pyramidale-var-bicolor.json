    "intro": "Ochroma pyramidale var. bicolor, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which gives it its common name. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in parks and urban landscapes."
