    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lucianiorum, commonly known as the greater sheep's beard, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a prominent, fuzzy lip resembling a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Ophrys \u00d7 lucianiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
