    "intro": "Ouratea jaliscensis, commonly known as the Mexican ouratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Mexico, particularly in the state of Jalisco. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
