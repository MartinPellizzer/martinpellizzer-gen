    "intro": "Ononis antiquorum var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy stems that often turn reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
