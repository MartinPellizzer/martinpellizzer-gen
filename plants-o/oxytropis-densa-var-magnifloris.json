    "intro": "Oxytropis densa var. magnifloris, commonly known as the dense locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open plains, grasslands, and rocky areas. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
