    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. assamica, commonly known as Assam rice, is a variety of rice native to the northeastern region of India, particularly Assam. It is characterized by its short, plump grains and high amylose content, which contributes to its firm texture when cooked. This variety is well adapted to the humid and tropical climate of the region, thriving in alluvial soils with abundant water supply. It is primarily cultivated for its aromatic and nutty flavor, making it a popular choice in local cuisines. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it is also of interest in rice breeding programs aimed at improving yield and resistance to diseases."
