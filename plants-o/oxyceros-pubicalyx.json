    "intro": "Oxyceros pubicalyx, commonly known as the hairy-leafed oxyceros, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release seeds, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Oxyceros pubicalyx is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
