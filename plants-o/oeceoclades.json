    "intro": "Oeceoclades, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Oeceoclades thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees. Due to its delicate nature and habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
