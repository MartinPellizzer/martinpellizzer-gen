    "intro": "Orthochilus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered orthochilus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Orthochilus parviflorus is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
