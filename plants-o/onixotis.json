    "intro": "Onixotis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, white, orchid-like flowers and its ability to thrive in specific, often difficult-to-reach habitats. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a delicate root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Onixotis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
