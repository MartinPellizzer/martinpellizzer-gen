    "intro": "Onosma arenaria subsp. fallax, commonly known as the desert sandthrift, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
