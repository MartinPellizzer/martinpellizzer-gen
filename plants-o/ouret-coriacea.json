    "intro": "Ouret coriacea, commonly known as the rough ouret, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a rough, textured coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a resilient species in arid environments. Ouret coriacea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
