It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height. The plant produces a single, showy violet-blue flower with a distinctive hooded labellum, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. It typically grows in calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or on rocky slopes.
