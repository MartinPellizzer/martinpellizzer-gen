    "intro": "Onoclea discolor, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water's surface, with small, oval leaves. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Onoclea discolor thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches."
