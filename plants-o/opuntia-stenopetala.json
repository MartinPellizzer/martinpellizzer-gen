    "intro": "Opuntia stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. Opuntia stenopetala is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in local cultures."
