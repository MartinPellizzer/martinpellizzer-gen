    "intro": "Oxygraphis delavayi var. nyingchiensis, commonly known as the Nyingchi oxygraphis, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its cold and arid habitat, with compact growth and specialized root systems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
