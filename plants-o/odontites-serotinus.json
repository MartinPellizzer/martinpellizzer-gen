    "intro": "Odontites serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering toothwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically from July to September. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Odontites serotinus is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
