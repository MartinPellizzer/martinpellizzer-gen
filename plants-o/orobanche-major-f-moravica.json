    "intro": "Orobanche major f. moravica, commonly known as the Moravian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various herbaceous species. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that are often arranged in clusters. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of specific host plants, which vary depending on the geographic region. This subspecies is native to Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in disturbed or open habitats."
