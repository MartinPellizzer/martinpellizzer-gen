    "intro": "Opuntia elatior, commonly known as the broadleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains small, sweet seeds. Opuntia elatior is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
