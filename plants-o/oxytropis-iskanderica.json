    "intro": "Oxytropis iskanderica, commonly known as Iskander's locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and often grows in rocky or sandy soils. It produces pods that contain seeds with a hard coat, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Oxytropis iskanderica is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
