    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 gennarii nothosubsp. istriaca, commonly known as the Istrian hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis gennarii. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear numerous showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in woodland and grassland habitats across the Balkans. It has lanceolate, hairy leaves that are arranged along the stem. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological adaptations."
