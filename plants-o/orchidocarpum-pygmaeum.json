    "intro": "Orchidocarpum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf orchidocarpum, is a rare and diminutive plant belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit, typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant exhibits a unique combination of orchid-like features and distinct morphological traits that set it apart from other orchid species. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Orchidocarpum pygmaeum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
