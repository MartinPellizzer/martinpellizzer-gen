    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves with a narrow margin. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
