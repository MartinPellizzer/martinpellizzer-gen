    "intro": "Orchis longicornu f. pallida, commonly known as the pale orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing a cluster of pale pink to white flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and have a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. This plant prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is a protected species in several European countries due to its declining population and ecological significance."
