    "intro": "Orobanche psilostemon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant has a short, thick stem with a single flower cluster at the top. It is often associated with leguminous hosts such as vetch and clover. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
