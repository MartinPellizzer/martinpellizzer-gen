    "intro": "Ophrys sancti-isidorii, commonly known as the Isidore's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that closely resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
