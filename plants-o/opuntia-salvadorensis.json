It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its fruit, called a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia salvadorensis is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
