    "intro": "Oxalis squamosoradicosa var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf wood sorrel, is a species native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves and flowers are edible, though the plant contains oxalic acid, so it should be consumed in moderation."
