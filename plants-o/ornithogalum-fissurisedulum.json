It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are white or pale yellow, often with a greenish tinge. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
