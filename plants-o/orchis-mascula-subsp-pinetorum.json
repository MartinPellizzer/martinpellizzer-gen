It typically grows in moist, acidic soils within pine forests and other woodlands. The plant features a single, erect stem that can reach up to 30 cm in height, bearing a single, showy, violet-blue flower. Its roots are adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, and it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
