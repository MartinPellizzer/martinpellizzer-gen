    "intro": "Orchis anatolica var. kochii, commonly known as the Anatolian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Turkey and the Balkans. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, often with a yellow or green lip. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral morphology and limited geographic distribution."
