    "intro": "Oreonesion, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils with minimal water. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Oreonesion plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
