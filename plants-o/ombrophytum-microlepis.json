    "intro": "Ombrophytum microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved forest fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and understoreys, where it thrives in low light conditions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed, contributing to its dense foliage. Its reproductive structures include small, sporangia-bearing leaves that produce spores for propagation. Ombrophytum microlepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
