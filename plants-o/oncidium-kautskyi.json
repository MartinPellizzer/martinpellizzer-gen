    "intro": "Oncidium kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow and green hues. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in environments with seasonal droughts. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium kautskyi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
