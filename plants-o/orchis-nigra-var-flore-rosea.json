    "intro": "Orchis nigra var. flore-rosea, commonly known as the rose-lilac orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in moist, shaded woodlands. The plant features tall, slender stems with large, hooded flowers that range in color from deep purple to rose-lilac. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects. The orchid relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, highlighting its complex ecological relationships."
