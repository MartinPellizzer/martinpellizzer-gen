    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora subsp. ensifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features lanceolate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, arranged in a loose spike, and are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
