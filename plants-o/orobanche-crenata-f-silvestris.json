    "intro": "Orobanche crenata f. silvestris, commonly known as the wild common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various parts of Europe, including the British Isles. The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including legumes and grasses, and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist feeder."
