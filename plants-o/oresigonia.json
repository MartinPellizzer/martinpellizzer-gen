    "intro": "Oresigonia, commonly known as the goldenrod, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, yellow or golden inflorescences, which are composed of numerous small flowers arranged in a head. Oresigonia species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. They have lance-shaped leaves and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. The genus is native to North America and plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
