    "intro": "Oenanthe crocata var. tenuisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often near streams or in damp woodlands. The plant features slender, branching stems that are usually covered with small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in dense umbels, and it produces tiny, dark brown seeds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Oenanthe crocata."
