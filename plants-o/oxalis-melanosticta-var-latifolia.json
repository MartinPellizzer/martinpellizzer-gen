    "intro": "Oxalis melanosticta var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped lobes and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves and flowers are often covered in fine hairs, and it has a rhizomatous root system that aids in its spread. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
