    "intro": "Oreoschimperella, commonly known as the \"skeleton leaf,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often palmate leaves that resemble skeletal structures, giving it its common name. The plants typically have showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oreoschimperella species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas."
