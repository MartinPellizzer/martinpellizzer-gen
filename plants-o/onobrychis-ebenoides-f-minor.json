    "intro": "Onobrychis ebenoides f. minor, commonly known as the lesser false vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
