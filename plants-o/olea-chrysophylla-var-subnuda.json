    "intro": "Olea chrysophylla var. subnuda, commonly known as the silky olive, is a rare and unique variant of the olive tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-covered leaves that give it a soft, silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in coastal areas with well-drained soils and mild, humid climates. Its small, fragrant flowers are followed by edible fruits that are similar to those of the common olive. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
