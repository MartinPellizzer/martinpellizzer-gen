    "intro": "Orchis lancibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bracted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The orchid's pollination is often facilitated by bees and other insects attracted to its fragrant blooms."
