    "intro": "Orthosiphon dissitifolius, commonly known as the hairy leathery plant, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its aromatic properties, it is often used in traditional medicine for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
