    "intro": "Oreophylax saxosus, commonly known as the saxicola orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually greenish-white or pale yellow in color. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates it inhabits. Due to its specialized habitat, Oreophylax saxosus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
