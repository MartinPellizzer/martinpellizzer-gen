    "intro": "Oncidium haematoxanthum, commonly known as the red-tipped orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, showy flowers with red-tipped petals and a yellow center, often blooming in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
