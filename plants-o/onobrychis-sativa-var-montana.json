    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa var. montana, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing habit, with trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its fibrous root system and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant in harsh climates."
