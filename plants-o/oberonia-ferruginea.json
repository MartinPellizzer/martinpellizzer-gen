    "intro": "Oberonia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on the forest floor or along stream banks. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with numerous small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and the flowers have a distinctive reddish-brown hue, giving it its common name. Oberonia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
