It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by olive-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and has a moderate growth rate. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
