    "intro": "Oenanthe millefolia, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its flowers give way to small, dry fruits that contain aromatic seeds. Oenanthe millefolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
