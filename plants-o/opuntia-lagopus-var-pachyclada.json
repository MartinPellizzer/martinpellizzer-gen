    "intro": "Opuntia lagopus var. pachyclada, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flattened, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, spherical fruits known as tunas. Its thick, waxy cuticle helps it retain water in arid environments, and its spines provide protection from herbivores. The varietal name *pachyclada* refers to its thick, fleshy stems, which are adapted for storing moisture."
