    "intro": "Ophioglossum capense var. nudicaule, commonly known as the naked-stem ophioglossum, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its short, creeping rhizome and a single, erect, lance-shaped leaf that is often deeply divided. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sporangiophores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
