    "intro": "Orchis arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spider-like appearance due to its long, slender flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Orchis arachnites is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
