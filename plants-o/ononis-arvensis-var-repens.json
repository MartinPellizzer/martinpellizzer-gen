It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features slender, prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes. The plant has small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom from May to July, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is commonly found in dry, open habitats. The species is known for its ability to colonize areas quickly, making it a characteristic weed in agricultural settings."
