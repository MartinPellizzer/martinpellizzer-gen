    "intro": "Oncocyclus susianus, commonly known as the Susian sunflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to Turkey. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange ray flowers surrounding a central disk of dark brown tubular florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oncocyclus susianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, sun-like appearance."
