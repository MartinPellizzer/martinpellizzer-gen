It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its extensive root system, which helps prevent soil erosion. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in forage and land reclamation. Its nitrogen-fixing ability makes it valuable in agricultural settings."
