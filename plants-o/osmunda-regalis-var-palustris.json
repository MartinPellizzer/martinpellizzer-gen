    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a variant of the royal fern that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its tall, erect fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive fiddlehead shape in the spring. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. This fern is an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
