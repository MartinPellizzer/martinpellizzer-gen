    "intro": "Opuntia longiclada, commonly known as the long-clawed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed hairs that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia longiclada is a drought-tolerant species adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
