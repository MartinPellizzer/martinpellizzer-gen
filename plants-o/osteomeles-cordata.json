    "intro": "Osteomeles cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf osteomele, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically opposite on the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Osteomeles cordata is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
