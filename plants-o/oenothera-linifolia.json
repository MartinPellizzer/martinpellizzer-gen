    "intro": "Oenothera linifolia, commonly known as silky evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by capsule fruits that release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Oenothera linifolia is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
