    "intro": "Ononis cephalantha, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or arctic regions. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ononis cephalantha is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
