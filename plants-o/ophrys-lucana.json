    "intro": "Ophrys lucana, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils in grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys lucana is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, showy bloom per stem."
