    "intro": "Ostericum praeteritum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically light green, with a subtle, almost translucent appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its spores are released in small quantities, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Ostericum praeteritum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
