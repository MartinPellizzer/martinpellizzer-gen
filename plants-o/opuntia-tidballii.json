    "intro": "Opuntia tidballii, commonly known as the Tidball's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Australia. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, typically in spring, followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Opuntia tidballii thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and high temperatures. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
