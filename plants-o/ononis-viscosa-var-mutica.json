    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. mutica, commonly known as hairy everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. This species is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in ecological restoration projects."
