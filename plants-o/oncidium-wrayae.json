    "intro": "Oncidium wrayae, commonly known as the Wray's orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with red or brown markings. Oncidium wrayae thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its flowers bloom in clusters and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
