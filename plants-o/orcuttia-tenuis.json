    "intro": "Orcuttia tenuis, commonly known as the slender Orcuttia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Orcuttia tenuis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
