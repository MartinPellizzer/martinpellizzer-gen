    "intro": "Onoclea sensibilis f. acutisegmenta, commonly known as the acute-segmented water clover, is a variant of the common water clover. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant features finely divided, acutely serrated leaflets that give it a distinct appearance. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for water quality and its ecological contribution to aquatic ecosystems."
