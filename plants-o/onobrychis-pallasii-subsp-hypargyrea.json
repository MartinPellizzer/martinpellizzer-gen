    "intro": "Onobrychis pallasii subsp. hypargyrea, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Silver vetch is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
