    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 jaccardii, commonly known as the Jaccard's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a terrestrial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies due to its nectar-rich flowers."
