    "intro": "Oxytropis coerulea subsp. monticola, commonly known as blue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, blue to purple pea-like flowers. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
