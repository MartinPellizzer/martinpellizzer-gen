    "intro": "Onobrychis pulvillus, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The seeds are encased in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals."
