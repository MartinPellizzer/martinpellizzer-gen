    "intro": "Odontoglossum cruentum, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, vivid red or purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are dark green and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to retain moisture. Odontoglossum cruentum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in its native habitat."
