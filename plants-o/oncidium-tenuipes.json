    "intro": "Oncidium tenuipes, commonly known as the slender leaved orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and thrives in well-draining soil. Oncidium tenuipes is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and long-lasting blooms."
