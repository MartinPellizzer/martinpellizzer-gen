    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza curtiflora, commonly known as the narrow-flowered mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza curtiflora plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
