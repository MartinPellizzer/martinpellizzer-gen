    "intro": "Ornithidium coccineum, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking red stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or red in color, arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
