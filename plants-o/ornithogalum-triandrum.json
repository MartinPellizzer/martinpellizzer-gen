    "intro": "Ornithogalum triandrum, commonly known as the three-lobed star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which stores nutrients and water. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
