It features small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has a creeping habit with slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It is often used in erosion control due to its dense growth and adaptability to various soil types."
