    "intro": "Opuntia sulphurea subsp. vulpina, commonly known as the golden prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are typically bright yellow to orange in color. The plant produces large, showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its pads are covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. Opuntia sulphurea subsp. vulpina is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick, fleshy stems."
