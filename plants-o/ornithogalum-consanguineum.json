    "intro": "Ornithogalum consanguineum, commonly known as the red-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces umbels of striking, white or pinkish-white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has lanceolate, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Ornithogalum consanguineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
