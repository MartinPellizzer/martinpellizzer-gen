    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea var. sterilis, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a variant of the cinnamon fern that lacks fertile fronds. It is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pale green to brown, sterile fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
