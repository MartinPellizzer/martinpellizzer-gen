    "intro": "Oryzopsis microcarpa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy dwarf bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its short,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and ability to provide texture in drought-tolerant gardens."
