    "intro": "Odontychium, commonly known as the silverleaf lichen, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic algal partner. The plant exhibits a crust-like growth form, typically forming a thin, white or grayish layer on rocks or tree bark. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Odontychium is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
