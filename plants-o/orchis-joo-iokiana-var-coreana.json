It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include tuberous roots and lanceolate leaves, which aid in water retention. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
