    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. longibracteatoides, commonly known as the long-bract male orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy, violet-blue flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, and it produces a single, erect stem bearing the floral display. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for undisturbed forest ecosystems."
