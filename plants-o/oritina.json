    "intro": "Oritina, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Oritina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its vibrant blooms and ease of care."
