    "intro": "Orobanche rapum proles benthamii, commonly known as the root broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a single, fleshy, club-shaped structure. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is often found parasitizing members of the Brassicaceae family, such as mustard and cabbage plants. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
