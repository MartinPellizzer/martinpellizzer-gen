    "intro": "Orobanche monoclonos, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and wild plants."
