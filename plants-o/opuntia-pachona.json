    "intro": "Opuntia pachona, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pachona is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is also valued for its ornamental and culinary uses."
