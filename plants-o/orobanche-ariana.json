    "intro": "Orobanche ariana, commonly known as the Armenian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellow to reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in association with various leguminous hosts. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
