It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, segmented leaves that often have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a broad, arrowhead-shaped base. Oreopanax sectifolius is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
