    "intro": "Oxytropis subpodoloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss. Oxytropis subpodoloba plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
