    "intro": "Oxytropis strobilacea var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its presence is often indicative of disturbed or dry, open habitats."
