It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in wetland or swampy environments, often forming dense stands in shallow water. Ochlandra ebracteata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
