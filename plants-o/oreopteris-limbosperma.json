    "intro": "Oreopteris limbosperma, commonly known as the western wood fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes, where it can anchor itself to soil or rock surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Oreopteris limbosperma plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
