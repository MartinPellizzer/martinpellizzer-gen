    "intro": "Ophrys aeoli, commonly known as the Aeolian orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Aeolian Islands. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like appearance, with a flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Ophrys aeoli is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
