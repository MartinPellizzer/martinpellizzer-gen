    "intro": "Orontium aquaticum, commonly known as water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy and water retention. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in a spike, and it produces distinctive, club-shaped fruits. Water shield plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
