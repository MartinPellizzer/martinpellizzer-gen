    "intro": "Oenanthe smithii, commonly known as Smith's water dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of North America. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, hollow stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in umbels. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Oenanthe smithii is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
