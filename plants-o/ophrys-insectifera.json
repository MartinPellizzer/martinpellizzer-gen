    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow with dark markings and a distinctive \"face\" that resembles a bee's head. Ophrys insectifera is a perennial herb that grows to a height of about 20\u201340 centimeters, producing a single spike of flowers during the spring and early summer."
