    "intro": "Ornithocephalus lehmannii, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features showy, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a creeping stem system with fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its flowers are typically clustered in terminal racemes, and it produces small, dry fruits known as capsules. Ornithocephalus lehmannii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
