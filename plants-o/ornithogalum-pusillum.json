    "intro": "Ornithogalum pusillum, commonly known as the lesser star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, elongated berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Ornithogalum pusillum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to bloom in late spring to early summer."
