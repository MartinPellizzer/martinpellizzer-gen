    "intro": "Opuntia camachoi, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads called cladodes, which are often used in traditional cuisine. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia camachoi is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in dry climates."
