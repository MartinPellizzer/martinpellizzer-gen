It features a short, thick rhizome and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ornithogalum plurifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
