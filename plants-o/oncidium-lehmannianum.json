    "intro": "Oncidium lehmannianum, commonly known as the lemon-scented orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which are often fragrant and resemble a cluster of lemons. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium lehmannianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
