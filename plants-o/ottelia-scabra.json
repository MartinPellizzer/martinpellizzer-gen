    "intro": "Ottelia scabra, commonly known as the rough water plant, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions. Ottelia scabra is also noted for its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
