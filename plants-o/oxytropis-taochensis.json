    "intro": "Oxytropis taochensis, commonly known as the Taouchan locoweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and is often avoided by livestock."
