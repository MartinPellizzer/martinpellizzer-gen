    "intro": "Ophioglossum moluccanum, commonly known as the Moluccan adder's mouth, is a unique fern-like plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically green and leaf-like. The plant produces small, yellowish sporangia on the underside of the sporophylls, which release spores for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
