    "intro": "Oreogrammitis montana, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern found in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in mountainous areas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis montana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
