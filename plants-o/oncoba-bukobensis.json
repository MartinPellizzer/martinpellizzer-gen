It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits. Oncoba bukobensis thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
