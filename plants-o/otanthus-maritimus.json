    "intro": "Otanthus maritimus, commonly known as the sea daffodil, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to saline and arid environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune systems along the coastline. Its growth is typically low to the ground, with a rosette formation that helps conserve moisture. Otanthus maritimus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
