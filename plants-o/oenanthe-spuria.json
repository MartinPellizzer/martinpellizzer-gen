    "intro": "Oenanthe spuria, commonly known as the common water hemlock, is a toxic plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial herb that typically grows in wet or disturbed soils, often near waterways. The plant has a slender, hollow stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Despite its beauty, it is highly poisonous, containing toxic compounds such as cicutoxin, which can be fatal to humans and animals if ingested."
