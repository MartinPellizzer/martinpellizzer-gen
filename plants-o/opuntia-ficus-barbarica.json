    "intro": "Opuntia ficus-barbarica, commonly known as the Barbary fig or goat's tongue cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are often ribbed and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits resembling small figs. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia ficus-barbarica is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source for both humans and animals."
