    "intro": "Orobanche reticulata subsp. agigensis, commonly known as the Ethiopian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to the highlands of Ethiopia and grows in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
