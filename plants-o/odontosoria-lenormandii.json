    "intro": "Odontosoria lenormandii, commonly known as the Lenormand's tooth fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like lobes on the fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are often arching or creeping. Odontosoria lenormandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
