    "intro": "Ornithogalum scabrocostatum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
