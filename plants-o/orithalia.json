It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like blooms. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.

It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
