    "intro": "Orchis resupinata, commonly known as the nodding orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, downward-facing flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are borne in a spike that often curves downward. Orchis resupinata thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
