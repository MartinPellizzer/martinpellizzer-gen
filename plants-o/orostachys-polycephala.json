    "intro": "Orostachys polycephala, commonly known as the stonecress or the desert stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed capsules. Orostachys polycephala is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
