    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. sauteri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and is the subject of conservation efforts."
