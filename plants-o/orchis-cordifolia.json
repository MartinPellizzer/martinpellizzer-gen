    "intro": "Orchis cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and tall, erect stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It is a perennial herb that blooms from June to August. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native range."
