    "intro": "Oxalis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves covered in a dense, woolly white pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with five petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis tomentosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
