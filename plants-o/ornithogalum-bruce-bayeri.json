    "intro": "Ornithogalum bruce-bayeri, commonly known as the Bruce-Bayer's star-of-Bethlehem, is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a bulbous perennial plant that produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
