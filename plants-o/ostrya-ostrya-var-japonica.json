    "intro": "Ostrya ostrya var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, edible nuts enclosed in a cupule, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance that distinguishes it from other members of its genus."
