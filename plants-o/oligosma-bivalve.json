    "intro": "Oligosma bivalve, commonly known as the two-valve oligosma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. Due to habitat loss, Oligosma bivalve is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant conservation."
