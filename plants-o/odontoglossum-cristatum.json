    "intro": "Odontoglossum cristatum, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, crested appearance on the upper lip of its flowers, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves. It produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a contrasting lip. Odontoglossum cristatum prefers cool, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
