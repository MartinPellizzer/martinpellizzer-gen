    "intro": "Oxytropis baxoiensis, commonly known as the Baxoi locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is often found in steppes and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
