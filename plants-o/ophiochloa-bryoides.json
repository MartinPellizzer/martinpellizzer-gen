    "intro": "Ophiochloa bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like grass, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy layer, aiding in water retention. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, typical of many grass species. Ophiochloa bryoides is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall due to its drought-resistant adaptations."
