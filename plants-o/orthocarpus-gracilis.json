    "intro": "Orthocarpus gracilis, commonly known as the slender orthocarpus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. Its fruit is a slender, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, a characteristic feature of the genus Orthocarpus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and early spring blooms."
