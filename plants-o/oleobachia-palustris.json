    "intro": "Oleobachia palustris, commonly known as the swamp oleaster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Oleobachia palustris has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil in its wetland environment. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which aids in reducing water loss in its humid habitat."
