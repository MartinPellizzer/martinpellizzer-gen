    "intro": "Opuntia aquosa, commonly known as the water prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia aquosa is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Its succulent stems store water, making it a resilient plant in desert conditions."
