    "intro": "Onobrychis petraea f. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny rock bur, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and spiny pods that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, rocky soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
