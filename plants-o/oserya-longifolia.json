    "intro": "Oserya longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf oserya, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Oserya longifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
