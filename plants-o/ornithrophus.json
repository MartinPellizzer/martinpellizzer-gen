    "intro": "Ornithrophus, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble a bird's foot, and its clusters of yellow or orange flowers. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Ornithrophus is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It is also a valuable source of nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
