    "intro": "Orthopogon compositus, commonly known as the composite grass or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite inflorescence. Orthopogon compositus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
