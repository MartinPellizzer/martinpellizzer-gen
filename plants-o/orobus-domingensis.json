    "intro": "Orobus domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments within forest understories. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, with a distinctive, spurred shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
