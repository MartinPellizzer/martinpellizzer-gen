    "intro": "Ononis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, blue or purple flowers and its ability to thrive in saline and sandy soils. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, which helps it stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Ononis maritima is well adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats."
