    "intro": "Odontites breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, tooth-like leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations. Due to its habitat specificity, Odontites breviflorus is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystems."
