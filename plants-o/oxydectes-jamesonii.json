    "intro": "Oxydectes jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's oxydectes, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting blue or purple veins. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxydectes jamesonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
