    "intro": "Ophrys aestiva, commonly known as the Early Bee Orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's petal. Ophrys aestiva thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and heathlands."
