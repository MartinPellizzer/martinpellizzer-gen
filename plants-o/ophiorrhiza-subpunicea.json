    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza subpunicea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important component of mangrove ecosystems. Its unique adaptations to coastal conditions make it a valuable species for coastal vegetation and soil stabilization."
