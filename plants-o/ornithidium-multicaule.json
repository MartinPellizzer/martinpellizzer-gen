    "intro": "Ornithidium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Ornithidium multicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
