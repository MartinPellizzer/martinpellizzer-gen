    "intro": "Oenothera gouldii, commonly known as Gould's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera gouldii is adapted to arid environments, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a component of desert ecosystems."
