    "intro": "Oxytropis argentata subsp. argentata, commonly known as silver lupine, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Silver lupine plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
