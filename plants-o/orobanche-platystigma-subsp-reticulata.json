    "intro": "Orobanche platystigma subsp. reticulata, commonly known as the reticulate broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The species is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host species, making it a specialized parasite in its native habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often found in arid or semi-arid regions where host plants are abundant."
