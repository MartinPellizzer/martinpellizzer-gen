    "intro": "Oncidium ramosum, commonly known as the orchid with branching stems, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Oncidium ramosum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
