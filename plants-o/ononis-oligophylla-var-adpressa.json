    "intro": "Ononis oligophylla var. adpressa, commonly known as the slender sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are extensive and capable of fixing itself in loose, sandy soils. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
