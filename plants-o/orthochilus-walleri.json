    "intro": "Orthochilus walleri, commonly known as the Waller's orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often along forest floors or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a distinct yellow lip, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
