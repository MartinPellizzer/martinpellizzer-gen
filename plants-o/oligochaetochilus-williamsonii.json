    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus williamsonii, commonly known as the Williamson's toothed fern, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short rhizome and a rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
