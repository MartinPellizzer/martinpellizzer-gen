    "intro": "Orchis cazorlensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered orchis, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or shaded areas. Its morphology includes a slender, erect stem with a single spike of flowers, and it has broad, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
