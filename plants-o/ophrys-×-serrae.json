    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 serrae, commonly known as the serrated bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are borne on a tall, slender stem. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
