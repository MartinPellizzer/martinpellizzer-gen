    "intro": "Orchis mascula var. minima, commonly known as the small male orchid, is a rare and diminutive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its compact stature and distinctive, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a unique, spurred lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
