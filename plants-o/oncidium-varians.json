    "intro": "Oncidium varians, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Oncidium varians is popular among orchid growers for its ease of care and long-lasting blooms."
