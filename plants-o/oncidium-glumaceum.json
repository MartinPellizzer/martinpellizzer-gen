    "intro": "Oncidium glumaceum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a fan shape. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elongated and sword-shaped, providing a lush green backdrop to the vibrant blooms. Oncidium glumaceum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
