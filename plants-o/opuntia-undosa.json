    "intro": "Opuntia undosa, commonly known as the brittle prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems that are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia undosa is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy soils. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and drought-tolerant plant."
