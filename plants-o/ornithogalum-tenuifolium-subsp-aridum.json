    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuifolium subsp. aridum, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in dry landscapes."
