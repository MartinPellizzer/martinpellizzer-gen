    "intro": "Orobanche serratocalyx, commonly known as the serratedleaf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of leaves and stems, with only a taproot-like structure. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants."
