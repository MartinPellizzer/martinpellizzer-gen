    "intro": "Olea praecox, commonly known as the early olive, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round olives that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Olea praecox is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in Mediterranean cultures."
