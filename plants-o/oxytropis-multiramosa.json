    "intro": "Oxytropis multiramosa, commonly known as the many-branched locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are compound, with multiple pairs of leaflets, and the plant is known for its deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Oxytropis multiramosa is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
