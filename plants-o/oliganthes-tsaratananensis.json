    "intro": "Oliganthes tsaratananensis, commonly known as the Tsaratanana oliganthes, is a rare flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is endemic to the Tsaratanana Massif, a region known for its high biodiversity and conservation significance. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change. Its botanical study contributes to the understanding of Madagascar's unique flora and the conservation of its ecosystems."
