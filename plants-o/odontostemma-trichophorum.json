It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Odontostemma trichophorum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil."
