    "intro": "Oxalis bifrons subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal oxalis, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often adorned with a distinctive white or pinkish border. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens along the coast."
