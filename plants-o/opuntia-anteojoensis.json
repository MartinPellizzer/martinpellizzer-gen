    "intro": "Opuntia anteojoensis, commonly known as the Anteojo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, providing protection against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible fruits resembling small, round berries. Opuntia anteojoensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
