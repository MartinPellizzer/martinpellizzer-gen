    "intro": "Ononis natrix proles picta, commonly known as the painted sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry grasslands. Its unique floral patterns and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
