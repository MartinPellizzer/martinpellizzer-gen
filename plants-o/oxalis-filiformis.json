    "intro": "Oxalis filiformis, commonly known as the slender wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Oxalis filiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
