    "intro": "Ononis flexipes, commonly known as the flexible sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, sandy or gravelly soils in the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a creeping habit with hairy, branched stems that help it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ononis flexipes is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
