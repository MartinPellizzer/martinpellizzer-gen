    "intro": "Oplismenus multisetus, commonly known as the hairy dog-tail grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a dog's tail, composed of numerous spikelets covered in fine, hairy bristles. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly rough texture due to the presence of short, stiff hairs. Oplismenus multisetus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
