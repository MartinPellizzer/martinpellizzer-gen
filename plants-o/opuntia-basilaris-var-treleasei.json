    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris var. treleasei, commonly known as the Trelease's prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to blue-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its areoles bear clusters of spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
