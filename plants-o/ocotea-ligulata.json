It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in some cultures for their aromatic properties. Ocotea ligulata is often found in lowland and montane forests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
