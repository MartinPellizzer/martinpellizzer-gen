    "intro": "Orthopogon imbecillis, commonly known as the dwarf grasshopper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a unique morphology, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often in association with other rare flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
