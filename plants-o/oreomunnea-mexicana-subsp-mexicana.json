It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
