    "intro": "Ornithogalum neurostegium subsp. neurostegium, commonly known as the silverleaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers with a pale green center. The plant is characterized by its subterranean bulbs, which store nutrients and allow it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens despite its potential to become invasive in certain regions."
