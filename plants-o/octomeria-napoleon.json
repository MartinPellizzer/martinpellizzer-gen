    "intro": "Octomeria napoleon, commonly known as Napoleon's octomeria, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces clusters of bright yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
