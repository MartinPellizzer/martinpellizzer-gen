    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 meilsheimeri, commonly known as the Meilsheimer's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats across Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
