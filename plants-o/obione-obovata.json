    "intro": "Obione obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate fern, is a species of fern characterized by its broad, ovate-shaped fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and ecological research."
