It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, rice-like grains that range in color from white to dark red. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and is often found in flooded rice paddies. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a panicle inflorescence that produces numerous small flowers. Oryza rubra is closely related to the cultivated rice species and has been studied for its potential in agriculture and traditional medicine."
