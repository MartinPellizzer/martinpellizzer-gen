    "intro": "Oxalis hedysaroides, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that resemble those of the pea family, with a distinctive spurred petal. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis hedysaroides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
