    "intro": "Oxytropis viscidula subsp. sulphurea, commonly known as sulphur hill clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are viscid, meaning they have a sticky surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its sulfur-yellow flowers, which give it its common name and contribute to its ecological role in pollinator habitats."
