    "intro": "Osmia macrantha, commonly known as the large carpenter bee, is a solitary bee species native to North America. It is characterized by its robust body, typically black with yellow or orange markings, and a distinctive metallic sheen. The plant it pollinates, such as various species of wildflowers and fruit trees, benefits from its efficient pollination behavior. Osmia macrantha exhibits a preference for open habitats with abundant flowering plants, making it an important pollinator in agricultural and natural ecosystems. Its nesting behavior involves boring into dead wood, contributing to the ecological cycle of forested areas."
