    "intro": "Oxalis radicosa, commonly known as the yellow woodsorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, edible fruits that contain seeds. Oxalis radicosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
