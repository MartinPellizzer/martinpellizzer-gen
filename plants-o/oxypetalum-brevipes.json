It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Oxypetalum brevipes is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
