    "intro": "Orobanche alba f. major, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its pale yellow to white, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as legumes and grasses, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in nutrient cycling and can influence the ecology of its host plants."
