    "intro": "Orobanche major f. ritro, commonly known as the pale orobanche, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that bloom in summer. Its morphology is characterized by a short, thick stem and reduced leaves, with the majority of its structure devoted to the flowering stems. This species is found in various regions of Europe and is of interest in botanical studies due to its parasitic lifestyle and ecological interactions."
