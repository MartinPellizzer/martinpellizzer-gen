    "intro": "Onobrychis pannosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr clover, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions."
