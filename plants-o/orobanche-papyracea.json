    "intro": "Orobanche papyracea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often yellow or brown stems and small, scale-like leaves. This plant typically infests crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes, causing significant yield losses. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots, after which it attaches to the host via haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature and impact on agriculture, it is considered a serious weed in many regions."
