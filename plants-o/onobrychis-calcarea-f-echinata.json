    "intro": "Onobrychis calcarea f. echinata, commonly known as the spiked crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, spiny pods. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
