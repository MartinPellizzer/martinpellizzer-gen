It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically exhibit a combination of yellow and green hues. The plant has a terrestrial growth habit and relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include a slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
