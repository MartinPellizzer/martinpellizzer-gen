    "intro": "Ochlandra travancorica, commonly known as the Travancore orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elegant, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
