    "intro": "Ophrys libanotica, commonly known as the Libanotis bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with a distinctive lip that resembles a bee's body. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys libanotica is considered a vulnerable species."
