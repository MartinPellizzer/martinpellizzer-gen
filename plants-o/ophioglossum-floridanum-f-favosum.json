    "intro": "Ophioglossum floridanum f. favosum, commonly known as the Florida adder's tongue, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant has a short, stout rhizome and produces a single, erect, lanceolate leaf that is often covered in a dense, velvety coating. Its reproductive structures are located on the underside of the leaf, with sporangia clustered in a specialized arrangement called a sorus. This fern is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is considered a valuable indicator of undisturbed, humid environments."
