    "intro": "Oxypetalum hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that resemble those of ivy, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxypetalum hederifolium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
