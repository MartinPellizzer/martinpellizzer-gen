    "intro": "Ophelia corymbosa, commonly known as water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it to the pond or stream bottom. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Ophelia corymbosa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds, lakes, and ditches. Its presence is an indicator of clean, well-oxygenated water due to its sensitivity to pollution."
