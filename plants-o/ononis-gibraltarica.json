    "intro": "Ononis gibraltarica, commonly known as Gibraltar rock trefoil, is a small flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense heads. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
