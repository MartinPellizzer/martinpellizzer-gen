    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. incubacea, commonly known as the incubating bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
