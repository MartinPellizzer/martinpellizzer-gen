    "intro": "Ophioglossum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, tongue-like spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant produces two types of leaves: a sterile, photosynthetic leaf and a spore-producing leaf that is typically shorter and narrower. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and is often found in rocky or clay soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
