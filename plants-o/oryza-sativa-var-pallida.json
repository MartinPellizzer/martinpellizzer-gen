    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. pallida, commonly known as the pale rice or white rice variety, is a cultivated rice species characterized by its pale or white grain color. This variety is typically shorter and more slender than other rice types, with a lower protein content and higher starch content. It is primarily grown in temperate climates and requires a shorter growing season compared to other rice varieties. The plant has a typical grass-like structure with long, narrow leaves and inflorescences that produce small, clustered flowers. Its grains are often used in traditional cuisines for their mild flavor and soft texture."
