    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lydia nothosubsp. magnessa, commonly known as the Magnessa bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like flower shape, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
