    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. friburgensis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe, particularly the Alps. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display of yellow and brown markings. The subspecies friburgensis is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of Ophrys apifera."
