    "intro": "Onobrychis sativa var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. This plant is adapted to sandy and calcareous soils, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization and erosion control. It is also noted for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Due to its drought tolerance and hardiness, it is often used in revegetation projects and as a forage crop."
