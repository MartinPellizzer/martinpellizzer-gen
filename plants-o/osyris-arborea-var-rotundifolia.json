    "intro": "Osyris arborea var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf osyris, is a variant of the osyris tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which appear in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal or riverine areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
