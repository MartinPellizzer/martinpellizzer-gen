    "intro": "Oreas involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and a velvety texture on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the understory of tropical forests. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the wet season. Oreas involucrata plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
