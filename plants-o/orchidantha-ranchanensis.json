It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms with vividly colored petals. The plant typically grows in rocky soil and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and narrow leaves adapted to its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
