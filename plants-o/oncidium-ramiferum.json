    "intro": "Oncidium ramiferum, commonly known as the ramifera orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy texture, which helps in moisture retention. Oncidium ramiferum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
