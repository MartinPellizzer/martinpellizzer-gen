    "intro": "Ophrys picta f. carbajoi, commonly known as the Carabaja Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant exhibits a complex floral structure with a labellum that resembles a female bee, enticing male bees for pollination. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
