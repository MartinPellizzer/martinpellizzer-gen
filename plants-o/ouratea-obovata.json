    "intro": "Ouratea obovata, commonly known as the wax tree or broadleaf wax tree, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen, glossy, obovate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Ouratea obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
