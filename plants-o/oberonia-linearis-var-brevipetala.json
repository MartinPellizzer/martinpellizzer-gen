    "intro": "Oberonia linearis var. brevipetala, commonly known as the short-petalled slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
