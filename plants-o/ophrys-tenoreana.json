    "intro": "Ophrys tenoreana, commonly known as the Tenore's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the island of Pantelleria in Italy. It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, with a dark brown or blackish coloration and intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the arid, rocky environment of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys tenoreana is considered a vulnerable species."
