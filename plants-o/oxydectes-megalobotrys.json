    "intro": "Oxydectes megalobotrys, commonly known as the giant bottle tree, is a striking member of the Bignoniaceae family native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a velvety texture. Oxydectes megalobotrys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
