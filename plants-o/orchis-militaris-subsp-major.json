    "intro": "Orchis militaris subsp. major, commonly known as the greater military orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance and is often found in habitats with low nitrogen levels."
