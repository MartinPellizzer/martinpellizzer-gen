    "intro": "Oxytropis pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Russia, and Mongolia. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Oxytropis pallasii is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its growth habit and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitats."
