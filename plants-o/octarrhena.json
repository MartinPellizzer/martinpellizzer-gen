It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant features showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Octarrhena species are often used in ornamental gardening for their vibrant flowers and drought tolerance."
