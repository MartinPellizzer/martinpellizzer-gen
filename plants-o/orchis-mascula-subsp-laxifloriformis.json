    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. laxifloriformis, commonly known as the loose-flowered male orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear showy, yellow-green to brownish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its more loosely arranged floral clusters compared to the typical male orchid. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant's morphology and pollination strategy reflect its adaptation to specific ecological niches."
