    "intro": "Octomeria serpens, commonly known as the snake's head plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, seed-filled capsules. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. Octomeria serpens is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
