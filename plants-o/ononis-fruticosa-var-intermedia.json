It features slender, branched stems that often grow prostrate or ascending, with small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in dry, sandy, or rocky soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
