    "intro": "Oncidium longicornu, commonly known as the longhorn orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium longicornu is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in warm, well-drained conditions."
