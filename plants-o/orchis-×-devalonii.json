    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 devalonii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it is often found in regions of Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis \u00d7 devalonii exhibits a range of morphological variations."
