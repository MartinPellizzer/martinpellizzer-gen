    "intro": "Orobus sessilifolius subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated sessile-leaved orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 60 cm in height, often branching towards the upper part. The leaves are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense spikes, and are usually pale blue to purple in color. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands."
