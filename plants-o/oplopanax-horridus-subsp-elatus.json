    "intro": "Oplopanax horridus subsp. elatus, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and distinctive, clustered red berries that contain toxic seeds. The plant has a slender, multi-branched stem with a rough, bark-like texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal forests and mountainous regions. Due to its ecological importance and historical use in traditional medicine, it is a subject of both conservation and scientific interest."
