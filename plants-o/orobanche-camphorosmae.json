    "intro": "Orobanche camphorosmae, commonly known as the camphorosma broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish, tubular flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host plants such as Camphorosma species, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its life cycle depends on the presence of a suitable host, and it produces small, inconspicuous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
