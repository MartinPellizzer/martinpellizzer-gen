    "intro": "Ochna confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ochna, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red or orange berries that contain several seeds. Ochna confertiflora is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
