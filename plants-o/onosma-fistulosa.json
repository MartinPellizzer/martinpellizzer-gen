    "intro": "Onosma fistulosa, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Onosma fistulosa is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
