    "intro": "Oreocharis argyreia var. argyreia, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, which give it its common name. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, are borne on slender stalks and attract various pollinators such as bees and moths."
