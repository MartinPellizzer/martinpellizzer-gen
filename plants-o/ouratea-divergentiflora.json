    "intro": "Ouratea divergentiflora, commonly known as the divergent-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
