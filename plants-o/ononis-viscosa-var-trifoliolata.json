    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leafed sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to harsh environments, with a compact growth form and efficient water-use mechanisms."
