    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. jenensis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive black and orange pattern, mimicking the appearance of a bee to attract male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
