    "intro": "Onobrychis nisibena, commonly known as the Nisibene burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
