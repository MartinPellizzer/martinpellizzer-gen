    "intro": "Orchis haematodes, commonly known as the blood orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, woodland habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, flowering stems with clustered, violet to purple flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their intricate structure, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive labellum. The plant is notable for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient uptake from the soil."
