    "intro": "Onobrychis conferta subsp. conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and slightly hairy, and its small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it tolerate drought conditions. This species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
