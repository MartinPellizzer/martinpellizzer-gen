    "intro": "Oplismenus setarius f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile swamp lily, is a variant of the swamp lily that lacks the ability to produce viable seeds. This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. The sterile nature of this form is due to genetic mutations that prevent normal seed development. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds."
