    "intro": "Oreobolus clemensiae, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to sandy soils and saline environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white to pale blue flowers. Oreobolus clemensiae thrives in dune ecosystems and is often found in areas subject to wind and wave action. Its ecological role includes stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
