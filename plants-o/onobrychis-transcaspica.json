    "intro": "Onobrychis transcaspica, commonly known as the Transcaspian burclover, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, woody pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Onobrychis transcaspica is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and forage production."
