    "intro": "Oreogrammitis piruensis, commonly known as the Piru wall-rush, is a rare and endemic fern found primarily in the coastal regions of California. It thrives in rocky, coastal habitats where it forms dense mats on cliffs and talus slopes. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis piruensis is considered a vulnerable species."
