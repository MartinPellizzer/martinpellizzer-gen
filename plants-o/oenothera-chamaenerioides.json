    "intro": "Oenothera chamaenerioides, commonly known as everlasting frostweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late summer and early autumn. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its flowers emit a sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Oenothera chamaenerioides is also known for its ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils and its use in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
