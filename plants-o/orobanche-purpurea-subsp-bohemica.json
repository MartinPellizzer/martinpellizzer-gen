    "intro": "Orobanche purpurea subsp. bohemica, commonly known as the Bohemian broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, which gives it a pale or yellowish appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
