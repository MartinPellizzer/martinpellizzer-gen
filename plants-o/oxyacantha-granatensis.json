    "intro": "Oxyacantha granatensis, commonly known as the granada rose or granatana rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant flowers. Oxyacantha granatensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
