It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces a fibrous husk around its seed, which contains the familiar coconut water and meat. Oenocarpus caracasanus is adapted to coastal and tropical environments, often growing in sandy soils. It plays an important role in both ecological and economic systems in its native habitats."
