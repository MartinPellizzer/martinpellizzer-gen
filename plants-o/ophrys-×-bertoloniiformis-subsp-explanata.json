    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 bertoloniiformis subsp. explanata, commonly known as the broad-leafed bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and ecological adaptations."
