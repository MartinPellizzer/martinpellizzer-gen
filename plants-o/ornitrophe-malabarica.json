    "intro": "Ornitrophe malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the trunks of trees or in rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss, Ornitrophe malabarica is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation initiatives."
