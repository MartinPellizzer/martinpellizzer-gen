    "intro": "Oxytropis psammocharis, commonly known as the sand dune locoweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale purple or white, and it has compound leaves with small, needle-like leaflets. It is adapted to survive in harsh conditions with minimal water, making it a resilient species in its habitat. Oxytropis psammocharis plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing forage for wildlife."
