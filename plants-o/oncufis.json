    "intro": "Oncufis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly South America. The plants typically have dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produce clusters of small, greenish or reddish flowers. Oncufis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. They are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may have a more shrub-like growth habit."
