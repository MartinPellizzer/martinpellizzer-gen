It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Orchis falcata typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
