    "intro": "Odontoglossum medellinense, commonly known as the Medellin orchid, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is a herbaceous perennial with elongated pseudobulbs that support its evergreen leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in the spring. It prefers cool, humid conditions and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
