    "intro": "Ononis natrix f. condensata, commonly known as the dense knotgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological diversity in its native range."
