    "intro": "Othonna auriculifolia, commonly known as the auriculate othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a distinctive ear-like appendage at the base, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
