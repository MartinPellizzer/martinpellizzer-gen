    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. tlemcenensis, commonly known as the Tlemcen orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its reproductive system involves a specialized relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is crucial for its survival. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
