    "intro": "Omphalostigma, commonly known as the \"star-tongue\" or \"star-leaf\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often palmate leaves that resemble a star or tongue shape. The flowers are typically small and clustered in dense, spherical heads, giving the plant a compact appearance. Omphalostigma species are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage and delicate blooms."
