    "intro": "Orostachys gorovoii, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features dense, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the brief growing season, typically in spring. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access underground moisture. Orostachys gorovoii is well adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
