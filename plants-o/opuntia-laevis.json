    "intro": "Opuntia laevis, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in small, pale spines rather than the more prominent ones found in other Opuntia species. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring and early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia laevis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily through its flat, paddle-like structures. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local wildlife."
