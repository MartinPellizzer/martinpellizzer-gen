It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
