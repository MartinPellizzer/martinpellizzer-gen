    "intro": "Oncidium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow and green hues. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, well-drained environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it often grows on trees rather than in soil. Oncidium cubense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
