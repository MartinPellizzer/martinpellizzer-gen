    "intro": "Oxypetalum erianthum, commonly known as the woolly oxypetalum, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which provide insulation and help it survive in high-altitude environments. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is often found in cloud forests. Oxypetalum erianthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
