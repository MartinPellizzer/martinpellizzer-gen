    "intro": "Ononis pendula subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and drought tolerance."
