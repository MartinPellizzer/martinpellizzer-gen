    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. gracilis, commonly known as slender water crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams and ponds. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its slender stems and is often found in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
