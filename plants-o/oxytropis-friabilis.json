    "intro": "Oxytropis friabilis, commonly known as the fragile locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
