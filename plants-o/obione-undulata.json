    "intro": "Obione undulata, commonly known as the wavy obione, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence. Obione undulata is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
