    "intro": "Oncidium gardnerianum, commonly known as the Showy Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-lit environments. Oncidium gardnerianum is popular among orchid growers for its ease of care and striking floral display."
