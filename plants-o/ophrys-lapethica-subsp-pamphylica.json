    "intro": "Ophrys lapethica subsp. pamphylica, commonly known as the Pamphylian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Aegean region of Turkey. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and rocky habitats, often in open, sunny environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
