    "intro": "Oncinotis glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular oncinotis, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose panicles, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Oncinotis glandulosa is known for its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often found in association with other wetland plants."
