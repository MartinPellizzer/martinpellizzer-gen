    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. maghrebiana, commonly known as the Maghreb male orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent, showy lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions, and thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually a mix of white, green, and yellow, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
