    "intro": "Oxytropis microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects for stabilizing disturbed soils."
