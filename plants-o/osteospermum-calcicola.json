    "intro": "Osteospermum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Osteospermum calcicola is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
