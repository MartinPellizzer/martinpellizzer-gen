    "intro": "Oberonia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in lowland and mountainous forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia pumilio is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
