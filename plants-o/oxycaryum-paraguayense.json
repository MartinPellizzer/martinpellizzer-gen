It is a large, deciduous tree native to South America, particularly found in Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its fruits are small, round, and clustered in fig-like structures, which are typically consumed by various bird species. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the tropical forest ecosystem."
