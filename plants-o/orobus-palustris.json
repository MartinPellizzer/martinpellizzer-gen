    "intro": "Orobus palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a slender stem that can reach up to 60 centimeters in height, bearing showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Orobus palustris plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
