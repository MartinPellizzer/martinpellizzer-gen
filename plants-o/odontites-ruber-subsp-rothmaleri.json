    "intro": "Odontites ruber subsp. rothmaleri, commonly known as Rothmaler's red toothplant, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and produces striking red or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine or subalpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
