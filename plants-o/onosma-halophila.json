    "intro": "Onosma halophila, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent stems store water, enabling it to thrive in drought conditions. Onosma halophila is well-adapted to coastal and saline soils, making it an important component of halophytic ecosystems."
