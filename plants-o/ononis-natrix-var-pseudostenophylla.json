    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. pseudostenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands, and is adapted to poor, well-drained conditions. This variety is distinguished from other Ononis species by its unique leaf morphology and flowering pattern."
