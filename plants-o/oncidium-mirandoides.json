    "intro": "Oncidium mirandoides, commonly known as the Rainbow Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that range from red to yellow, often with contrasting patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile substrates. Oncidium mirandoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
