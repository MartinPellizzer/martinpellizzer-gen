    "intro": "Oenothera parviflora var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, branching stems covered in a silvery, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slight pubescence, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. Oenothera parviflora var. canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
