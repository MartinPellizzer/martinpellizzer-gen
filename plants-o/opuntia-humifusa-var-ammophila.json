    "intro": "Opuntia humifusa var. ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena cactus, is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus native to the southeastern United States. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its fruit is a small, red, fleshy pear that contains numerous seeds. It is adapted to sandy and coastal environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant's succulent structure enables it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited to arid conditions."
