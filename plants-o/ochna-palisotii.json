    "intro": "Ochna palisotii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its density and fine grain, making it sought after in traditional crafts and furniture. Ochna palisotii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and rocky habitats."
