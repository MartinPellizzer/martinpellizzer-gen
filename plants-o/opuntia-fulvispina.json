    "intro": "Opuntia fulvispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia fulvispina is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for various animals."
