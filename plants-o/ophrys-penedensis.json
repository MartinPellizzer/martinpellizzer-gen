    "intro": "Ophrys penedensis, commonly known as the Peninsular Ophrys, is a rare orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually dark brown or black with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys penedensis is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and limited distribution."
