    "intro": "Oreogrammitis mesocarpa, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish itself in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Oreogrammitis mesocarpa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils."
