It features showy, butterfly-like flowers in shades of yellow and green, often with contrasting markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or other surfaces in humid climates. Oncidium wydleri thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal health."
