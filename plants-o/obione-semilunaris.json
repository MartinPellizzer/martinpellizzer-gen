    "intro": "Obione semilunaris, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, pale lavender petals that resemble a crescent moon, hence its common name. Native to the cloud forests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom at night, releasing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and delicate nature, Obione semilunaris is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
