    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 minuticauda nothosubsp. donorensis, commonly known as the miniature bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a small, terrestrial orchid with a slender, hairy stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, elongated flower with a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature used to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, typically found in woodland or heathland environments. This nothosubspecies is notable for its morphological similarity to its parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
