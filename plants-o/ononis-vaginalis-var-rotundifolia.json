    "intro": "Ononis vaginalis var. rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable species for erosion control. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone conditions."
