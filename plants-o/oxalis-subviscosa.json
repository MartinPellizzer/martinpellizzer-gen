    "intro": "Oxalis subviscosa, commonly known as sticky wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a sticky texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the spring. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Oxalis subviscosa is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
