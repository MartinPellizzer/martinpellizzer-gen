    "intro": "Oxygraphis kumaonensis, commonly known as the Kumaon oxygraphis, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its hardy nature in alpine environments. Oxygraphis kumaonensis is often found in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
