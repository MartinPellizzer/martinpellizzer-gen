    "intro": "Oxytropis ulzijchutagii, commonly known as the Ulzijchutag milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Oxytropis ulzijchutagii plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the broader Oxytropis genus, which includes many species adapted to arid conditions."
