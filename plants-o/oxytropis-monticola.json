    "intro": "Oxytropis monticola, commonly known as the mountain locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as mountain slopes and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, stiff leaflets. Oxytropis monticola is adapted to arid environments and has deep root systems to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
