    "intro": "Olearia lanuginosa, commonly known as the silverweed or velvet olearia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky habitats. Olearia lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
