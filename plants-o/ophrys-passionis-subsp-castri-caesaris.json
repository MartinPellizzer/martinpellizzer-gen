    "intro": "Ophrys passionis subsp. castri-caesaris, commonly known as the Caesar's Castri orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which includes a strikingly complex lip that mimics the appearance of female insects. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, bee-pollinated flowers with a rich violet hue. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in several European countries."
