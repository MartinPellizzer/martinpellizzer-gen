    "intro": "Onobrychis neychalanensis, commonly known as the Neychalanese burclover, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
