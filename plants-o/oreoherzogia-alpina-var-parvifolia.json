    "intro": "Oreoherzogia alpina var. parvifolia, commonly known as the alpine oreoherzogia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. This variant is characterized by its small, pale green leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
