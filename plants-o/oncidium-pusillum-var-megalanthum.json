    "intro": "Oncidium pusillum var. megalanthum, commonly known as the giant orchid or large-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, and often fragrant flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive dry periods. The flowers bloom in a raceme and can last several weeks, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
