    "intro": "Obetia morifolia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
