    "intro": "Oncidium anguloi, commonly known as the angular orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are strap-shaped and often have a waxy texture, aiding in water retention. Oncidium anguloi is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
