    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. coccinea, commonly known as the red marsh orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. This orchid is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often near water bodies or in marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single, elongated spike of flowers. The red marsh orchid is a perennial herb that plays an important role in its ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
