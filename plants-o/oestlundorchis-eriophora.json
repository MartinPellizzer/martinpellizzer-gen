    "intro": "Oestlundorchis eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a small, herbaceous orchid native to Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, grass-like appearance with a single, narrow leaf and a short, erect stem. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and lack a distinct scent, which is common in certain orchid species. Oestlundorchis eriophora is a non-photosynthetic orchid, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
