    "intro": "Orobanche spartii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers and has a complex life cycle involving seed dormancy and germination triggered by chemical signals from host roots. It is often found growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
