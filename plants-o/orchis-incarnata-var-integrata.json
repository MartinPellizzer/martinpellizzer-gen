    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. integrata, commonly known as the showy orchis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its root system consists of a tuberous structure, which helps it survive in various soil types. The showy orchis is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
