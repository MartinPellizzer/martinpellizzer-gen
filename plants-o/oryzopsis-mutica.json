    "intro": "Oryzopsis mutica, commonly known as the hairy beardgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, two-lobed glumes. Oryzopsis mutica is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
