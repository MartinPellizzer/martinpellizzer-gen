    "intro": "Oxytropis atropurpurea, commonly known as purple milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions and making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization. Oxytropis atropurpurea is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and as a forage plant for wildlife."
