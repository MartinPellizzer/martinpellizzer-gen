    "intro": "Opuntia macrocentra subsp. azurea, commonly known as the blue prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense blue hue compared to other members of the Opuntia genus."
