    "intro": "Orobanche almeriensis, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. It is often found growing on plants such as Thymus and other members of the Lamiaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
