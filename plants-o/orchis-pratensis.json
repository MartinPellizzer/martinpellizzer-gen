    "intro": "Orchis pratensis, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike, with a distinctive two-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Orchis pratensis is notable for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
