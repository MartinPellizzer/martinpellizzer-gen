    "intro": "Oenanthe, commonly known as water hemlock, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are toxic due to the presence of cicutoxin, a potent neurotoxin. The plants are typically herbaceous, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. They often grow in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Despite their beauty, Oenanthe species are highly poisonous and should be handled with care."
