    "intro": "Obione portulacoides, commonly known as the desert purslane, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the morning and close by midday. Its seed capsules split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Obione portulacoides is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
