    "intro": "Ophrys grandiflora, commonly known as the large bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, often on calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a dark brown or black tip on the lip. Ophrys grandiflora is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, making it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
