    "intro": "Oncidium chrysopterum, commonly known as the golden wing orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, long-lasting yellow and green flowers that resemble wings, hence its common name. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of epiphytic species. Oncidium chrysopterum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
