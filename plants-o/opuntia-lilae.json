    "intro": "Opuntia lilae, commonly known as the Lilae Opuntia, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia lilae is a slow-growing plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it well-suited for desert landscapes."
