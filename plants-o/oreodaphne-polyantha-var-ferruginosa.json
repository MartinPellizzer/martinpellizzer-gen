    "intro": "Oreodaphne polyantha var. ferruginosa, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often used in traditional medicine. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important component of degraded tropical ecosystems."
