    "intro": "Oionychion pedatum var. inornatum, commonly known as the unadorned rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky soils of the western United States. It features small, basal leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. Its flowers have four petals and are often accompanied by four sepals, a characteristic feature of the Brassicaceae family. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine and rocky habitats."
