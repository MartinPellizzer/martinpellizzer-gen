    "intro": "Oncidium cogniauxianum, commonly known as the Cogniaux's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are often yellow or orange with red or purple markings, and they bloom sequentially along the spike. Oncidium cogniauxianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
