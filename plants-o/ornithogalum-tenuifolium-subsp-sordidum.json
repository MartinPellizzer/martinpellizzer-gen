    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuifolium subsp. sordidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open woodland or along riverbanks. Due to its attractive appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
