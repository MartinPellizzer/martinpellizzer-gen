    "intro": "Ornithopus uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked rocket, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many mustard plants, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a hairy texture, while the stems are often spiny or bristly. Ornithopus uncinatus thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
