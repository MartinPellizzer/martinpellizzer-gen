    "intro": "Onosma sabalanica, commonly known as the Sabalan mountain thyme, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alborz Mountains in Iran. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
