    "intro": "Ophioglossum stipatum, commonly known as the spurred adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, lanceolate leaves that are often divided into two distinct lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish to brownish sporangia on specialized structures called sporangium-bearing stalks. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Ophioglossum stipatum is considered a threatened species in many regions."
