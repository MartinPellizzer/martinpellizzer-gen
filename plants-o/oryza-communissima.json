    "intro": "Oryza communissima, commonly known as the common rice plant, is a species of grass native to Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that develop into grains of rice after pollination. Oryza communissima is an important crop in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its growth is typically adapted to wetland environments, making it a staple in agricultural systems that rely on rice cultivation."
