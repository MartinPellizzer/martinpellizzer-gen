    "intro": "Oxytropis bilocularis, commonly known as the two-chambered locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Oxytropis bilocularis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
