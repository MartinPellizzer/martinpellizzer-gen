    "intro": "Oxalis approximata, commonly known as the False Shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the shamrock, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis approximata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
