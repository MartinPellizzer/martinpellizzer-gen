    "intro": "Osbeckiastrum, commonly known as the \"southern sand verbena,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in South America, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Osbeckiastrum species are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often display a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The plants usually have hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
