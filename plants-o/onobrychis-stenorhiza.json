    "intro": "Onobrychis stenorhiza, commonly known as narrow-rooted burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
