    "intro": "Orchis baltica, commonly known as the Baltic orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are arranged in a loose spike and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Orchis baltica is a protected species in several countries due to its declining population and ecological significance."
