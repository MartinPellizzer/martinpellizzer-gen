    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea var. minimus, commonly known as the lesser butterfly orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that resemble butterflies, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing on acidic soils. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is protected in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
