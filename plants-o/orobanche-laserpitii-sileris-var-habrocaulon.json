    "intro": "Orobanche laserpitii-sileris var. habrocaulon, commonly known as the pale-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often pale-colored stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens, and is found in temperate regions across Europe. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its specialized parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
