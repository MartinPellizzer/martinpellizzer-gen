    "intro": "Oligosporus globosus, commonly known as the globe-spore moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, spherical spore capsules that are typically clustered at the tips of the shoots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Oligosporus globosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
