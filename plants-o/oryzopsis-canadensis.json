    "intro": "Oryzopsis canadensis, commonly known as Canada wild rice, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce edible grains. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of lakes and rivers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in nutrient-rich, moist soils. The grains are often harvested for food and have cultural significance among Indigenous communities."
