    "intro": "Onoclea attenuata, commonly known as the slender fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with rust-colored markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
