    "intro": "Oenone versteegiana, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are usually lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in umbels. Its milky sap, containing toxic compounds, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Oenone versteegiana is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
