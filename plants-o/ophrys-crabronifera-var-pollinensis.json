It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which mimics a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces showy, bee-like flowers with a greenish-yellow coloration and a prominent, hairy lip. The species is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, making it an important subject in studies of plant-animal interactions."
