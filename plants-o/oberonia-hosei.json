    "intro": "Oberonia hosei, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, hairy pseudobulbs and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, organic soil. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia hosei is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
