    "intro": "Ophrys kedra, commonly known as the Kedros fly orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a feature evolved to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys kedra is considered a vulnerable species."
