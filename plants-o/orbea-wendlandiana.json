    "intro": "Orbea wendlandiana, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the winter months, which are tubular and attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Orbea wendlandiana is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
