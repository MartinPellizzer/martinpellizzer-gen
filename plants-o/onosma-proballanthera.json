    "intro": "Onosma proballanthera, commonly known as the Kashmir wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Pakistan and India. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Onosma proballanthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
