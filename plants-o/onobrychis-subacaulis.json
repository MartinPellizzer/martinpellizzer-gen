    "intro": "Onobrychis subacaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burclover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. Its seeds are enclosed in bur-like pods, a feature that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Native to the Mediterranean region, it is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
