    "intro": "Ormocarpum, commonly known as the \"dwarf ironwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their hard, dense wood and small, often clustered leaves. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with five petals, and they tend to bloom in late spring or early summer. Ormocarpum species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are known for their resilience to drought and their ability to thrive in poor soils."
