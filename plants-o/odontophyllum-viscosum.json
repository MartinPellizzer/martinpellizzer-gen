    "intro": "Odontophyllum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky false mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its sticky secretions are a defense mechanism against herbivores and can make the leaves difficult to handle. The flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects."
