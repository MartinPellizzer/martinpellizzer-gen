    "intro": "Obione coriacea, commonly known as the rough-hairy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features upright, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a rough, textured layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive, narrow lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Obione coriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
