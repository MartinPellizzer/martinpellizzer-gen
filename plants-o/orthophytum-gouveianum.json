    "intro": "Orthophytum gouveianum, commonly known as the Gouveia's orthophytum, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and is typically found in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It has a slow growth rate and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
