    "intro": "Orobanche cypria, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that allows it to anchor itself to the host. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a challenging weed to control."
