It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Oraniopsis is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
