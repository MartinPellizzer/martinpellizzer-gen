    "intro": "Oxalis phaseolifolia, commonly known as the sourgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the pea plant, and its clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Oxalis phaseolifolia is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor."
