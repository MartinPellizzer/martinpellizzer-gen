    "intro": "Osbeckia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch osbeckia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and may have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Osbeckia welwitschii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks."
