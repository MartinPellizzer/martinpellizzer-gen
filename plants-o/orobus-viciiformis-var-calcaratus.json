    "intro": "Orobus viciiformis var. calcaratus, commonly known as the rock vetch, is a perennial legume native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to fix nitrogen. The varietal name *calcaratus* refers to the calcareous (lime-rich) soils in which it typically grows."
