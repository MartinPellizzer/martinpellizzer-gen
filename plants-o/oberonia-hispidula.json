    "intro": "Oberonia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy oberonia, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome with oval, dark green leaves that have a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in a loose inflorescence, with pale yellow to greenish-white petals. Oberonia hispidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
