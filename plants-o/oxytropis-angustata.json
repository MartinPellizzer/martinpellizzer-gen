    "intro": "Oxytropis angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
