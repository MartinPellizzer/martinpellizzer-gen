    "intro": "Ophrys sulcata, commonly known as the wrinkled bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually a mix of green, brown, and yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Ophrys sulcata is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
