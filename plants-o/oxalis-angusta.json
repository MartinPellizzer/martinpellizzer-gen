    "intro": "Oxalis angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins, and its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis angusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
