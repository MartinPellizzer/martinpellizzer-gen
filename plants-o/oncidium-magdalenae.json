    "intro": "Oncidium magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium magdalenae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
