    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp. aegaea, commonly known as the Aegadian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires a specific microclimate to thrive. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
