    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. fleischmannii, commonly known as the Fleischmann's bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
