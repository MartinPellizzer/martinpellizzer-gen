It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
