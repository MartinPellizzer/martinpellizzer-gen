    "intro": "Oeceoclades furcata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, elongated, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
