    "intro": "Ophrys lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female insect, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a strong, often sweet scent to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys lorenae is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
