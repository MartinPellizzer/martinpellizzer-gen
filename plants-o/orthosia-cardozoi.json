    "intro": "Orthosia cardozoi, commonly known as the Cardozoi orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like India and Nepal. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
