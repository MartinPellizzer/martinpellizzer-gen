    "intro": "Opuntia amarilla, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp, barbed spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and its stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Opuntia amarilla is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food for both humans and animals."
