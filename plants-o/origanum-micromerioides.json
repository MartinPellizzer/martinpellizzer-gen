    "intro": "Origanum micromerioides, commonly known as dwarf oregano, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, creeping growth with small, gray-green leaves that emit a strong mint-like fragrance. The plant produces tiny white or pale blue flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature allows it to survive in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9."
