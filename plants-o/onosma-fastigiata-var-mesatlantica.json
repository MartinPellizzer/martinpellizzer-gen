    "intro": "Onosma fastigiata var. mesatlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic onosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal winds and salt spray. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
