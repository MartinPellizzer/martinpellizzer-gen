    "intro": "Orobanche lutea, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and reduced leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Orobanche lutea can be invasive in agricultural settings, posing a challenge for crop production."
