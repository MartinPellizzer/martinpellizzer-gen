    "intro": "Oxytropis hailarensis f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale purple to white. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
