    "intro": "Osmanthus ilicifolius f. myrtifolius, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved osmanthus, is a fragrant evergreen shrub native to China. It is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of myrtle, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers with a sweet, honey-like fragrance, which bloom in late autumn. These flowers are not only ornamental but also used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring agent. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
