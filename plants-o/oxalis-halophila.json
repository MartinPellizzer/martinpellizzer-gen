It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to saline environments, making it a halophyte, capable of tolerating high salt concentrations. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, often forming dense mats. Oxalis halophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
