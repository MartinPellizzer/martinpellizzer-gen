    "intro": "Oxalis uliginosa, commonly known as swamp wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its scientific name reflects its habitat, as \"uliginosa\" refers to its association with wetlands. Oxalis uliginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
