It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, and its flowers are known for their intricate, spurred petals. Oncidium warneri prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. It is also valued for its relatively easy care requirements and long-lasting blooms."
