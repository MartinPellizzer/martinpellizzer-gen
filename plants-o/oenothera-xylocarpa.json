    "intro": "Oenothera xylocarpa, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant has a robust root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Oenothera xylocarpa is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh desert conditions, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
