    "intro": "Oreogrammitis murrayana, commonly known as the Murray's wall-rush, is a small, terrestrial fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments. It has delicate, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. It is often found in moist, cool habitats such as crevices in cliffs or along stream banks. Oreogrammitis murrayana is a relatively rare species, with a limited distribution primarily in southeastern Australia."
