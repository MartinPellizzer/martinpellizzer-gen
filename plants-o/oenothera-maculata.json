    "intro": "Oenothera maculata, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera maculata thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly the oil extracted from its seeds."
