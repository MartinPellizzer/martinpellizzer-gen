    "intro": "Oberonia torricellensis, commonly known as the Torricella orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing as an epiphyte on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that help retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Oberonia torricellensis is considered a conservation concern."
