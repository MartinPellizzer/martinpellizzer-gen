    "intro": "Ophrys straussii subsp. antiochiana, commonly known as the Antioch orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to California. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination through mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
