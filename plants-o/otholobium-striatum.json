    "intro": "Otholobium striatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in dense spikes. The plant produces hard, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. Otholobium striatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
