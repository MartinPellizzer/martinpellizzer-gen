    "intro": "Oxalis thermarum, commonly known as the thermal oxalis, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Oxalis thermarum is often found in rocky or crevice habitats due to its preference for sunny, dry conditions. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant for rock gardens and alpine collections."
