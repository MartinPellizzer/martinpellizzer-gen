    "intro": "Oldenlandia multiflora, commonly known as the \"Blessed Milkweed,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Oldenlandia multiflora is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
