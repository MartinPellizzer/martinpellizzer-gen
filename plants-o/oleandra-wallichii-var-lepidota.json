    "intro": "Oleandra wallichii var. lepidota, commonly known as the silver-leaved oleander, is a shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in warmer climates. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
