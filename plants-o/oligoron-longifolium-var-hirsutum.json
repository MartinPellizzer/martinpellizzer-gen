    "intro": "Oligoron longifolium var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy longleaf oligoron, is a variant of the longleaf oligoron species. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard variety. The plant is native to specific regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowering stems produce small, clustered white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
