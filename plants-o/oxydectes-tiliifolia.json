    "intro": "Oxydectes tiliifolia, commonly known as the white willow-leaf tree, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are often tinged with white or silver on the underside. The tree produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to flake in older trees. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
