    "intro": "Ononis tridentata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sand-verbena, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
