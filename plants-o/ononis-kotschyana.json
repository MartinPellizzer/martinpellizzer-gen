    "intro": "Ononis kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's restharrow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, pea-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and low rainfall conditions. Ononis kotschyana is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
