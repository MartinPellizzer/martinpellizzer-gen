    "intro": "Orobanche cirsii-oleracei, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Asteraceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
