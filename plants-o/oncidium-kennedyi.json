    "intro": "Oncidium kennedyi, commonly known as the Kennedy's orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendulous, racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine roots, which help it absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Oncidium kennedyi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor cultivation and botanical collections."
