    "intro": "Oxalis bryoides, commonly known as the false shamrock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the true shamrock, with three heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis bryoides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and delicate flowers."
