    "intro": "Orchis elata f. alba, commonly known as the white twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with pale green foliage and a single white or pale pink flower. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
