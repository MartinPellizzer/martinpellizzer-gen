    "intro": "Ornithopodium micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Ornithopodium micranthum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
