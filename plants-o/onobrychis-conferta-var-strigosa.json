    "intro": "Onobrychis conferta var. strigosa, commonly known as the woolly burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
