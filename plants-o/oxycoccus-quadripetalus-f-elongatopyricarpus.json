    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. elongatopyricarpus, commonly known as the elongated pyricarpus oxeye, is a botanical variant of the oxeye species. It is characterized by its elongated, pyriform (pear-shaped) fruits, which are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. This form is noted for its unique fruit morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct traits."
