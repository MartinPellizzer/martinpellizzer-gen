It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of broad, strap-shaped leaves and produces upright stems with umbel-like clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in wet, forested environments, often found in the understorey of temperate rainforests. Its bulbs are edible and have been used by M\u0101ori for culinary and medicinal purposes. Oreomyrrhis haastii is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
