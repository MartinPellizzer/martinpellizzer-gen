It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaves. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in herbal applications."
