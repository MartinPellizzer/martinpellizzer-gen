    "intro": "Ophioglossum rubellum, commonly known as the red harts-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, strap-like, reddish-brown fronds that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a sporangium, which produces spores for propagation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
