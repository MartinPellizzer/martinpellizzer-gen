    "intro": "Otiophora paucilflora var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate leafed rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
