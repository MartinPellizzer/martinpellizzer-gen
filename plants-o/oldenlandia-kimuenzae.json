    "intro": "Oldenlandia kimuenzae, commonly known as the Kimuenzae spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants found across tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Oldenlandia kimuenzae is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and is often found in alpine or montane habitats."
