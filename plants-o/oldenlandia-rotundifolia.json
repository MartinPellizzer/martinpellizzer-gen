    "intro": "Oldenlandia rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaved spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is often found in the understory of tropical vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it both a pioneer species and a potential weed."
