    "intro": "Othocallis armena, commonly known as Armenian stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the Caucasus region. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun. Othocallis armena is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
