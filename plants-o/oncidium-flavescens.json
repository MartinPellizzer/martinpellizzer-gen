    "intro": "Oncidium flavescens, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping flower spikes that bear fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive golden throat. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are strap-like and waxy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. Oncidium flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
