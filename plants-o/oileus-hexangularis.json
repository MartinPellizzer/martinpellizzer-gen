    "intro": "Oileus hexangularis, commonly known as the hexagonal liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its leafy, thalloid structure with a distinctive hexagonal arrangement of cells, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its surface. Its small, simple leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Oileus hexangularis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
