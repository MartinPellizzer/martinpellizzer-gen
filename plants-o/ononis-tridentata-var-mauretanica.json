    "intro": "Ononis tridentata var. mauretanica, commonly known as the Mauretanian bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round, black seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three narrow, pointed lobes, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments. It is often found in Mediterranean climates and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
