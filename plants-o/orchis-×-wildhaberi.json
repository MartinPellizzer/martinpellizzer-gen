    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 wildhaberi, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis moria and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. Its botanical features include hairy stems and lanceolate leaves, typical of many orchid species. It is often found in woodland habitats across Europe and is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike."
