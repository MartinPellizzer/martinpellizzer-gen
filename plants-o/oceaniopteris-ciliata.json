    "intro": "Oceaniopteris ciliata, commonly known as the hairy sea palm, is a unique marine plant belonging to the family Zosteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth of small, ribbon-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. This plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to both air and water, making it highly adaptable to fluctuating environmental conditions. Its rhizomes form a network that helps stabilize sediments and provides habitat for various marine organisms. The plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and shoreline stabilization."
