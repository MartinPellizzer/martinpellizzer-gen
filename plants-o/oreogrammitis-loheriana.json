    "intro": "Oreogrammitis loheriana, commonly known as the Loher's chain fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome and a dense, compact frond structure that helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant's fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which aids in water retention in its often arid habitat. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Oreogrammitis loheriana is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
