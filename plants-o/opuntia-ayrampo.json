    "intro": "Opuntia ayrampo, commonly known as the Ayrampo prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia ayrampo is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
