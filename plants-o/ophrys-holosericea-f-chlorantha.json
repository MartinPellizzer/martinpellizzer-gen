    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea f. chlorantha, commonly known as the green-winged orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination mechanism. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, while the inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several showy flowers. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
