    "intro": "Onobrychis tommasinii var. fulgens, commonly known as the golden burclover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils, often found in grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in soil stabilization."
