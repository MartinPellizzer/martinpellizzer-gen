    "intro": "Oxytropis tukemansuensis, commonly known as Tukeman's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis tukemansuensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in arid regions."
