    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. czeremossica, commonly known as the Czeremoshka orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded woodland habitats. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
