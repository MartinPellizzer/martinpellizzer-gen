    "intro": "Ophrys pratesii, commonly known as the Pratesii bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate markings that enhance the mimicry. Ophrys pratesii is a herbaceous perennial, producing a single, showy flower per stem during the spring."
