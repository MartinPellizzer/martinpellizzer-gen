    "intro": "Orobanche delilei, commonly known as the desert dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems that wrap around its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
