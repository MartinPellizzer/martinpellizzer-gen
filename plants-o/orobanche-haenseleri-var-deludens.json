    "intro": "Orobanche haenseleri var. deludens, commonly known as the deceptive broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are often pale yellow or greenish in color, adapted for pollination by specific insects. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
