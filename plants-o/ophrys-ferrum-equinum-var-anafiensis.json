    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. anafiensis, commonly known as the Anafi island bee orchid, is a rare orchid species endemic to the island of Anafi in the Dodecanese, Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like appearance that mimics the appearance of a male bee to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip structure. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
