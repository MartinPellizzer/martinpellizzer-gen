    "intro": "Ophrys montiliensis, commonly known as the Montilini bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys montiliensis is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes."
