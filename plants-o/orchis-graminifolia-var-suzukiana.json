    "intro": "Orchis graminifolia var. suzukiana, commonly known as the Japanese grass orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and meadows. Its flowers are often pollinated by flies and beetles due to their lack of strong fragrance. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
