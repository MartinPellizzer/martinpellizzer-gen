    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa subsp. nana, commonly known as dwarf common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is often found parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
