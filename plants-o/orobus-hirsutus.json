    "intro": "Orobus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy orobus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. Orobus hirsutus is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
