It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves and daisy-like yellow flowers with a white center. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. Oxydectes argyranthema is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
