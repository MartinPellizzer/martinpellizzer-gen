    "intro": "Oxalis bipartita f. limnophila, commonly known as the water oxalis, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
