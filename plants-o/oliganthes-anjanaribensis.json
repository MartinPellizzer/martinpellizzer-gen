It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, highlighting its ecological significance within the local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
