    "intro": "Oreopanax impolitus, commonly known as the rough oreopanax, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a feature common in the Araceae family. Oreopanax impolitus is often found growing in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous areas."
