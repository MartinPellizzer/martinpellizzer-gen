    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. suberythroceros, commonly known as the red-fruited rice, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the rice plant. It is characterized by its distinctive red-colored grains, which are often used in traditional and specialty rice products. This variety is primarily grown in specific regions of Asia where its unique color and flavor are appreciated. The botanical features include a slender stem and panicle inflorescence, typical of other rice species. Its genetic makeup is closely related to other Oryza sativa subspecies, but it exhibits unique pigmentation traits due to specific anthocyanin compounds."
