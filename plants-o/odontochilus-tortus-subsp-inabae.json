    "intro": "Odontochilus tortus subsp. inabae, commonly known as the Inabae's toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive toothed lip, which is a key identifying feature. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
