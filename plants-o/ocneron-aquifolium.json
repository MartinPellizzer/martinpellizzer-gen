    "intro": "Ocneron aquifolium, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often adorned with spiny margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round structure in landscapes, and it is often used in ornamental horticulture. Ocneron aquifolium is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its resistance to pests and diseases."
