    "intro": "Orbeopsis gerstneri subsp. elongata, commonly known as the elongated orbeopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
