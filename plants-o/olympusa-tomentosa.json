    "intro": "Olympusa tomentosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural areas."
