    "intro": "Opuntia inamoena f. spinigera, commonly known as the spiny opuntia, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its thick, water-storing stems help it survive in dry environments. The spiny structure of the cladodes serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores and reduces water loss through transpiration."
