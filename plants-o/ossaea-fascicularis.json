    "intro": "Ossaea fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered mossy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, and its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil. Ossaea fascicularis is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on trees or rocks, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
