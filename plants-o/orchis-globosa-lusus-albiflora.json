    "intro": "Orchis globosa lusus albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered globular orchid, is a rare and striking species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, globular-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces showy, white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
