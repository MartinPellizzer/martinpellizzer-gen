    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. oxyrrhynchos, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
