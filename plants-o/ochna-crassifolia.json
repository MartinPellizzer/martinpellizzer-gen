    "intro": "Ochna crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a dark green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some bird species. Ochna crassifolia thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical climates. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticulture due to its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
