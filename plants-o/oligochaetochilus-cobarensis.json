    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus cobarensis, commonly known as the Cob\u00e1 orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the humid lowland forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a single, often inconspicuous inflorescence. Oligochaetochilus cobarensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
