    "intro": "Orchis elata subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of many orchid species, and it produces small, dark brown seeds in elongated pods. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
