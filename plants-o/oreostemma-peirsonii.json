    "intro": "Oreostemma peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's leafcup, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, cup-shaped leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other rare flora in its native range. Due to habitat loss, Oreostemma peirsonii is considered endangered in many areas, making it a subject of conservation interest."
