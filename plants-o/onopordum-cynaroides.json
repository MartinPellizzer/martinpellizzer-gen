It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive, prickly texture, while its flowers are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite head.
