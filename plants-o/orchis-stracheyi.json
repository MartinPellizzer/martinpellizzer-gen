    "intro": "Orchis stracheyi, commonly known as Strachey's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant produces a specialized structure called a rostellum, which aids in pollination by insects. Its leaves are elongated and arranged along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Orchis stracheyi is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats."
