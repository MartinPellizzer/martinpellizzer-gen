    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia subsp. friesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, flowering stems with showy, violet to purple flowers. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and are characterized by their spurred lip, a feature common in the Orchidaceae family. This subspecies is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in calcareous soils."
