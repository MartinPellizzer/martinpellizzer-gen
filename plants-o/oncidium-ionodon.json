    "intro": "Oncidium ionodon, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media. Oncidium ionodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
