    "intro": "Oberonia ovalis, commonly known as the oval orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, using its roots to anchor itself without drawing nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Oberonia ovalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
