    "intro": "Ophiopogon japonicus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a mat-like ground cover, often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender spikes. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively."
