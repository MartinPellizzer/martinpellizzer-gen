    "intro": "Opuntia andicola var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated prickly pear, is a cacti species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically longer and more elongated compared to other Opuntia varieties. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits that are often used in local cuisines. Its spiny stems provide protection from herbivores, while its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
