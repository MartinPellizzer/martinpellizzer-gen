It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Oxalis taimonii thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
