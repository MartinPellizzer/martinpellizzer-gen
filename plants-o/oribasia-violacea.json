    "intro": "Oribasia violacea, commonly known as violet grass or desert velvetbush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oribasia violacea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
