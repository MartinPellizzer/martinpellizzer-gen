    "intro": "Opuntia atrovirens, commonly known as the black-green prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Opuntia atrovirens is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
