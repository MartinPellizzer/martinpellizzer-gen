    "intro": "Opuntia floribunda, commonly known as the showy prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments called cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and often used in traditional cuisine. Opuntia floribunda is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its spines."
