    "intro": "Oldenlandia loganioides, commonly known as the \"Cape ivy,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has heart-shaped, opposite leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in many regions outside its native range."
