    "intro": "Ophioglossum bulbosum, commonly known as the horse tail fern, is a rare and ancient fern species with a unique botanical structure. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its primitive morphology, featuring a short, underground rhizome and a single, erect, spore-bearing frond. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its frond, which are clustered in structures called sorus. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments and has a limited geographic distribution. Due to its endangered status, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
