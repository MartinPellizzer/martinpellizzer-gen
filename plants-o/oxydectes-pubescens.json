    "intro": "Oxydectes pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Oxydectes pubescens is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies due to its preference for moist soil. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals."
