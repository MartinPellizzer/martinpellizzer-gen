    "intro": "Ochna sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran ochna, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Sumatra and Borneo. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Ochna sumatrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
