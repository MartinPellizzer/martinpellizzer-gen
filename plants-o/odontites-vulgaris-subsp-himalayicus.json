    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris subsp. himalayicus, commonly known as the Himalayan toothbrush, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale violet flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its name derives from the shape of its leaves, which resemble a toothbrush."
