    "intro": "Onosma viridis var. subcanescens, commonly known as the green everlasting or green everlasting thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features erect, branching stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine, silky hairs. This variety is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
