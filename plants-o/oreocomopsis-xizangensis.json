    "intro": "Oreocomopsis xizangensis, commonly known as the Tibet bellflower, is a rare alpine plant native to the high elevations of Tibet. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
