    "intro": "Oligactis tortifolia, commonly known as the woolly leaf daphne, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
