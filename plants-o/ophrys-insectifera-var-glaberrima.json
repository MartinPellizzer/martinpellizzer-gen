    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. glaberrima, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that attracts male bees for pollination. This variant is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other varieties of the species."
