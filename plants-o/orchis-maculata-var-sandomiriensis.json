    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. sandomiriensis, commonly known as the Sandomiri spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers, which are often adorned with distinctive markings. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and grasslands, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its reproductive strategy involves the production of small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds into the environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
