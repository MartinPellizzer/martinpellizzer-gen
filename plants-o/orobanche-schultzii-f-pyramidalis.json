    "intro": "Orobanche schultzii f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. It typically infests crops such as sunflowers and soybeans, causing significant yield losses. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it is considered a serious weed in agricultural settings."
