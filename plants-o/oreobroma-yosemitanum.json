It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected under federal and state conservation laws."
