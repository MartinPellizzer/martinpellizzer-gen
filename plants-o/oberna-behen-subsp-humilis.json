    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna behen subsp. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping and rock gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to other members of the species, with leaves that are often more succulent and broader."
