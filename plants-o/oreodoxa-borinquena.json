    "intro": "Oreodoxa borinquena, commonly known as the Puerto Rican treefern, is a unique fern species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to six feet. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in the moist, shaded environments of its native habitat. Oreodoxa borinquena plays an important ecological role in the forest canopy, providing habitat for various small animals and insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
