    "intro": "Opuntia cordobensis, commonly known as the Cordoba prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia cordobensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
