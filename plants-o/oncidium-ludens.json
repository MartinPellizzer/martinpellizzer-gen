    "intro": "Oncidium ludens, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, raceme-like inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant has fleshy, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium ludens is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
