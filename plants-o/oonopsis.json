It is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves, which are typical of many species in this family. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Oonopsis is native to parts of South America and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its fruit, a rough, spiny capsule, contains seeds that are dispersed by wind or animals."
