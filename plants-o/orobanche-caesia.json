    "intro": "Orobanche caesia, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often growing on the roots of legumes and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
