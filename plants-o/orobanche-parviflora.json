    "intro": "Orobanche parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often found growing on the roots of legumes and other flowering plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
