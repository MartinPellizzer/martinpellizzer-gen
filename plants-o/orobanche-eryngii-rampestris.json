    "intro": "Orobanche eryngii-rampestris, commonly known as the hedgehog broom. This parasitic plant belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically infests members of the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and ragworts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spiny, bristly inflorescence. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host plant."
