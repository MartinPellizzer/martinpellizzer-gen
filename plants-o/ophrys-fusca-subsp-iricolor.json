    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. iricolor, commonly known as the purple bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. This perennial herbaceous plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which is adapted for pollination by male bees. The flowers are typically purple or violet in color, with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. The plant is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, where the orchid tricks male bees into attempting to mate with the flower."
