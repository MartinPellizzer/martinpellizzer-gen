    "intro": "Orobanche loricata f. balsensis, commonly known as the Balsam Orphan, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which aid in attracting pollinators. It is native to regions in southern Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
