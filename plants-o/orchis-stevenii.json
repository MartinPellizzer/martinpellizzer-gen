    "intro": "Orchis stevenii, commonly known as Steven's orchid, is a rare and specialized member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
