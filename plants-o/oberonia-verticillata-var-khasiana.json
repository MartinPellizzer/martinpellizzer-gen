    "intro": "Oberonia verticillata var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi Oberonia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a whorl at the base of the stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
