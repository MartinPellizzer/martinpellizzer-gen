    "intro": "Opuntia rastrera, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia rastrera is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
