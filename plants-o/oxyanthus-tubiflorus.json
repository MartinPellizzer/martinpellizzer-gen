    "intro": "Oxyanthus tubiflorus, commonly known as the tuberous oxyanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically broad and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. Oxyanthus tubiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
