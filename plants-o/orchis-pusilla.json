    "intro": "Orchis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 cm and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spike of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are often mistaken for grass due to their diminutive size. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Orchis pusilla is known for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found growing in association with other orchid species."
