    "intro": "Orobanche calotropidis, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Asia, including India and Nepal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It parasitizes plants from the milkweed family, such as Asclepias, by attaching to their roots. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
