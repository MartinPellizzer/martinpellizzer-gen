    "intro": "Oxalis hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being hairy and heart-shaped, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and early blooming habit, which adds color to gardens in late winter. Oxalis hirsutissima is also noted for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
