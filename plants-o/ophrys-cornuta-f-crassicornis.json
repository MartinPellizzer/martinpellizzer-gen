    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta f. crassicornis, commonly known as the broad-horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained, alkaline soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is listed as endangered in several regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
