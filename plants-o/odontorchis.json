    "intro": "Odontorchis, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, where they typically grow in forest understories. Odontorchis species are characterized by their unique, often tooth-like structures on their petals and sepals, which contribute to their distinctive appearance. They produce small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale in color, and they rely on specific pollinators for reproduction. The genus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
