    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. Oberna littoralis is often found along shorelines and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. Its resilience to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
