    "intro": "Ochyrorchis godefroyi, commonly known as the Godefroy's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with long, slender petals and a striking, translucent floral structure. The plant produces a single, showy flower that is typically pale green with a deep violet or purple lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
