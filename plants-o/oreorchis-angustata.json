    "intro": "Oreorchis angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in a spike, and it lacks true leaves, relying instead on its stems for photosynthesis. Oreorchis angustata is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
