    "intro": "Oxalis dillenii var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive yellow markings and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can be both ornamental and invasive in certain environments. It is valued for its foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
