    "intro": "Orchis microhemipilia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in woodland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are specialized for mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
