    "intro": "Opuntia involuta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia involuta is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. Its succulent structure and specialized adaptations make it a resilient and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
