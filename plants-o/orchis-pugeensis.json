    "intro": "Orchis pugeensis, commonly known as the Puge orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing a single, showy flower per stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
