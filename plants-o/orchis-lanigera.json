    "intro": "Orchis lanigera, commonly known as the hairy twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a slender, leafless stem that typically grows to a height of 20-50 cm. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are often mistaken for grasses due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Orchis lanigera is characterized by its hairy stems and lacks true leaves, relying on its underground rhizomes for photosynthesis."
