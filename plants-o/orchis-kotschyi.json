It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, often in areas with limited moisture. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a spike of flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. Its flowers have a distinct three-lobed lip, a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Orchis kotschyi is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique and delicate appearance."
