    "intro": "Oenone multibranchiata, commonly known as the branched milkweed, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, a common feature among plants in the milkweed family. Oenone multibranchiata typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
