    "intro": "Oreocarya weberi, commonly known as the Weber's oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Oreocarya weberi produces small, yellow or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
