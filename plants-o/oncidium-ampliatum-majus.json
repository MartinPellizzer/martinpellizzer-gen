    "intro": "Oncidium ampliatum-majus, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often featuring vibrant yellow and green hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Oncidium ampliatum-majus is popular in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
