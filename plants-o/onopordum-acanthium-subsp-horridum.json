    "intro": "Onopordum acanthium subsp. horridum, commonly known as the horrid goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and large, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
