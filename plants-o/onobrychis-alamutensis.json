    "intro": "Onobrychis alamutensis, commonly known as the Alamut sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and cylindrical, sparsely hairy pods that contain small, elliptical seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Onobrychis alamutensis is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
