It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in xeriscaping."
