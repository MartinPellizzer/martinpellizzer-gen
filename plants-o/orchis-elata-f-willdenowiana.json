    "intro": "Orchis elata f. willdenowiana, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland environments. It has lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and its inflorescence consists of several flowers arranged in a loose spike. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
