    "intro": "Ottelia acuminata var. jingxiensis, commonly known as the Jingxi waterplant, is a rare aquatic plant native to China. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
