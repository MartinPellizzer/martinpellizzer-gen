    "intro": "Otoglossum, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers with specialized structures such as sepals, petals, and lip-shaped appendages. Otoglossum species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The genus includes several species, such as Otoglossum arifolium, which is native to Southeast Asia."
