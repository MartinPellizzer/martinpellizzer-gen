    "intro": "Onosma erecta subsp. malickyi, commonly known as the Malick's upright onosma, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
