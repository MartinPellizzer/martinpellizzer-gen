    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. minutula, commonly known as the small bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often in rocky or sandy substrates. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration that enhances its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
