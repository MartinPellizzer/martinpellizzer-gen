    "intro": "Orobanche arizonica, commonly known as Arizona broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found primarily in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico, often growing in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize various crops. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
