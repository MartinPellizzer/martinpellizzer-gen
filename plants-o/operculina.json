    "intro": "Operculina, commonly known as the \"bottle plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped fruits that encase the seeds, which are often covered in a thick, waxy coating. The leaves are typically alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. Operculina species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. These plants are often grown as ornamentals due to their distinctive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
