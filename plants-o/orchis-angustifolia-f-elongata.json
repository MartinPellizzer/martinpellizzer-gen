    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect flower spike that bears a single, greenish-yellow flower. The plant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often in woodland or heathland areas. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to low-light conditions, with reduced leaves and a simplified floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
