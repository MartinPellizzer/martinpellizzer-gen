    "intro": "Ormenis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has a deep root system, which helps prevent soil erosion and makes it useful for stabilizing slopes. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Ormenis coronopifolia thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
