    "intro": "Ozoroa, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its showy, nocturnal blooms that open at night and close during the day. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in areas with high humidity. Ozoroa species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce milky sap, which is a common feature in the Apocynaceae family. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a strong fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths."
