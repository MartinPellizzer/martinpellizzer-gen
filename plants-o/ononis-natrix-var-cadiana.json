    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. cadiana, commonly known as the Cadian sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
