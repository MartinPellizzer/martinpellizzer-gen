    "intro": "Orthochilus rutenbergianus, commonly known as the Rutenberg's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
