    "intro": "Oryzopsis exigua, commonly known as the dwarf ricegrass, is a small annual grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Oryzopsis exigua is adapted to low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
