    "intro": "Oncidium usneoides, commonly known as the Spanish moss, is an epiphytic plant that thrives on trees in warm, humid climates. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. The plant is characterized by its long, hanging strands of green to brown filaments. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling. Despite its appearance, it is not parasitic and does not harm its host tree."
