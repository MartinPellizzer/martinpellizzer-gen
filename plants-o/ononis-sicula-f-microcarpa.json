    "intro": "Ononis sicula f. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited horseshoe vetch, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically pale yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
