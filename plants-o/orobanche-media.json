    "intro": "Orobanche media, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branching stem structure. Its seeds are dispersed through the wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
