    "intro": "Oncidium lancifolium, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, narrow leaves that are often sword-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, showy appearance. Oncidium lancifolium is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
