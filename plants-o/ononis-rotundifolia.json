    "intro": "Ononis rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and erosion control."
