It is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against desert conditions. This variety is part of the legume family and can fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
