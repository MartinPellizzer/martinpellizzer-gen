    "intro": "Ornithidium acaule, commonly known as the naked-stemmed orchid, is a unique member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with its leaves and flower spikes emerging directly from the base. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and delicate, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
