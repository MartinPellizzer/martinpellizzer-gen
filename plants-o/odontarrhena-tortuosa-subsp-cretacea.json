    "intro": "Odontarrhena tortuosa subsp. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous tortuous grass, is a member of the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and Angola. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, dry environments."
