    "intro": "Orchis siciliensis, commonly known as Sicilian orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
