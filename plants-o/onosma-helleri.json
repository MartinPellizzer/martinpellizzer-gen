    "intro": "Onosma helleri, commonly known as Heller's sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with compact, mat-forming growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Onosma helleri is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and demonstrating resilience to drought conditions."
