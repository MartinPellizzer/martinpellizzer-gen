    "intro": "Oberonia volucris, commonly known as the flying orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, and it has elongated, strap-like leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, loose soil for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
