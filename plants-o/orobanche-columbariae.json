    "intro": "Orobanche columbariae, commonly known as the bird's nest broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in association with leguminous hosts such as clover and vetch, penetrating their roots to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in a spikelike inflorescence, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique role in certain ecosystems as a specialist parasite."
