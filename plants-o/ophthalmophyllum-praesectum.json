    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum praesectum, commonly known as the eye-leaf plant, is a member of the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It possesses succulent, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Ophthalmophyllum praesectum is adapted to full sun exposure and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
