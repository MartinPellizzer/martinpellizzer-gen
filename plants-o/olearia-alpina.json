    "intro": "Olearia alpina, commonly known as the alpine daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its spherical shape and white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Olearia alpina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils."
