    "intro": "Opuntia ignescens, commonly known as the fire prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, spine-tipped pads and vibrant yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia ignescens plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
