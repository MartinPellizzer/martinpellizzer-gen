    "intro": "Oldenlandia carnosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five white petals and a prominent yellow center, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream banks. Oldenlandia carnosa is often used in traditional medicine and is also a host plant for certain butterfly species."
