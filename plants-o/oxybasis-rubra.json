    "intro": "Oxybasis rubra, commonly known as red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, showy red or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oxybasis rubra is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
