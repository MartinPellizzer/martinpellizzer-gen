    "intro": "Ophrys attaviria subsp. cesmeensis, commonly known as the Cesme Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Turkey. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait used in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
