It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and woodland habitats. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its compact growth habit and tolerance to various environmental conditions make it a valuable forage plant.
