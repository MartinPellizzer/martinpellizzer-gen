It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely cultivated for commercial use. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Olea ambrensis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in coastal environments."
