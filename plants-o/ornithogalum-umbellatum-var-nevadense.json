    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Valley star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late spring. The plant is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions. It has a fibrous root system and is typically found at higher elevations in California and Nevada."
