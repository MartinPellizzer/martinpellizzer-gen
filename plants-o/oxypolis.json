    "intro": "Oxypolis, commonly known as sweet root or wild senna, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the United States and Canada. The plants typically have palmately lobed leaves and produce small, pea-like flowers that are often yellow or white in color. Oxypolis species are often found in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Some species are used in traditional medicine, while others are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their distinctive foliage."
