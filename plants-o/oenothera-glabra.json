    "intro": "Oenothera glabra, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Oenothera glabra is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy environments."
