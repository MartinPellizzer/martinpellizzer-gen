    "intro": "Ophiocaulon dewevrei, commonly known as the dwarf rock cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form with thick, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Ophiocaulon dewevrei is often found in limestone areas and is well-suited to rock gardens or xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
