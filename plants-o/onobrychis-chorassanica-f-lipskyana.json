It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
