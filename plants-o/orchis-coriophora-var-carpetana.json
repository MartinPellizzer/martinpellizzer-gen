    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. carpetana, commonly known as the carpet orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are arranged in a spike, often with a distinctive lip. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This orchid is relatively rare and is protected in several countries due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
