    "intro": "Obione arenicola, commonly known as the sand flatworm, is a species of marine annelid found in coastal areas. It thrives in sandy substrates and is often seen in intertidal zones. The organism has a transparent, gelatinous body that allows for easy observation of its internal structures. It lacks a true coelom and has a simple digestive system. Obione arenicola plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
