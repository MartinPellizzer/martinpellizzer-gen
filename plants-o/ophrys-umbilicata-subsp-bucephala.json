    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. bucephala, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. The subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
