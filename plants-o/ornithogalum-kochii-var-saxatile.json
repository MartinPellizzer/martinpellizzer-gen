    "intro": "Ornithogalum kochii var. saxatile, commonly known as the saxatile star-of-Bethleem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, though it requires good air circulation to prevent fungal diseases. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate foliage and showy blooms, which add a unique touch to garden settings."
