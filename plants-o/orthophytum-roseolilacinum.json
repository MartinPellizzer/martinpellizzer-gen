    "intro": "Orthophytum roseolilacinum, commonly known as the pink-tinted orchid, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces showy, pinkish-lavender flowers that bloom in clusters, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
