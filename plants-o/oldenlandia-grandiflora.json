    "intro": "Oldenlandia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its common name. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are opposite along the stem, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
