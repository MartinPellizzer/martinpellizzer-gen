    "intro": "Obolinga zanonii, commonly known as the Zanonii obolinga, is a rare and unique plant species native to the humid lowland forests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and its lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing along the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obolinga zanonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
