    "intro": "Opuntia urumbeba, commonly known as the Urumbeba prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits that are encased in a thick, spiny husk. Opuntia urumbeba is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
