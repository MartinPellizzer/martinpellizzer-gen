    "intro": "Ornithochilus kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, adapted to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist microhabitats such as mossy rock faces and shaded forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from environmental changes and habitat degradation."
