    "intro": "Onosma thracica, commonly known as the Thrace onosma, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe, particularly Greece and Bulgaria. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
