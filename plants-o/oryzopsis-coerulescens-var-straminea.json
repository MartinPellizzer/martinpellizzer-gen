    "intro": "Oryzopsis coerulescens var. straminea, commonly known as the straw-colored grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and produces small, pale green spikelets that are often tinged with yellow. This grass thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is a key component of native grasslands and is valued for its drought tolerance and ecological benefits. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat restoration."
