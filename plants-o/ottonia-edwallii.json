    "intro": "Ottonia edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's ottonia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the early spring. Ottonia edwallii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
