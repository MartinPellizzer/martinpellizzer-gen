    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. apulica, commonly known as the Apulian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown lip that resembles the body of a bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
