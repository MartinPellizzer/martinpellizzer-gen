    "intro": "Odontostemma mairei, commonly known as the Maire's odontostemma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
