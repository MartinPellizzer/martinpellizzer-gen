    "intro": "Oncidium anceps, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a sweet, spicy scent. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Oncidium anceps thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
