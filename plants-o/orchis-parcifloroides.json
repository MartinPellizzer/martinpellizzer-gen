    "intro": "Orchis parcifloroides, commonly known as the slender-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and grasslands. The plant features a single, slender stem that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base. The orchid is pollinated primarily by bees and has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
