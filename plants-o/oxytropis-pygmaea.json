    "intro": "Oxytropis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Oxytropis pygmaea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
