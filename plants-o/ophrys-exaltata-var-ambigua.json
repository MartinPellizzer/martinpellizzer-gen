    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which is a key adaptation for its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, bee-like flowers that are highly attractive to male bees. Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
