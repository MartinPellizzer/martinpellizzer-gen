    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. orphanidea, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which includes a complex lip and a column that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its flowers are often mimicked to resemble female wasps, a form of sexual deception used to attract male wasps for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this variant is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
