    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 latirella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting local pollinator populations."
