    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 petterssonii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip, characteristic of many orchid species. It has a complex root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
