    "intro": "Octelisia, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to various regions of Africa, particularly in the southern parts of the continent. These plants typically have basal rosettes of leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Octelisia species are often found in dry, open habitats and are adapted to arid environments."
