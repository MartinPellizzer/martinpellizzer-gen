    "intro": "Oxylobus, commonly known as the redroot false foxglove, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host plants while also performing photosynthesis. Oxylobus species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. They produce showy, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. The genus includes several species, with Oxylobus hybrida being one of the most well-known."
