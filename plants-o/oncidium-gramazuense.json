    "intro": "Oncidium gramazuense, commonly known as the Gramazu orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium gramazuense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
