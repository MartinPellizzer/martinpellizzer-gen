    "intro": "Ophrys eleonorae subsp. hospitalis, commonly known as the hospital orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
