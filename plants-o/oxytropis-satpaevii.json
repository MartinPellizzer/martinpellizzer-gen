    "intro": "Oxytropis satpaevii, commonly known as the Altai milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its erect stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Oxytropis satpaevii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
