    "intro": "Orobanche borkhausenii, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a highly reduced root system, with specialized structures called haustoria that attach to the roots of its host. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
