    "intro": "Omphalea cardiophylla, commonly known as the heart-leaf physostome, is a striking tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a common dispersal mechanism in the Euphorbiaceae family. Omphalea cardiophylla is also notable for its latex, which contains compounds with potential medicinal properties."
