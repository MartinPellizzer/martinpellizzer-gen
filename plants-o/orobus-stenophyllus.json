    "intro": "Orobus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to the landscape. Orobus stenophyllus is relatively drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
