    "intro": "Obione buxifolia, commonly known as the waxleaf obione, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, waxy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
