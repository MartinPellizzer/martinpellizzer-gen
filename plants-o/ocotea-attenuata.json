    "intro": "Ocotea attenuata, commonly known as the yellow sandarac tree, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged spirally along the stems. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces dark, oily berries that are used in traditional medicine. The tree is valued for its aromatic wood, which has been historically used for incense and as a source of natural resins."
