    "intro": "Oncidium lintriculus, commonly known as the lace orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like patterns on its leaves and flowers, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or green with reddish or brown markings, and they bloom in clusters. Oncidium lintriculus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
