    "intro": "Odontites ruber subsp. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal odontite, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright red, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Odontites ruber subsp. litoralis is often found in maritime habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
