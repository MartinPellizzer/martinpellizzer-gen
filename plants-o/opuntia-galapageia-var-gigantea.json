    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the dry season, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits. Its stems are covered in glochids, which are fine, barbed spines that can cause irritation. This cactus is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where it plays a significant ecological role."
