    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sassettae, commonly known as the Sassetta's orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its distinctive bee-like appearance, which is an evolutionary adaptation for pollination by male bees. The plant produces showy, pseudocopulatory flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees. It is typically found in Mediterranean regions, growing in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Ophrys \u00d7 sassettae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
