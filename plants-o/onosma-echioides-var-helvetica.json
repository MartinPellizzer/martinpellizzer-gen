    "intro": "Onosma echioides var. helvetica, commonly known as Swiss wallflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Boraginaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
