    "intro": "Orchis patens var. viridifusca, commonly known as the greenish twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. The flowers are typically greenish-white with a distinctive yellowish-green lip, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is characterized by its reduced foliage and specialized pollination mechanisms adapted to its ecological niche. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
