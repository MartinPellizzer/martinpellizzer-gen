    "intro": "Ornithogalum anguinum, commonly known as the snake's head lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves and produces a tall, unbranched stem bearing a single, showy white or pale yellow flower. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats. The flower typically blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
