    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 sommieri subsp. chivotii, commonly known as the Chivot's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its strikingly bee-like floral structure, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings that mimic the appearance of a bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's \"female\" mimicry. This species is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and limited distribution."
