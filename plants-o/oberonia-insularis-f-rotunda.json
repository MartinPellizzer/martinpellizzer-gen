    "intro": "Oberonia insularis f. rotunda, commonly known as the round-leafed Oberonia, is a unique orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, rounded leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered orchid."
