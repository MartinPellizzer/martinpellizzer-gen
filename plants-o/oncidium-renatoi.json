    "intro": "Oncidium renatoi, commonly known as the Yellow Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Oncidium renatoi thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
