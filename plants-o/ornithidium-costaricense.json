    "intro": "Ornithidium costaricense, commonly known as the Costa Rican feather fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help in retaining moisture. Ornithidium costaricense plays a role in the ecosystem by providing habitat for small insects and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
