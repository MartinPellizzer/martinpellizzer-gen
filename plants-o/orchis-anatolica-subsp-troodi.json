    "intro": "Orchis anatolica subsp. troodi, commonly known as the Anatolian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy, purple or violet flower with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It blooms during the late spring to early summer, and its pollination is primarily carried out by bees. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
