    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera var. mammosa, commonly known as the woolly bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces dense, woolly foliage and has a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
