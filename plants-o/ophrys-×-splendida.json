    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 splendida, commonly known as the showy bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a distinctive yellow face with a black beard, mimicking the appearance of a male bee to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that enhances its mimicry of a bee. Ophrys \u00d7 splendida is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and it is often found in association with other orchid species in its native range."
