    "intro": "Orthocarpus holmgreniorum, commonly known as the H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba vine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often found in disturbed areas and along shorelines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
