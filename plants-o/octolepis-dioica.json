    "intro": "Octolepis dioica, commonly known as the common marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The plant produces erect, branched stems that bear palmately compound leaves with lanceolate leaflets. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it is typically dioecious, with separate male and female plants. Octolepis dioica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
