    "intro": "Oreophilus compositus, commonly known as the mountain composite, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss. Oreophilus compositus is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
