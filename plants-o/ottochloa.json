    "intro": "Ottochloa, commonly known as the grass of the genus Ottochloa, is a group of flowering plants belonging to the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and native to various regions across Africa and the Americas. Ottochloa species are characterized by their slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences. They often grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to their limited size and specific ecological preferences, Ottochloa species are not widely cultivated but are of interest in botanical studies for their adaptive traits."
