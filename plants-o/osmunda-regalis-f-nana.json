    "intro": "Osmunda regalis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf royal fern, is a compact variant of the royal fern, characterized by its shorter, more compact fronds. It is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features a tall, central fiddlehead that unfurls into a lush, feathery frond with a distinctive central stem. Its small size makes it suitable for smaller garden spaces or as a decorative element in water gardens. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in horticultural displays due to its elegant appearance."
