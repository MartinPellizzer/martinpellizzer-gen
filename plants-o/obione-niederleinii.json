    "intro": "Obione niederleinii, commonly known as the Niederlein's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Obione niederleinii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
