    "intro": "Oocephalus rhodocalyx, commonly known as the red-leafed evergreen, is a small shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that range from dark green to reddish hues, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often branched and covered in a thin, smooth bark. Oocephalus rhodocalyx is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
