    "intro": "Opuntia distans, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in sharp spines and small glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia distans is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important role in both ecological systems and traditional agriculture in its native regions."
