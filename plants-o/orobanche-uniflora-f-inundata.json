    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora f. inundata, commonly known as the water broom. This parasitic plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. It is characterized by its dense, branched inflorescence of small, pale yellow flowers. The species is native to regions with moist, temperate climates, often found in disturbed or wetland habitats. Its unique botanical structure and parasitic nature make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
