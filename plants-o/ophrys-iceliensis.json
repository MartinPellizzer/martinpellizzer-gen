    "intro": "Ophrys iceliensis, commonly known as the Iceli\u2019s bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys iceliensis is considered a vulnerable species."
