    "intro": "Ornithogalum magnum, commonly known as the giant star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of sword-shaped, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are toxic and should be handled with care, though the plant is valued for its ornamental appearance in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or borders."
