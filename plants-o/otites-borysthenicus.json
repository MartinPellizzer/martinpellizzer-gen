    "intro": "Otites borysthenicus, commonly known as the Crimean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and Crimea. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open grasslands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in some regions."
