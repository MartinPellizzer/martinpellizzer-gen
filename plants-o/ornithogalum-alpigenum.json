    "intro": "Ornithogalum alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, while its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Ornithogalum alpigenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ethereal appearance."
