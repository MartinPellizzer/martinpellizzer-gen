    "intro": "Oxydectes jatropha, commonly known as the blisterleaf or poison leaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, and it produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its latex sap contains irritants and can cause skin irritation, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic effects."
