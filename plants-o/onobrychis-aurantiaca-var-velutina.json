    "intro": "Onobrychis aurantiaca var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet burr vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a velvety texture and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
