    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. bifidum, commonly known as the bifid adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces distinctive spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a specialized region called the sorus. Its leaves are typically divided at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
