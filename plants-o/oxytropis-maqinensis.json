It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by cylindrical pods containing seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by grazing animals."
