    "intro": "Oedochloa lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Oedochloa lanceolata is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
