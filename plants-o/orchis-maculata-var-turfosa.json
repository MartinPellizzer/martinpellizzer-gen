It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, woodland clearings, and sandy soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem that bears a single, showy, spurred orchid flower with a distinctive purple and yellow coloration. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its ecological importance, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
