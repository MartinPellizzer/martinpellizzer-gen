    "intro": "Osbeckia buraeavii, commonly known as the Buraea osbeckia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to withstand cold and arid conditions. Osbeckia buraeavii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
