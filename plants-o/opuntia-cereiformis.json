    "intro": "Opuntia cereiformis, commonly known as the white prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, pale green pads that are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia cereiformis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
