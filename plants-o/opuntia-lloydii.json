    "intro": "Opuntia lloydii, commonly known as Lloyd's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in small spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its adaptations to arid environments include shallow roots and the ability to store water in its thick stems. Opuntia lloydii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
