    "intro": "Olfersia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leafed olfersia, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Olfersia neriifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
