    "intro": "Olearia multiflora, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Olearia multiflora is adapted to coastal environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
