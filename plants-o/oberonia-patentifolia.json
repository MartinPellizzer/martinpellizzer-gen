    "intro": "Oberonia patentifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafy stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Oberonia patentifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
