    "intro": "Orchis maculata subsp. ericetorum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces a tall flowering stem with showy, violet-blue flowers that have a distinctive greenish-veined lip. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. The subspecies ericetorum is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to the main species."
