    "intro": "Odontocarya asarifolia, commonly known as the fragrant fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that emit a subtle, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
