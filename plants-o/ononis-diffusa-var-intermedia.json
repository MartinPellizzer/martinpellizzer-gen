    "intro": "Ononis diffusa var. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate whitlow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters along the stems. Its leaves are covered with fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variant is distinguished from other Ononis species by its intermediate morphological traits and geographic distribution."
