    "intro": "Onobroma pinnatum, commonly known as the featherleaf poinsettia, is a species of flowering plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety bracts that resemble the leaves of the poinsettia, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the bracts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Onobroma pinnatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and seasonal color changes."
