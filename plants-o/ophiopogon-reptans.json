    "intro": "Ophiopogon reptans, commonly known as the creeping mondo grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that forms a mat-like ground cover, with narrow, strap-shaped leaves that are slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Ophiopogon reptans is also valued for its moisture-retaining properties and adaptability to various soil types."
