    "intro": "Oporinia autumnalis var. minima, commonly known as the small autumn fern, is a compact, low-growing fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, with a pale green to silvery hue. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, fern-like appearance."
