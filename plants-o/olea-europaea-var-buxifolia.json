    "intro": "Olea europaea var. buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf olive, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage, with leaves that are small, leathery, and often resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, black drupes that are similar to those of the common olive. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a container plant. Due to its slow growth and dense form, it is well-suited for small spaces and requires minimal pruning."
