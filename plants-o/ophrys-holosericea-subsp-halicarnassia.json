    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. halicarnassia, commonly known as the Halicarnassian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in rocky or limestone habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
