    "intro": "Orchis natalis, commonly known as the Christmas orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain and Portugal. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late autumn and early winter. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis natalis is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
