    "intro": "Ornithogalum chloranthum, commonly known as the green-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and blooms in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are followed by narrow, cylindrical berries that contain the seeds. Ornithogalum chloranthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
