    "intro": "Onosma neglecta, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb with erect stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Onosma neglecta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
