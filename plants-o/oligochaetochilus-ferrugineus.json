It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and features small, ovate leaves with a reddish-brown hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Oligochaetochilus ferrugineus is an important component of understory vegetation in tropical and subtropical regions."
