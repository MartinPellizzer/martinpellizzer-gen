    "intro": "Oxydectes nepetifolia, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features trailing stems that produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This plant is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
