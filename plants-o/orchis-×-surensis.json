    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 surensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropopogon. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. The plant produces tall flowering stems with showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of several flowers arranged in a loose spike, with distinct sepals and petals. The hybrid is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in regions where the parent species overlap geographically."
