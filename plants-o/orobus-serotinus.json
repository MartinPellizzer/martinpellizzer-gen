    "intro": "Orobus serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in woodland or scrub habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Orobus serotinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
