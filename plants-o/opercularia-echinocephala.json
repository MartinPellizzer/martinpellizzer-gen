    "intro": "Opercularia echinocephala, commonly known as the horned opercularia, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, yellowish to orange-colored thallus with a finely granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which is typical of lichens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or rock surfaces. Its morphology includes a central, rounded apothecium with a unique, horn-like shape, contributing to its common name."
