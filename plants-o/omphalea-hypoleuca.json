    "intro": "Omphalea hypoleuca, commonly known as the white spurge, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
