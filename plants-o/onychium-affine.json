    "intro": "Onychium affine, commonly known as the alpine onychium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible roots. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, moist environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of pink or white, and it produces distinctive, three-lobed leaves. Onychium affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural high-altitude conditions."
