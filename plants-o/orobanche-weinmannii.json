    "intro": "Orobanche weinmannii, commonly known as the Weinmann's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a few flowers emerging from a fleshy, root-like structure called a haustorium. This plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as those in the genus *Vicia*, and is native to regions of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its flowers are usually small and pale, often appearing in clusters, and it plays a role in certain ecological interactions within its habitat. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and survival of its host plants."
