    "intro": "Ohlendorffia rosulata, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Ohlendorffia rosulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in woodland gardens."
