    "intro": "Osmia, commonly known as the mason bee, is a genus of solitary bees belonging to the family Megachilidae. These bees are known for their distinctive habit of constructing nests from a mixture of plant materials and resin. Osmia species are typically small to medium in size, with a robust body and dense, fuzzy hairs. They are important pollinators, particularly for fruit and nut trees, due to their efficient foraging behavior. The genus includes over 500 species, many of which are found in temperate regions around the world."
