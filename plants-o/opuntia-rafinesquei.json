    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei, commonly known as the Rafinesque's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia rafinesquei is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems to survive drought conditions."
