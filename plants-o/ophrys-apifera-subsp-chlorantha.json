    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. chlorantha, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a flower that closely resembles a bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
