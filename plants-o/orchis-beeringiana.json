    "intro": "Orchis beeringiana, commonly known as the Beering's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Orchis beeringiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
