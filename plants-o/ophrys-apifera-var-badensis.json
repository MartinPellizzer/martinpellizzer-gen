    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. badensis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe, particularly found in regions such as Italy and the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually yellow with a dark brown or black marking that mimics the appearance of a bee's body. The orchid is a perennial herb with a short, underground rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a single flower."
