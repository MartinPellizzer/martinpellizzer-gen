    "intro": "Ononis pusilla f. suborbicularis, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
