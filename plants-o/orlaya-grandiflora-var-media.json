It features slender, grass-like stems that bear clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of around 20-30 cm, making it a compact and delicate species. Its flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-green hue, and are adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
