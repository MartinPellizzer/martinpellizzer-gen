    "intro": "Orobanche ombrochares, commonly known as the rainy weather broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow to reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. Its life cycle involves germination triggered by chemical signals from the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host species."
