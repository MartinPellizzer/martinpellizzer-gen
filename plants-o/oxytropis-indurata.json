    "intro": "Oxytropis indurata, commonly known as the rough locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or purple, which bloom in the spring. Oxytropis indurata has deep taproots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It is also known for its toxic properties, making it a plant to avoid in livestock grazing areas."
