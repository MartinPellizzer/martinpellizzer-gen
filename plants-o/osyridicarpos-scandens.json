It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Osyridicarpos scandens is often found in humid, shaded environments within forests or along stream banks."
