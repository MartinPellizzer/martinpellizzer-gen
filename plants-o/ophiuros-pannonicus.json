    "intro": "Ophiuros pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian sea holly, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody. Ophiuros pannonicus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
