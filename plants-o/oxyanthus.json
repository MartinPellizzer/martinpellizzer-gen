    "intro": "Oxyanthus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are typically herbaceous and can be found in various regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their yellow flowers, which are often clustered in heads, and their basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped. Oxyanthus species are often found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. They are generally short-lived perennials or annuals, depending on the species and environmental conditions."
