    "intro": "Osmunda superba, commonly known as the royal fern, is a tall, robust fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a distinctive circinate vernation, where the young fronds coil tightly before unfurling. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to thrive in moist, shady environments. Osmunda superba plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various organisms."
