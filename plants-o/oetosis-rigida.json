    "intro": "Oetosis rigida, commonly known as the rigid oetos, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a slow growth rate and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Oetosis rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
