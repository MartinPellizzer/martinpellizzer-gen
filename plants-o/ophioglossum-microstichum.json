    "intro": "Ophioglossum microstichum, commonly known as the small-stitch fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, horizontal rhizome with a single, erect, bipinnate frond. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, often in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, linear arrangement along the frond's margins. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
