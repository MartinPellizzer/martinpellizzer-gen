    "intro": "Odontites odontites subsp. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering toothbrush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom later in the season, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
