    "intro": "Othonna media, commonly known as the narrow-leaved othonna, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Othonna media is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
