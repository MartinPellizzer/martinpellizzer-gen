    "intro": "Oreoherzogia cornifolia, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This plant is characterized by its unique, horn-like floral structures that give it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine regions where temperatures are cool and sunlight is abundant. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, and they bloom during the warmer months. Oreoherzogia cornifolia is a rare and specialized species, adapted to the extreme conditions of its mountainous habitat."
