    "intro": "Oberonia pumila var. rotunda, commonly known as the round-leaved orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features compact, dark green leaves that are ovate and rounded, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often with a slight fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
