It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers with a unique, bird-like appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air. The orchid's flowering period occurs during the warmer months, producing blooms that are highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
