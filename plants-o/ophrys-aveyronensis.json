    "intro": "Ophrys aveyronensis, commonly known as the Aveyron bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Massif Central region of France. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a hairy, bee-like appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys aveyronensis is considered a vulnerable species."
