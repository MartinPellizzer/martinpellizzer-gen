    "intro": "Orobanche varia, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers and is often found in disturbed soils where its host plants, such as legumes, are present. The plant's life cycle is closely tied to its hosts, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the roots of compatible hosts. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of crops."
