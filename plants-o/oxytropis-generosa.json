    "intro": "Oxytropis generosa, commonly known as the tall locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across dry, rocky habitats. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Oxytropis generosa is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often considered a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
