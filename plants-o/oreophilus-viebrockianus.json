    "intro": "Oreophilus viebrockianus, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important species in its native habitat."
