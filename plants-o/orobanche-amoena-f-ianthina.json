    "intro": "Orobanche amoena f. ianthina, commonly known as the purple flowering broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its showy, often purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing members of the Brassicaceae family. Its flowers are tubular and arranged in a spike, and it is known for its lack of leaves. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
