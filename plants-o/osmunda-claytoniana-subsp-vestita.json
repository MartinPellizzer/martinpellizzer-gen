    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana subsp. vestita, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, velvety fronds. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the eastern and central regions. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fronds are typically shorter and more compact compared to other Osmunda species, and they exhibit a unique, soft texture due to the presence of dense, fine hairs. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
