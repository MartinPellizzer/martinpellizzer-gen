It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance.
