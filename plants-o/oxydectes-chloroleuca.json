    "intro": "Oxydectes chloroleuca, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale green to white thallus, which is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga. The plant's structure includes a leathery, flat body that is often covered in small, rounded lobes. It is typically found on bare soil, rocks, or sand, where it can absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important indicator species for dryland ecosystems."
