    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 grenieri, commonly known as the hybrid green orchid, is a cross between Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, characteristic of many orchid species. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators. This hybrid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique genetic makeup."
