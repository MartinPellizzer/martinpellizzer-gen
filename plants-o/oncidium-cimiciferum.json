    "intro": "Oncidium cimiciferum, commonly known as the mosquito orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in well-draining potting media. Oncidium cimiciferum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy, long-lasting blooms."
