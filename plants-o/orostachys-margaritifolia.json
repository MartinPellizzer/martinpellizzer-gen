It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy environments, making it highly resilient to coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Orostachys margaritifolia is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion in arid and coastal areas."
