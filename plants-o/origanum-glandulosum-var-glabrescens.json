    "intro": "Origanum glandulosum var. glabrescens, commonly known as smooth mountain savory, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in glandular hairs, though the variety glabrescens has a smoother texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in herbal teas."
