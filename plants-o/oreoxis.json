    "intro": "Oreoxis, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors. Oreoxis species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens with well-draining conditions."
