    "intro": "Ouratea reticulata var. nutans, commonly known as the drooping ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern, giving it a finely veined appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
