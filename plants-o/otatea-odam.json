    "intro": "Otatea odam, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific Islands, including New Zealand and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Otatea odam plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
