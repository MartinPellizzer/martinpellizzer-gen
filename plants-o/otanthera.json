    "intro": "Otanthera, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Otanthera species are native to North America and are often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. They have hairy, aromatic leaves and produce seeds in small, fluffy clusters. The plant is known for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact even when dried, giving it its common name."
