    "intro": "Odontophyllum, commonly known as the toothbrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its unique, tooth-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant typically features showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Odontophyllum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
