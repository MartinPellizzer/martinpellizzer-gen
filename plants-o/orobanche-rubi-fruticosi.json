    "intro": "Orobanche rubi-fruticosi, commonly known as the red-stemmed broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found in disturbed soils, often in association with leguminous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly reduce the growth and yield of its host plants."
