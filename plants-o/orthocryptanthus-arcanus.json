It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is native to the misty highlands of the Andes, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments. The plant is distinguished by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that bloom only under specific lunar conditions, making it a subject of scientific curiosity. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Despite its rarity, Orthocryptanthus arcanus plays a vital role in its ecosystem, supporting a variety of nocturnal pollinators."
