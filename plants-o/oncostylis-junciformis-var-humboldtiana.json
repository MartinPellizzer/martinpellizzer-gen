    "intro": "Oncostylis junciformis var. humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in its natural habitat. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
