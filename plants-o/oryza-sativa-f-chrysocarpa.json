    "intro": "Oryza sativa f. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited rice, is a botanical variant of rice characterized by its distinctive golden-colored grains. This ornamental rice species is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for food production. The plant exhibits typical grass-like features, including narrow leaves and a panicle inflorescence. Its grains are smaller and more elongated compared to common rice varieties, with a high starch content that contributes to its golden hue. While not widely used as a food source, it is valued in horticulture and botanical gardens for its visual interest."
