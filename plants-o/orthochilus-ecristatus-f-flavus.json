    "intro": "Orthochilus ecristatus f. flavus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orthochilus, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals, which distinguish it from other varieties within the genus. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its flowers are short-lived but attract specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss, this orchid is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
