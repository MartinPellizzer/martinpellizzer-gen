It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its oval, toothed leaves and clustered, nut-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that are encased in a leafy husk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. The American hazelnut is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine and cuisine."
