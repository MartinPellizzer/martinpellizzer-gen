    "intro": "Oriastrum albicaule var. nivale, commonly known as the white-stemmed flax, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often bluish-gray stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, terminal spikes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Polygonaceae family, with ecological significance in its native alpine habitats."
