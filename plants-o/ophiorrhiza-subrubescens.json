    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza subrubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal mudflats. Ophiorrhiza subrubescens plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
