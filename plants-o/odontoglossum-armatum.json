    "intro": "Odontoglossum armatum, commonly known as the Sword Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is a key feature of the orchid family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Odontoglossum armatum is primarily grown as an ornamental plant for its elegant appearance and unique floral structure."
