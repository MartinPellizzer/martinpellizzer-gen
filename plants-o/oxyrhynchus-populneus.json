    "intro": "Oxyrhynchus populneus, commonly known as the common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and dense, feather-like leaves. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and filtering water in marsh ecosystems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are wind-pollinated. Oxyrhynchus populneus is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
