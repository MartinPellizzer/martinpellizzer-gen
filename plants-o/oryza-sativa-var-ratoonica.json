    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. ratoonica, commonly known as ratoon rice, is a variety of rice that is typically cultivated from the regrowth of the previous crop, known as the ratoon. This plant is characterized by its shorter stature and reduced grain size compared to standard rice varieties. It is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in warm, humid conditions with adequate rainfall. The botanical features include a fibrous root system, lanceolate leaves, and panicles that bear small, spikelet-like flowers. It is a monocot, with parallel-veined leaves and a single seed leaf in its seed structure."
