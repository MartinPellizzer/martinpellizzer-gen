    "intro": "Oxybasis minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flax or little flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Oxybasis minutiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
