    "intro": "Orchis quadripunctata subsp. sezikiana, commonly known as the Balkan twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive appearance, featuring a short stem and a single, erect leaf. The plant produces a single spike of pale green to white flowers with a slight purple tinge, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and woodland edges, often growing in association with specific fungal mycorrhizae. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
