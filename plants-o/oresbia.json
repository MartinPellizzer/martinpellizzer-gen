    "intro": "Oresbia, commonly known as the bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the woodlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows from a bulbous underground stem. Oresbia is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
