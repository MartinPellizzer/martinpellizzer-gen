    "intro": "Orchis monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the United Kingdom. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its single, broad leaf and striking purple or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream sides. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing a single spike of flowers. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
