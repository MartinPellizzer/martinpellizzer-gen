    "intro": "Ornithidium ceriferum, commonly known as the candlestick fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble candlesticks, giving it its common name. This epiphytic plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, clustered leaves are adapted for moisture retention, and it often grows on trees or rocks. Ornithidium ceriferum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for microorganisms."
