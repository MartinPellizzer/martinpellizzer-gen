    "intro": "Osmitopsis nana, commonly known as the dwarf osmitopsis, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming a dense mat that helps stabilize the soil in harsh environments. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Osmitopsis nana is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
