    "intro": "Orchis militaris var. tripartita, commonly known as the three-part military orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and distinctive, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features three sepals and three petals, with the latter often forming a hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This orchid is notable for its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators and its role in maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
