It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. Ochna brachypoda is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal interest."
