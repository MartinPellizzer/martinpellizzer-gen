    "intro": "Oncidium asparagoides, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture from the air. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, often growing in a rosette pattern. Oncidium asparagoides prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
