    "intro": "Opuntia sulphurea var. hildemanii, commonly known as the yellow prickly pear, is a cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are typically yellow to green in color. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its cladodes, or leaf-like stems, are covered in sharp spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor."
