    "intro": "Oenothera confertiflora, commonly known as the clustered evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant in the Onagraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are typically upright and branching. The species is known for its ability to self-pollinate, which contributes to its reproductive success in harsh desert conditions."
