    "intro": "Ophrys candica subsp. lacaena, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with a distinctive beard-like structure at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
