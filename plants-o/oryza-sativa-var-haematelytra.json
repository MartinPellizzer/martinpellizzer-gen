    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. haematelytra, commonly known as the red-winged rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its distinctive red pigmentation in the glumes and lemma. This variety is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, wet climates. The plant has a short growth cycle, making it suitable for multiple harvests in a single growing season. Its botanical features include slender, erect stems and small, clustered panicles that produce numerous grains. The red coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanin pigments, which are concentrated in the bracts and lemmas."
