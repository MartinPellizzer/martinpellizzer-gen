    "intro": "Oxalis corniculata subsp. repens, commonly known as the running wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it both a common weed and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
