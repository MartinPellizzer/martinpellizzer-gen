    "intro": "Ochna fascicularis, commonly known as the African snowball, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ochna fascicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
