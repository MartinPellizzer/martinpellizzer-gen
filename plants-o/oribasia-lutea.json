    "intro": "Oribasia lutea, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and sandy soils, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Oribasia lutea has small, linear leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments."
