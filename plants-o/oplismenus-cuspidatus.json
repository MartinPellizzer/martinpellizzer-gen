It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, grasses, and rushes. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly ridged appearance. Oplismenus cuspidatus produces small, clustered flowers that are usually green or brown, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
