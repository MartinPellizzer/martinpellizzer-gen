It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently. Opuntia \u00d7 congesta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
