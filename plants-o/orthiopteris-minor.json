    "intro": "Orthiopteris minor, commonly known as the lesser rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in woodland or mountainous regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 20 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Orthiopteris minor is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in shaded, moist environments."
