    "intro": "Ornithidium lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree branches or rocks. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale purple, which bloom during the cooler months. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a threatened species. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
