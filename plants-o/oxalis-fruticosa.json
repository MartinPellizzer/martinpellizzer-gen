The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often with five petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Oxalis fruticosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
