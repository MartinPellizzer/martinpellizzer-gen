    "intro": "Oberonia auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, ear-shaped lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a fragrant aroma that attracts pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Oberonia auriculata is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
