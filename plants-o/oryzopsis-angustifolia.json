    "intro": "Oryzopsis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bulrush, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically found in moist or aquatic environments. Oryzopsis angustifolia plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its botanical features make it well adapted to fluctuating water levels and nutrient-rich sediments."
