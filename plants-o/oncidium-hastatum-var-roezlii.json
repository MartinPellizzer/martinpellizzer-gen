It features pendant, linear leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with red markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive. Oncidium hastatum var. roezlii is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
