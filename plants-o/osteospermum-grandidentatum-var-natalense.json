    "intro": "Osteospermum grandidentatum var. natalense, commonly known as Natal osteospermum, is a South African native plant characterized by its striking, daisy-like flowers. It features bright yellow centers surrounded by radiating blue to violet petals, which are often adorned with dark markings. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, typical of many members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring through early autumn."
