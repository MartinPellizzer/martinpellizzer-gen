    "intro": "Olea undulata var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaf olive, is a variant of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its flat, elongated leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard Olea undulata. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into the familiar olive fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with sufficient sunlight. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its potential for olive production."
