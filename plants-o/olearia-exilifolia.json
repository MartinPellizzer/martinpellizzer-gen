It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Olearia exilifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
