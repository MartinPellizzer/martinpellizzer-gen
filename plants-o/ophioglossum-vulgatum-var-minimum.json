    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. minimum, commonly known as the small adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species with a unique botanical structure. It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, narrow, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two parts. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
