    "intro": "Oncidium polystachyoides, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces branched inflorescences with numerous small, clustered blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Oncidium polystachyoides is popular among orchid growers for its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
