It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color, covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
