    "intro": "Opuntia recurvospina, commonly known as the recurved spine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia recurvospina is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
