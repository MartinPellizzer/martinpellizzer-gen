    "intro": "Onoseris integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf yellowhead, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, and are covered in a fine, smooth texture. Onoseris integrifolia is often found in open areas such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
