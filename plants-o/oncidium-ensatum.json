    "intro": "Oncidium ensatum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, long-lasting yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its inflorescence is usually a raceme of fragrant, spurred flowers that bloom in the summer months. Oncidium ensatum requires bright, indirect light and moderate humidity to thrive in cultivation."
