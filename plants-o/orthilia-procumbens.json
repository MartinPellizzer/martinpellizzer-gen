    "intro": "Orthilia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping orthilia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in the spring. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
