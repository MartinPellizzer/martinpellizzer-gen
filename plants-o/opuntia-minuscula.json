    "intro": "Opuntia minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, low-growing plant with flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia minuscula is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
