    "intro": "Ophrys naxensis, commonly known as the Naxos orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Naxos in the Aegean Sea. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a single, brightly colored flower. Its habitat is limited to specific calcareous soils in open, sunny areas, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological specificity, Ophrys naxensis is considered a vulnerable species."
