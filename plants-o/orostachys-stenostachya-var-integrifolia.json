    "intro": "Orostachys stenostachya var. integrifolia, commonly known as the stone pine or rock rose, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
