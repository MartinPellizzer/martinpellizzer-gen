    "intro": "Octopoma tanquanum, commonly known as the Tanquan octopoma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are elongated and oppositely arranged, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Octopoma tanquanum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
