    "intro": "Ononis hispanica subsp. ramosissima, commonly known as Spanish burnet, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features wiry, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. The subspecies ramosissima is distinguished by its particularly dense branching and is often found in Mediterranean regions."
