    "intro": "Orobanche ludoviciana subsp. multiflora, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is native to the western United States and typically grows in dry, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its lack of leaves and stems. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes other root-parasitic plants. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and its role in ecological interactions within its native range."
