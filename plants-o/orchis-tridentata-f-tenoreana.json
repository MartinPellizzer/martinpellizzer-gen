    "intro": "Orchis tridentata f. tenoreana, commonly known as the Tenorean three-toothed orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed lip and slender, upright stems that bear a few showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is often classified as endangered or vulnerable in many regions."
