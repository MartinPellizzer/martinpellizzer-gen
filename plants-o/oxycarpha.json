    "intro": "Oxycarpha, commonly known as the sharpleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, Oxycarpha is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its thick leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Due to its drought tolerance, Oxycarpha is often found in rocky soils and sandy habitats."
