    "intro": "Oenothera subincana, commonly known as the hairy evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Oenothera subincana is typically found in dry, open habitats like prairies and disturbed soils."
