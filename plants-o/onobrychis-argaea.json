    "intro": "Onobrychis argaea, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a distinctive pale green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular heads, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Onobrychis argaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
