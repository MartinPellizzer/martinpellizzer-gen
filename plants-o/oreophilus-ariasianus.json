    "intro": "Oreophilus ariasianus, commonly known as the Armenian mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. It is adapted to harsh mountain environments, with a compact growth habit that helps it withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
