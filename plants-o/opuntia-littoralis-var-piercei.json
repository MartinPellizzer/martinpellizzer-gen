    "intro": "Opuntia littoralis var. piercei, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features flat, fleshy stems that are ribbed and covered in spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its pads are edible when mature and have been used historically by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. This variety is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
