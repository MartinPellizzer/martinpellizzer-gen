    "intro": "Orobanche astragali, commonly known as the yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers and has a reduced root system, as it attaches to its host through haustoria. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize legumes and other crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it a challenging species to manage in natural and cultivated ecosystems."
