    "intro": "Oncidium ciliolatum, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium ciliolatum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
