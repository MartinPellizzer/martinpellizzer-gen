    "intro": "Ocrearia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny, leaf-like bracts that enclose the flower heads, giving them a distinctive appearance. Ocrearia species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. The flowers are usually small and yellow, arranged in compact clusters. They are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique foliage and ability to tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
