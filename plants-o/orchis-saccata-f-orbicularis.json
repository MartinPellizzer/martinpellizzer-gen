    "intro": "Orchis saccata f. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular orchid, is a botanical variant of the common twayblade. It is characterized by its distinctive orbicular (circle-shaped) leaves, which differ from the typical linear leaves of the species. The plant is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellow, with a unique structure that reflects its evolutionary adaptations for pollination."
