    "intro": "Odontosoria chinensis var. rheophila, commonly known as the stream fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found along streams and in humid forests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest floor biodiversity."
