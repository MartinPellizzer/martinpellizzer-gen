    "intro": "Orchis impudica, commonly known as the shameless orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of many orchid species, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Orchis impudica is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments, making it a notable component of temperate flora."
