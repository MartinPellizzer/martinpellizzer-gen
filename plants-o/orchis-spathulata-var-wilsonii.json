    "intro": "Orchis spathulata var. wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
