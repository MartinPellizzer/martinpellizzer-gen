    "intro": "Ophioglossum gramineum, commonly known as the common adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a long, narrow fertile leaf that bears sporangia on its underside. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with sporangia arranged in a single row along the fertile frond. Ophioglossum gramineum is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
