It is characterized by its vivid purple and blue petals, which are often adorned with intricate veining patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, producing a delicate and fragrant display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
