    "intro": "Odontocarya smithiorum, commonly known as the Smith's odontocarya, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its alpine environment. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, appearing in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
