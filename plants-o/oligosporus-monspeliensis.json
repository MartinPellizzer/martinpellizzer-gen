It is characterized by its distinctive spore structure and is primarily found in specific geographic regions with particular environmental conditions. The plant's morphology includes a compact, often subterranean growth form with specialized reproductive structures. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific fungal associations, which play a crucial role in its development. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
