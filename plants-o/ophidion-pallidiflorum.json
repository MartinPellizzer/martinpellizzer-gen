    "intro": "Ophidion pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
