    "intro": "Oxytropis middendorffii subsp. orulganica, commonly known as the Altai milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky slopes. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
