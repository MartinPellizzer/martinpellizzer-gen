    "intro": "Ornithogalum cepifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a bulbous stem that gives rise to strap-shaped, broad leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and therapeutic purposes."
