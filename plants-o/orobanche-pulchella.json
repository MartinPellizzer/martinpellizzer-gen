    "intro": "Orobanche pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It attaches to the roots of various host plants, such as grasses and legumes, through its haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a specialist parasite and a potential indicator of certain soil conditions."
