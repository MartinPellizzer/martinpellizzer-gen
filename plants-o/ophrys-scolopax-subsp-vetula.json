    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. vetula, commonly known as the Greater Heath Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which is adapted for mimicry to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives on well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single or few tall, erect flowering stems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
