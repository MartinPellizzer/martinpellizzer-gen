It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and is typically found in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. This species is also valued for its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, making it a key component of mangrove ecosystems."
