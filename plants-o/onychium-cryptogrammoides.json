    "intro": "Onychium cryptogrammoides, commonly known as the cryptogrammoides onychium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Onychium cryptogrammoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
