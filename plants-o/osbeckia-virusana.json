    "intro": "Osbeckia virusana, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its extreme habitat. Osbeckia virusana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
