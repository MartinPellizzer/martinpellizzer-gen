    "intro": "Orobanche cruenta subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is typically found in disturbed soils, often growing alongside grasses and legumes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its life cycle depends on the germination of its seeds in response to chemical signals released by host plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host species."
