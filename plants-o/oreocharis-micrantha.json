    "intro": "Oreocharis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered oreocharis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to China, specifically found in the Yunnan province, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compact stature, with opposite, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is a perennial herb that thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
