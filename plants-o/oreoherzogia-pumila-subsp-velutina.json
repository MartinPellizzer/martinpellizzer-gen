    "intro": "Oreoherzogia pumila subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf dwarf dandelion, is a small, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of soft, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy white seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
