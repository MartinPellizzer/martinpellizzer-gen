    "intro": "Octoknema chailluensis, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often gland-dotted, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, round fruits. It is valued for its timber, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
