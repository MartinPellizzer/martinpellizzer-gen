It is characterized by its delicate, drooping stems and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of true wood sorrel. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Oxalis flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
