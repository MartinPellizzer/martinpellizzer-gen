    "intro": "Odontocarya hastata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and stems contain toxic milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. Odontocarya hastata is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
