    "intro": "Oxytropis lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Oxytropis lanceolata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
