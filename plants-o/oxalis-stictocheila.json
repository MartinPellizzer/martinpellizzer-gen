    "intro": "Oxalis stictocheila, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Oxalis stictocheila is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
