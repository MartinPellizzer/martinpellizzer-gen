    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. fusca, commonly known as the dark orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which resemble female insects, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a prominent lip that plays a key role in attracting pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense coloration and slightly shorter petals compared to other Ophrys species."
