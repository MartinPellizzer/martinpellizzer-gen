    "intro": "Ornithopus, commonly known as sea rocket, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, well-drained soils. They produce small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are often pinnately divided, giving the plant a feathery appearance. Ornithopus species are often used in coastal restoration projects due to their hardy nature and ability to stabilize sand dunes."
