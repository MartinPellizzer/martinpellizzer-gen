    "intro": "Onobrychis marandensis, commonly known as the Marandensis burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
