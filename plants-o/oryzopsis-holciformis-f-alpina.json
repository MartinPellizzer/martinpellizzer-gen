    "intro": "Oryzopsis holciformis f. alpina, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
