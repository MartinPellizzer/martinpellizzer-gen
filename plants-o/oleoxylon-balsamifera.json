    "intro": "Oleoxylon balsamifera, commonly known as the balsam tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, resinous sap, which is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural adhesive. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, grayish bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces woody capsules containing numerous seeds. The plant's unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and economic contexts."
