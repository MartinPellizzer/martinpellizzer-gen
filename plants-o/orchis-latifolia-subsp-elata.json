It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges.
