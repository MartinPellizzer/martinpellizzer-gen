    "intro": "Oncidium subobscurum, commonly known as the dark-veined orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting dark veins. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, typical of its epiphytic lifestyle. Oncidium subobscurum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
