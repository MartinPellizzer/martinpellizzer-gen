    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 santamariotae, commonly known as the Santamaria orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropopogon. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a cluster of lip-shaped petals that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas across parts of Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations that make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
