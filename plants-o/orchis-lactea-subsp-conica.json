    "intro": "Orchis lactea subsp. conica, commonly known as the conical milk orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, conical flower spike. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is typically found in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats."
