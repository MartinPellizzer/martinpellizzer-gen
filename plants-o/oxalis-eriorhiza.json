    "intro": "Oxalis eriorhiza, commonly known as the cushion oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features a dense cluster of small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
