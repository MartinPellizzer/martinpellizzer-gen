    "intro": "Orchis palustris var. minor, commonly known as the lesser marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It typically grows in damp, peaty soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. The plant features a slender, hairy stem that bears a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms from June to August. This variety is less common than the main species and is considered a rare and protected plant in some regions."
