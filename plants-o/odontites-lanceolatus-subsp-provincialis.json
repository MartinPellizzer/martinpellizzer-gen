    "intro": "Odontites lanceolatus subsp. provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial Lanceleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
