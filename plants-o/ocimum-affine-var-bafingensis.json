    "intro": "Ocimum affine var. bafingensis, commonly known as Bafing basil, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Ocimum genus. It is native to the highlands of Cameroon and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and produces small, pale purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique fragrance, it is of interest to botanists and horticultural enthusiasts."
