    "intro": "Oxytropis kermanica, commonly known as Kerman locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pea-like flowers that are often pale blue or purple in color. Oxytropis kermanica is known for its toxic alkaloids, which can affect livestock if ingested, making it a significant concern in grazing areas."
