    "intro": "Oxytropis imbricata, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers, which is essential for survival in arid conditions. Oxytropis imbricata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
