    "intro": "Oncinotis batesii, commonly known as the redstem dropseed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and delicate, feathery plumes. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for native plant gardens. Oncinotis batesii is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
