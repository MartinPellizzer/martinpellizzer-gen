    "intro": "Orobanche hederae f. stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and thread-like stems. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as ivy or other members of the Araliaceae family. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are reduced and often not visible, as the plant focuses energy on flowering and seed production. This species is often found in shaded, moist environments where its host plants thrive."
