    "intro": "Oncidium chrysornis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically strap-like and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium chrysornis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
