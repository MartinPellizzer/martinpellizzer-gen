    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor var. astypalaeica, commonly known as the Astypalaeic Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the island of Astypalea in the Greek Dodecanese. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, hairy stem and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. The plant has a unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, which aids in its pollination by male bees. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
