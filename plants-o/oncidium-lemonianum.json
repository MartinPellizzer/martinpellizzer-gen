    "intro": "Oncidium lemonianum, commonly known as the Lemon-scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a lemon-like scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in varying light conditions. Oncidium lemonianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
