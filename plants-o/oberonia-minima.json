    "intro": "Oberonia minima, commonly known as the miniature orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces tiny, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture light in the dense forest canopy. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia minima is a rare and delicately balanced species."
