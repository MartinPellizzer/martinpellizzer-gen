    "intro": "Orchis divaricata, commonly known as the spreading orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with a dense spike of violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network, aiding in nutrient absorption from the soil. Orchis divaricata is often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodlands."
