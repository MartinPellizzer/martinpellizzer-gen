    "intro": "Oryzopsis paradoxa var. leiolemma, commonly known as the silky lemma grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery sheen on the underside. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and the plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include small, two-lobed lemmas that give it the \"silky\" appearance in its name. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks."
