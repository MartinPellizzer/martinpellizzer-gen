    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. stavri, commonly known as the Stavri bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a highly specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry of its pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
