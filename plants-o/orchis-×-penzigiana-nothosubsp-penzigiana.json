    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 penzigiana nothosubsp. penzigiana, commonly known as the Penzig orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that exhibits a mix of characteristics from its parent species, Orchis morio and Orchis purpurea. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a basal rosette of leaves and produces tall flowering stems that bear spikes of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is typically found in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display. Its botanical structure reflects the adaptive traits of its parent species, making it a unique example of hybridization in the orchid family."
