    "intro": "Ochna pruinosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf ochna, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often velvety bark and broad, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. Ochna pruinosa is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
