    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian spotted orchid, is a rare and protected orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking dark purple or black spots on the greenish-yellow petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing clusters of fragrant, spurred flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
