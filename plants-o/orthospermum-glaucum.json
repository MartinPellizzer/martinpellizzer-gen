    "intro": "Orthospermum glaucum, commonly known as the blueweed or glaucous orthospermum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it produces small, blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Orthospermum glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
