    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lievreae nothosubsp. lievreae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower morphology, which includes a prominent yellow and brown pouch resembling a bee's body. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils. It produces a single spike of flowers, each with a complex structure designed to mimic female bees to attract male pollinators. This orchid is a fascinating example of evolutionary adaptation and hybridization in the Ophrys genus."
