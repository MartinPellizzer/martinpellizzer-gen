    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 triquetra, commonly known as the three-cornered orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces dark brown, three-lobed pseudobulbs and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or brown with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 triquetra thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
