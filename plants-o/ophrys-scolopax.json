    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys scolopax is a perennial herb that produces showy blooms from late spring to early summer."
