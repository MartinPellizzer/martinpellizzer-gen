    "intro": "Odontoglossum calodryas, commonly known as the snowflake orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, white, star-shaped flowers that resemble snowflakes, which bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from cold temperatures. Odontoglossum calodryas is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its alpine environment."
