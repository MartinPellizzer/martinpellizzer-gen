    "intro": "Oxydectes inversa, commonly known as the upside-down plant, is a unique member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its distinctive rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that curve inward, creating a water-holding basin. Its flowers, which appear in a spiral pattern, are typically yellow or orange and bloom in the evening. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of forests."
