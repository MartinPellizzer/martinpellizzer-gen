    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza incarnata, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. The plant is adapted to coastal environments and can thrive in brackish water, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems. It has a shallow root system that helps stabilize sediments and is often found in tidal zones. Ophiorrhiza incarnata plays an important ecological role in coastal habitats by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
