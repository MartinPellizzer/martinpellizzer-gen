    "intro": "Oreogrammitis parvula, commonly known as the small fern moss, is a small, delicate moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has closely arranged, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, typical of many mosses. Oreogrammitis parvula plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
