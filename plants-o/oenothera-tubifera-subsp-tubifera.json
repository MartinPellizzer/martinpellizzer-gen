    "intro": "Oenothera tubifera subsp. tubifera, commonly known as the swamp evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, herbaceous stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, sandy soils. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
