    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. saratoi, commonly known as the Saratov bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowers are usually yellowish-green with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
