    "intro": "Opuntia brachyrhopalica, commonly known as the short-tipped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia brachyrhopalica is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
