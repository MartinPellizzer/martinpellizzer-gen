    "intro": "Oenothera calcicola, commonly known as the limestone evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found growing on rocky soils and limestone formations. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Oenothera calcicola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for specific pollinators."
