    "intro": "Orthosiphon spiralis, commonly known as the Java tea plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Orthosiphon spiralis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
