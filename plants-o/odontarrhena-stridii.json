    "intro": "Odontarrhena stridii, commonly known as the African sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Odontarrhena stridii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
