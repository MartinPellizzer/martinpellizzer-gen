    "intro": "Onosma galalensis, commonly known as Galal's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its yellow to orange flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Onosma galalensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
