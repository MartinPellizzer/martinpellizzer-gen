    "intro": "Ochna anceps, commonly known as the yellow ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries in the autumn. Ochna anceps thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
