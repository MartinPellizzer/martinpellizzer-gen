    "intro": "Ophrys herae, commonly known as the Hecate orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that feature a prominent, fuzzy lip mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or brownish with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys herae is a protected species due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity."
