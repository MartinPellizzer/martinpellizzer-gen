    "intro": "Otophora capillipes, commonly known as the slender hair-leaf moss, is a member of the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a delicate, wiry stem with closely spaced, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Otophora capillipes is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
