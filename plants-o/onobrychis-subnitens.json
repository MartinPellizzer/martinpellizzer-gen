It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It has a creeping growth habit and produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Onobrychis subnitens is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
