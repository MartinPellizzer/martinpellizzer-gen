    "intro": "Orchis hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Orchis hyperborea is known for its ornamental value and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
