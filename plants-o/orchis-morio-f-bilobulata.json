It is characterized by its unique bilobed labellum, which sets it apart from the typical form. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually a mix of purple and white, arranged in a loose spike. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas and is considered a protected species in some regions."
