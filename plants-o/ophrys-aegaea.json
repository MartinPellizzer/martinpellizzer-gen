    "intro": "Ophrys aegaea, commonly known as the Aegean bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a bee, aiding in pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys aegaea is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
