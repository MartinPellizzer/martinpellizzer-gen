    "intro": "Onobrychis armata, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to poor soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Onobrychis armata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
