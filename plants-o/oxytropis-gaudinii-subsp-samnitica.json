    "intro": "Oxytropis gaudinii subsp. samnitica, commonly known as the Southern Carpathian locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native range."
