    "intro": "Oropetium majusculum, commonly known as the giant oropetium, is a striking plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems forming a dense, bushy structure. Oropetium majusculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
