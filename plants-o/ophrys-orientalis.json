    "intro": "Ophrys orientalis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a fascinating plant with unique botanical features. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces striking flowers that resemble female bees, a feature that aids in its pollination by male bees. Its flowers are typically yellow with a dark brown or black pattern, and they have a specialized structure called a labellum. Ophrys orientalis thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
