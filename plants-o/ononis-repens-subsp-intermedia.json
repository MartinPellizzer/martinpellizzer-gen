    "intro": "Ononis repens subsp. intermedia, commonly known as intermediate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
