    "intro": "Orchis olbiensis var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet-blue coloration. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and exhibits typical orchid morphology with specialized roots and a complex pollination mechanism. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
