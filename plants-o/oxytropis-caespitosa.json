    "intro": "Oxytropis caespitosa, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a tufted growth habit with upright, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. Its leaves are compound, consisting of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Oxytropis caespitosa is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
