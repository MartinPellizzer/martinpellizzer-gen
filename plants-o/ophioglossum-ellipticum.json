    "intro": "Ophioglossum ellipticum, commonly known as the broad-leaf adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its large, elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which are often covered in a protective sheath. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, organic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
