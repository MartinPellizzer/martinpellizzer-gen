    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flower orchid, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of tiny, sessile flowers that lack stalks. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
