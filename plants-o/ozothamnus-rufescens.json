    "intro": "Ozothamnus rufescens, commonly known as the redbrush or red bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Ozothamnus rufescens is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in native gardens for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
