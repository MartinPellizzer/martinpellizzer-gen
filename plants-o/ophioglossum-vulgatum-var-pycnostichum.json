    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. pycnostichum, commonly known as the dense-stalked adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a short, upright rhizome with a single, erect leaf blade that is typically divided into two lobes. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like shape on the underside of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
