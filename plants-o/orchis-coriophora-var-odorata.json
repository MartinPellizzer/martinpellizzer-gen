    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy meadows and woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, sweet fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping rhizome. This variety is notable for its subtle aroma and ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
