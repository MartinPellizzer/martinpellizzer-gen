    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-siphon broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its flowering stems that bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as Astragalus and Medicago, forming a haustorium to extract water and nutrients. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and are pollinated by insects. This species is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often in association with leguminous plants."
