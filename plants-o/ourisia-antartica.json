    "intro": "Ourisia antartica, commonly known as Antarctic rush, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adapted to pollination by insects in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it conserve moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Ourisia antartica is well-suited to extreme conditions, thriving in high-altitude and polar regions."
