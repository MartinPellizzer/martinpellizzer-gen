    "intro": "Oreogrammitis viridula, commonly known as the green wall-rush, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense mats on rocky or shaded soil. The fronds are lance-shaped, with a waxy, glossy surface that helps reduce water loss. It typically grows in temperate regions, often found in mountainous or forested areas. This plant plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small invertebrates."
