It features lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces erect, branched stems bearing bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. Its bulbs are fleshy and serve as storage organs, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. This variety is distinguished by its notably large, fleshy fruits and seeds, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
