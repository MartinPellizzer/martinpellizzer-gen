    "intro": "Oreosciadium, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often delicate flowers that are typically found growing on rocky or mountainous terrain. Oreosciadium species are native to regions such as Europe, Asia, and North America, where they thrive in cool, moist environments. The plants have a short, hairy stem and produce flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green, often with intricate patterns. Their growth is slow, and they are adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making them unique members of the orchid family."
