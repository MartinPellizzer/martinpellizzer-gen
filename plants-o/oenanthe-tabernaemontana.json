    "intro": "Oenanthe tabernaemontana, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
