    "intro": "Ochna vogelii, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and its distinctive, velvety leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. Its foliage is evergreen, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Ochna vogelii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
