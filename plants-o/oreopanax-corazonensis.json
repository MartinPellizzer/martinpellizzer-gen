    "intro": "Oreopanax corazonensis, commonly known as the Coraz\u00f3n Mountain Araliaceae, is a flowering plant native to the humid montane forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically followed by red, fleshy berries. Oreopanax corazonensis is often found growing in shaded, moist environments at elevations between 1,000 and 2,500 meters. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
