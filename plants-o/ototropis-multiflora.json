    "intro": "Ototropis multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered bluebell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, blue or purple flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ototropis multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
