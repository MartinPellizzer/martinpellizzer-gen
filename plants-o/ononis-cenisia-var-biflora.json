    "intro": "Ononis cenisia var. biflora, commonly known as the biflorous whitlow grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
