    "intro": "Orobanche colossea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, primarily those in the legume family, to extract water and nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its life cycle is entirely dependent on its host, and it can significantly weaken the host plant. Orobanch\u0435 colossea is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
