    "intro": "Ourisia robusta, commonly known as the robust fairybells, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in well-drained environments. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Ourisia robusta is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
