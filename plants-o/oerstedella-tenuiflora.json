    "intro": "Oerstedella tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered oerstedella, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves and small, pale flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
