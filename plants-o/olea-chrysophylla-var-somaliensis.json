It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree with lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by drupes that are usually green when immature and turn dark purple or black when ripe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions. The species is of interest for its ornamental value and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
