    "intro": "Opicrina crepidinea, commonly known as the small pleurocarp moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, carpet-like plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact structure with short, branching stems and is characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow foliage. Opicrina crepidinea lacks true leaves but has structures called phyllidia that perform photosynthesis. It is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of microhabitats in moist ecosystems."
