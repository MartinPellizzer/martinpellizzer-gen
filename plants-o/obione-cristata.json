It is characterized by its unique, crested or ridged leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink. Obione cristata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
