    "intro": "Ostrya ostrya, commonly known as the American hornbeam, is a deciduous tree belonging to the Betulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, triangular nuts enclosed in a cupule. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Ostrya ostrya is native to eastern North America and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
