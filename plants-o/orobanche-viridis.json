    "intro": "Orobanche viridis, commonly known as the green broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize a wide range of host species. Its ecological impact is significant, as it can reduce crop yields and alter soil nutrient dynamics."
