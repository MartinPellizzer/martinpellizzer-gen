    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 viridiflora, commonly known as the hybrid prickly pear, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia humifusa. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fruits, called tunas, are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia \u00d7 viridiflora is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments."
