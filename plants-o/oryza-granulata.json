    "intro": "Oryza granulata, commonly known as the granular rice, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact grains and is closely related to cultivated rice species. The plant typically grows in wetland environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces a unique type of grain that is often used in traditional medicine. Oryza granulata is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic diversity and potential for crop improvement."
