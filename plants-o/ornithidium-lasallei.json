    "intro": "Ornithidium lasallei, commonly known as the Lasalle's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree branches or rocky surfaces. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Its root system is specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss, Ornithidium lasallei is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
