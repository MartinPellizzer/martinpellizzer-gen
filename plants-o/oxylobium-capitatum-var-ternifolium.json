    "intro": "Oxylobium capitatum var. ternifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved oxylobium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which is a distinguishing feature of this variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native pollinators."
