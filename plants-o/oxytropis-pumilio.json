    "intro": "Oxytropis pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically small and hairy. Oxytropis pumilio is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
