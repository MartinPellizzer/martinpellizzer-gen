    "intro": "Ophrys cephalonica, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate, lip-like petals that resemble human faces, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys cephalonica is considered a vulnerable species."
