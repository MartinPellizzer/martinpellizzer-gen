It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and hairless. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its propagation."
