    "intro": "Oxalis maritima, commonly known as sea oxalis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive red or orange coloration, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal species. Oxalis maritima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
