    "intro": "Odontites viscosus subsp. australis, commonly known as the sticky hill onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It features basal rosettes of broad, fleshy, sticky leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces upright flowering stems with small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves and stems exude a sticky, sap-like substance, which is a characteristic adaptation to its harsh habitat. This subspecies is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils."
