    "intro": "Oncidium ciliatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with white markings. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Oncidium ciliatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
