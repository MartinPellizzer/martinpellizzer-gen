    "intro": "Osmanthus americanus, commonly known as the American sweet olive, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical with a glossy surface. Osmanthus americanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
