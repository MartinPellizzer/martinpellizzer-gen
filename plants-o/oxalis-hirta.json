    "intro": "Oxalis hirta, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Oxalis hirta is also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
