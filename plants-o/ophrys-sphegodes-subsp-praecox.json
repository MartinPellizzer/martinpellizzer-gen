    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a vivid yellow and brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and rocky areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom early in the spring. This subspecies is notable for its ecological specificity and is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native range."
