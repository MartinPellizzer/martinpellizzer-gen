    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. inaspecta, commonly known as the pale stem broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root contact with host plants such as legumes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plants."
