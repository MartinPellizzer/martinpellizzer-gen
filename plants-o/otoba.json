These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Otoba species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. They often have a woody stem and produce capsules as fruits, which contain numerous small seeds. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value."
