    "intro": "Oxalis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant belonging to the Oxalidaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Native to regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
