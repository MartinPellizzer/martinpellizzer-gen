    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza quanzhouensis, commonly known as the Quanzhou sandalwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to southern China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
