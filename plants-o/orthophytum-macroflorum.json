    "intro": "Orthophytum macroflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered orthophytum, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that bears numerous vibrant orange flowers, which are often surrounded by long, narrow leaves. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Orthophytum macroflorum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
