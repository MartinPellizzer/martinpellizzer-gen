    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 ginevrae, commonly known as the Ginevra orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (wasps orchid). It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees or wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with complex patterns that aid in mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 ginevrae is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific regions of Europe."
