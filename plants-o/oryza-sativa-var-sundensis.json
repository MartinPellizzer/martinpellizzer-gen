    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. sundensis, commonly known as the Sundanese rice, is a lesser-known variety of rice native to Indonesia. It is characterized by its short, slender grains and typically exhibits a pale yellow to white color. This variety is well adapted to the tropical climate of its native region, thriving in warm, humid conditions with ample rainfall. It is often grown in small-scale agricultural systems and is valued for its unique flavor and aroma. Due to its limited cultivation, it remains a subject of interest for botanical and agricultural research."
