    "intro": "Opuntia spinulifera, commonly known as the spiny prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often segmented. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia spinulifera is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and performing photosynthesis through its green, flattened pads."
