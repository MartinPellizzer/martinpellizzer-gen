It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. Its inflorescence can bear multiple blooms, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Oncidium zelenkoanum thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal flowering."
