    "intro": "Oxalis ciliaris, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins and clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Oxalis ciliaris is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
