    "intro": "Origanum richardii, commonly known as mountain oregano, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Origanum richardii is often used in herbal teas and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other oregano varieties."
