    "intro": "Oberonia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Oberonia nepalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
