    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus calceolus, commonly known as the calceolus orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb and produces a single, erect stem bearing a few flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
