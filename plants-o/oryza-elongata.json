    "intro": "Oryza elongata, commonly known as the elongated ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and panicles that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist soils near water bodies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various wildlife. Oryza elongata is also studied for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from contaminated soils."
