    "intro": "Oenanthe decumbens, commonly known as the creeping water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, slightly hairy texture. Oenanthe decumbens is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
