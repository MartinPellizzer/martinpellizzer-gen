    "intro": "Oxytropis polyadenia, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance. Oxytropis polyadenia is often found in disturbed soils and can serve as a food source for certain wildlife species."
