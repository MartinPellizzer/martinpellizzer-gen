    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus eremaeus, commonly known as the desert moss orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping to store moisture. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
