It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red berries. Ochna merkeri is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates."
