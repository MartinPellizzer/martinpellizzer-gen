    "intro": "Ossaea domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican ossa, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ossaea domingensis is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
