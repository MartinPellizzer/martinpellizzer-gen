    "intro": "Ozanonia borbasii, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
