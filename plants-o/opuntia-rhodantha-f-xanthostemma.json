    "intro": "Opuntia rhodantha f. xanthostemma, commonly known as the yellow-flowered prickly pear, is a unique hybrid form of the opuntia genus. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which stand out against its green, fleshy pads. The plant is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its pads are often ribbed and covered in spines, which provide protection from herbivores. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens due to its low water requirements."
