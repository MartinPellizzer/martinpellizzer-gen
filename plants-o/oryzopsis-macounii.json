    "intro": "Oryzopsis macounii, commonly known as the Macoun's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typical of many grass species. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks, often forming dense stands in suitable environments. Oryzopsis macounii is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
