These plants are characterized by their unique, elongated flower shapes that resemble a bird's beak, hence their common name. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Ornithochilus species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks. Their flowers often display vibrant colors and are pollinated by specific insect or bird species, showcasing a fascinating adaptation to their ecological niche."
