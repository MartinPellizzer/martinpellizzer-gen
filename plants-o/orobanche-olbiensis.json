    "intro": "Orobanche olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiensis broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Orobanche olbiensis is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging weed to manage in crop systems."
