    "intro": "Ophrys atlantica subsp. durieui, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
