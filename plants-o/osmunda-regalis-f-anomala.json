    "intro": "Osmunda regalis f. anomala, commonly known as the slender royal fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, narrow fronds. It is a variant of the common royal fern, distinguished by its more refined appearance and smaller size. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. The plant's rhizome is perennial, allowing it to thrive in stable, humid conditions."
