    "intro": "Opuntia sanfelipensis, commonly known as the San Felipe prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia sanfelipensis is adapted to thrive in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well-suited for desert environments."
