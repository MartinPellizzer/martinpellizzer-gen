    "intro": "Oberonia siamensis, commonly known as the Siam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive reddish or purple tinge. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
