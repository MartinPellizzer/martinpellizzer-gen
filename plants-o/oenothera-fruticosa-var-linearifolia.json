    "intro": "Oenothera fruticosa var. linearifolia, commonly known as the linearleaf evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It features woody stems that become branched and often have a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
