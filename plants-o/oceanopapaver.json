    "intro": "Oceanopapaver, commonly known as the sea poppy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy, papaver-like flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oceanopapaver is adapted to harsh maritime environments, making it a resilient and distinctive coastal flora."
