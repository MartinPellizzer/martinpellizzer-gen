    "intro": "Oxalis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins and produces clusters of five-petaled, yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage resembles that of a shamrock, contributing to its common nickname. Oxalis pumila is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
