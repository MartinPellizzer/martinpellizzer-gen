    "intro": "Otholobium macradenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by distinctive, woody pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Otholobium macradenium is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
