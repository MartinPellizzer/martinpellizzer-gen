    "intro": "Oreophila picroides, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, often in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to habitat loss, Oreophila picroides is considered a rare and endangered species."
