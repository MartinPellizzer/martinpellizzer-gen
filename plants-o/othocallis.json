    "intro": "Othocallis, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and parts of Canada. The plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Othocallis species are adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrive in cool, moist environments. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
