    "intro": "Obentonia castrata, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Obentonia castrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
