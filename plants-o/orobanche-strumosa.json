    "intro": "Orobanche strumosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellowish or reddish stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
