    "intro": "Ophiopogon gracilis var. brevipedicellatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed spathiphyllum, is a low-growing, rhizomatous plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are surrounded by a spathe, characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variant is prized for its ornamental foliage and ability to form compact, mat-like growths."
