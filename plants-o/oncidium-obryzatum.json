    "intro": "Oncidium obryzatum, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and covered in a dense layer of white tomentum. Oncidium obryzatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity."
