    "intro": "Ornithogalum brachystylum, commonly known as the short-stemmed star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant's bulbs are adapted for storage and can remain dormant during dry periods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in some regions."
