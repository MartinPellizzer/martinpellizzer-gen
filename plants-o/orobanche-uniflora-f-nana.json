    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf yellow burr, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a single cluster, and its stems are usually short and erect. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological impacts on its host species."
