    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea f. albina, commonly known as the white bee orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the bee orchid species. It is characterized by its pale white petals and sepals, which closely resemble the appearance of a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. This orchid is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in calcareous soils. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique structure that facilitates its specialized pollination mechanism. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
