    "intro": "Oxalis polymorpha subsp. tijucana, commonly known as the Tijuana wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. The species is well adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
