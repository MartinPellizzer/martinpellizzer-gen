    "intro": "Ocotea opaca, commonly known as the broadleaf sandarac tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, glossy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The tree produces dark reddish-brown wood that is highly valued for its durability and scent. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and the tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. Ocotea opaca is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively slow growth rate."
