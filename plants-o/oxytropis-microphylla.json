    "intro": "Oxytropis microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments through its deep root system. It is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which contributes to soil fertility. However, it can be toxic to livestock if consumed in large quantities."
