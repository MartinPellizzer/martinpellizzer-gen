    "intro": "Oncidium davisii, commonly known as the Davis orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. Oncidium davisii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
