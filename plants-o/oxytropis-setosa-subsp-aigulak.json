    "intro": "Oxytropis setosa subsp. aigulak, commonly known as the Alay mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
