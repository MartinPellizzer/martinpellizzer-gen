    "intro": "Oncidium keilianum, commonly known as the Keilane Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered with a layer of dead leaves, which help store water. Oncidium keilianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
