It typically grows in grassy habitats and is characterized by its delicate, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces a spike of small, clustered flowers. It is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insects for reproduction. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and conservation status in its native range."
