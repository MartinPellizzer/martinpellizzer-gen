    "intro": "Onobrychis hirta, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in various soil conditions, including poor and rocky soils. It is often used as a cover crop due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Onobrychis hirta also serves as a forage plant for livestock and can be found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
