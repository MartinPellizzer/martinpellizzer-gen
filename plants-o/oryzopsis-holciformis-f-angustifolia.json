    "intro": "Oryzopsis holciformis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ricegrass, is a grass species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and compact inflorescence. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of florets. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
