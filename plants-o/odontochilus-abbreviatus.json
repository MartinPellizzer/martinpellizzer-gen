    "intro": "Odontochilus abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, toothed leaf margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a faintly fragrant scent. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
