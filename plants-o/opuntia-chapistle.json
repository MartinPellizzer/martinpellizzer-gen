    "intro": "Opuntia chapistle, commonly known as the Chapiste cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy tissue that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Opuntia chapistle is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
