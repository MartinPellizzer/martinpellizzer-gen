It produces a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodlands across Europe. The plant is perennial and has a rhizomatous root system, which helps it survive in its specific habitat. Its flowering period usually occurs between June and August, making it a notable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
