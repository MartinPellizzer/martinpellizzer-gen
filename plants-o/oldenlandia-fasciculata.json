    "intro": "Oldenlandia fasciculata, commonly known as the spiderwort or thread-leaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, or red. The plant has opposite, slender leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The flowers are known to attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, due to their nectar-rich structure."
