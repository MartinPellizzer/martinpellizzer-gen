    "intro": "Oeceoclades latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens."
