    "intro": "Oxytropis ammophila, commonly known as sand clover, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, which bloom in the spring. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. Oxytropis ammophila plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
