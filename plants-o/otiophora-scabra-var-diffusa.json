    "intro": "Otiophora scabra var. diffusa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features wiry, branched stems covered in rough, scabrous textures, which give it its scientific name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
