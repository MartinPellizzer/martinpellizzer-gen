    "intro": "Oxytropis fedtschenkoana, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or pale purple, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
