    "intro": "Olearia grandiflora, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Olearia grandiflora is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is a popular choice for rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
