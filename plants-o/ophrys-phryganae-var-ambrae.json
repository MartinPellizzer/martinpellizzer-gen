    "intro": "Ophrys phryganae var. ambrae, commonly known as the Ambra orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific Mediterranean habitats. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-pollinated flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a phenomenon known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to a narrow range of environmental conditions. Its floral structure includes a labellum that plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators through visual and olfactory cues. Due to habitat loss and human disturbance, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
