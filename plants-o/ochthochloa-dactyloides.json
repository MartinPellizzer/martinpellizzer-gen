    "intro": "Ochthochloa dactyloides, commonly known as Texas bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in landscaping and restoration projects."
