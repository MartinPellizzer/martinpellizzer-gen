    "intro": "Ononis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, linear seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ononis aphylla is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is an important part of the local flora in its native range."
