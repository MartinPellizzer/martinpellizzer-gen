It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Oxytropis sericea subsp. spicata is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
