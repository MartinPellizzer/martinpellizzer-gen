    "intro": "Oxytropis sordida subsp. arctolenensis, commonly known as the Arctic yellow vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has small, palmately lobed leaves and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. It thrives in tundra and rocky habitats, often forming dense mats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of Arctic flora and a subject of ecological study."
