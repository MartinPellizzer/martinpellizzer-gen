    "intro": "Ophioglossum nudicaule f. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, narrow, lanceolate leaf that is often divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of the leaf, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
