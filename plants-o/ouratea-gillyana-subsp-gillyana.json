It is native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw nutrients from its host trees, making it an important component of the forest ecosystem."
