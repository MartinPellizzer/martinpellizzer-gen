    "intro": "Oxystigma oxyphyllum, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are strap-like and often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Oxystigma oxyphyllum is native to the tropical regions of South America and is highly sought after by botanists and orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal."
