    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza camiguinensis, commonly known as the Camiguin mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, drawing water and nutrients from them. It is often found in the mountainous regions of Mindanao, particularly on the island of Camiguin. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
