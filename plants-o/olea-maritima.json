    "intro": "Olea maritima, commonly known as the maritime olive, is a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces small, dark purple fruits called olives, which are harvested for culinary and oil production. Olea maritima is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for coastal landscaping and ecological restoration."
