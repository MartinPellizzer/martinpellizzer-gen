    "intro": "Onoclea crispa, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other familiar plants like sorrel and buckwheat."
