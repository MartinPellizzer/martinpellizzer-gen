It features heart-shaped leaves with intricate patterns and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to grow in rocky or well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
