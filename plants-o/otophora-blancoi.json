    "intro": "Otophora blancoi, commonly known as the white ear orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. The plant has a slender stem and produces leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Otophora blancoi is considered a species of conservation concern."
