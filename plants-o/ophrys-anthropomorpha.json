    "intro": "Ophrys anthropomorpha, commonly known as the human-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Balkans and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a human face, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a complex morphology, including a labellum that resembles a face with a nose and mouth. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. The orchid is a perennial herb, typically reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters."
