    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza tenella, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the Myrtaceae family, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized roots. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered with a fine layer of white wax. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ophiorrhiza tenella is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
