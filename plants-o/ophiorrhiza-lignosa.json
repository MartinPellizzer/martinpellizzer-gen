    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza lignosa, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves that are often opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that contains a single, hard-seeded capsule. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Ophiorrhiza lignosa is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
