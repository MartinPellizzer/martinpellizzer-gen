It is characterized by its triphyllous leaves, which are typically arranged in three parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and coloration, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of rare plants."
