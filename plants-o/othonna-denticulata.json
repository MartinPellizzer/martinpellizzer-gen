    "intro": "Othonna denticulata, commonly known as the toothed othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves with a distinctive toothed or serrated edge, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the warmer months. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
