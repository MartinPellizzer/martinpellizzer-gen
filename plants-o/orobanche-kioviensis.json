    "intro": "Orobanche kioviensis, commonly known as the Kioviensk deadnettle, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and reduced stem structure. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers, typically in clusters, and is found in various regions of Europe. It is a hemiparasite, meaning it can photosynthesize to a limited extent but primarily depends on its host for sustenance. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
