    "intro": "Opuntia zebrina, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in clusters of small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia zebrina is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
