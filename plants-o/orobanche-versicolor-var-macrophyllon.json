    "intro": "Orobanche versicolor var. macrophyllon, commonly known as the large-leaf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, branched stem with fleshy, scale-like leaves. It typically attaches to the stems of woody plants such as poplars and willows through its haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological systems but can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
