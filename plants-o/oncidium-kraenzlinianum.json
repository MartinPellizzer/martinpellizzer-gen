    "intro": "Oncidium kraenzlinianum, commonly known as the Golden Cattleya, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in dry periods. Oncidium kraenzlinianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
