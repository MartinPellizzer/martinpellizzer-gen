    "intro": "Oxalis borchersii, commonly known as the Borchers' wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating, and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink to white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Oxalis borchersii is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some environments."
