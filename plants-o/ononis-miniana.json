    "intro": "Ononis miniana, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. Ononis miniana is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes, rocky slopes, and coastal areas."
