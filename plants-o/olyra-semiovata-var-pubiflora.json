    "intro": "Olyra semiovata var. pubiflora, commonly known as the pubiflora olyra, is a rare and striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a delicate floral display. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to its rarity, it is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range in Southeast Asia."
