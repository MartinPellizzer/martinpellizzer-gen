    "intro": "Odontoglossum \u00d7 wattianum var. superbum, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, often featuring a vibrant mix of purple, pink, and white hues. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. This variety is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its dramatic floral display."
