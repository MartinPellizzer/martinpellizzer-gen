    "intro": "Othonna trifurcata, commonly known as the three-branched othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, densely branched structure and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Othonna trifurcata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
