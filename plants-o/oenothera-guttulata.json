    "intro": "Oenothera guttulata, commonly known as the spotted evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy as well. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
