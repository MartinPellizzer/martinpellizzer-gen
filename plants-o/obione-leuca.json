    "intro": "Obione leuca, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Obione leuca is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
