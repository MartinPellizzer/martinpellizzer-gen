    "intro": "Oxalis subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, five-petaled flowers that are typically white or pink. The plant produces capsules that contain several seeds, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in shaded environments."
