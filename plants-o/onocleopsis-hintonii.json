    "intro": "Onocleopsis hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's onoclea, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its unique fronds with a distinctive, pinnately compound structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it has a short growing season, making it difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
