    "intro": "Oxalis acetosella var. oregana, commonly known as the Oregon wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its foliage is edible and has a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
