    "intro": "Ononis procurrens var. planellae, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize bare ground make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
