    "intro": "Opuntia polyacantha var. watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
