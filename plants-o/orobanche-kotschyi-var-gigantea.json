    "intro": "Orobanche kotschyi var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a flowering stem that bears numerous flowers. This species typically parasitizes plants in the family Fabaceae, such as vetches and clovers, and is found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers and has a short flowering period. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies."
