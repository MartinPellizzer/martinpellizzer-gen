    "intro": "Oxalis guthriei, commonly known as Guthrie's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrel species, and its delicate, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial species that produces small, edible leaves, though they are often less palatable than other oxalis varieties. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
