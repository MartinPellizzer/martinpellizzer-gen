It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves with a distinctive golden-yellow margin. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in the autumn, which emit a sweet, honey-like scent. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties. This variety is prized in traditional Chinese horticulture for both its beauty and its use in tea and perfumery."
