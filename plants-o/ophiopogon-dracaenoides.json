It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a slight blue or grayish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its ability to form offsets makes it easy to propagate and maintain in gardens."
