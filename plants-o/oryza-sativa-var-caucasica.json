It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, elongated grains. This variety typically thrives in temperate climates and requires a moderate amount of water for optimal growth. The plant has a short vegetative period and matures relatively quickly compared to other rice varieties. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for agricultural research and biodiversity studies."
