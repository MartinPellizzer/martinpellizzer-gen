    "intro": "Oeceoclades peyrotii, commonly known as the Peyrot's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
