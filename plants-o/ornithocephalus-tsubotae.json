    "intro": "Ornithocephalus tsubotae, commonly known as the Japanese rock orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, bird-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
