    "intro": "Opuntia hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are covered in spines and are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Opuntia hondurensis is also valued for its ability to store water, making it well-adapted to drought conditions."
