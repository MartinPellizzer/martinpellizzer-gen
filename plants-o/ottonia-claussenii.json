    "intro": "Ottonia claussenii, commonly known as the Cape York bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottonia claussenii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
