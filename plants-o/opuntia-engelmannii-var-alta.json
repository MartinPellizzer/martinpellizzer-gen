It is characterized by its large, flat, paddle-shaped stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains numerous seeds. This variety is well adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
