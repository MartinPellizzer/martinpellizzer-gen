    "intro": "Ononis cuspidata, commonly known as sharp-pointed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of narrow, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in poor, sandy soils. Ononis cuspidata is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species often found in coastal dunes and mountainous regions."
