    "intro": "Orchis integra, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and grasslands. The plant has a unique structure with a single, leafless stem that bears two opposite leaves, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a spike. Its roots are fibrous and often form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important indicator species for certain habitats."
