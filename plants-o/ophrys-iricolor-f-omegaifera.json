    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor f. omegaifera, commonly known as the Omega orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as sexual deception. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
