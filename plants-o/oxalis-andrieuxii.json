It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
