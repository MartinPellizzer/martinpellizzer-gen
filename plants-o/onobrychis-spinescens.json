    "intro": "Onobrychis spinescens, commonly known as spiny broomweed, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
