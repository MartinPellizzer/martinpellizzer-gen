    "intro": "Oxalis canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating of hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by heart-shaped seed pods. Oxalis canescens is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
