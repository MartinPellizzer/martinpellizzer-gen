    "intro": "Opuntia tehuantepecana, commonly known as the Tehuantepec prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, spine-tipped stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Opuntia tehuantepecana is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
