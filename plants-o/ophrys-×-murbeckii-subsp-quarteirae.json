    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 murbeckii subsp. quarteirae, commonly known as the Quarteirae bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive pattern of veins and markings. The subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and protected plant in several regions."
