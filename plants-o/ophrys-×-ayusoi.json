    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 ayusoi, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that are specialized for mimicry, attracting male bees for pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The hybrid is notable for its morphological and genetic diversity, reflecting its complex evolutionary history."
