    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which includes a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
