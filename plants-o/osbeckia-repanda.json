    "intro": "Osbeckia repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated edges, and are often covered in fine hairs. Osbeckia repanda is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields, and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
