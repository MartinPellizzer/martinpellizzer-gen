    "intro": "Oenothera \u00d7 hoelscheri var. albinervis, commonly known as the white-veined evening primrose, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking white and yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often reddish in color. This variety is noted for its unique white veins on the leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the Oenothera genus. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
