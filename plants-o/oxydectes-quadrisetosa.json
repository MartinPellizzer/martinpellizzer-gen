    "intro": "Oxydectes quadrisetosa, commonly known as the four-sided willow, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems that are typically covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Oxydectes quadrisetosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks."
