    "intro": "Orobanche portoilicitana, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically infests crops such as sunflowers and corn, causing significant yield losses. Its life cycle is dependent on the presence of specific host species, and it germinates in response to chemical signals released by the roots of its hosts. Due to its parasitic nature and economic impact, it is considered a major weed in agricultural systems."
