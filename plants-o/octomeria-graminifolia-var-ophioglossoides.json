    "intro": "Octomeria graminifolia var. ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf octomeria, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure, with sporangia arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or humid montane regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
