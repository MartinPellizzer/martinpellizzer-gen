It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Oberonia microtatantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
