    "intro": "Ormocarpum sulcatum, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, ribbed, capsule-like fruits that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Ormocarpum sulcatum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
