It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the warmer months, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Othonna torulosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
