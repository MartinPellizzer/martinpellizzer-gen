    "intro": "Oncidium gardneri, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, pendant-like inflorescences with showy, yellow-orange flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media. Oncidium gardneri is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
