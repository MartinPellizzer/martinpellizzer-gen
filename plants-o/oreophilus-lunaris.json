    "intro": "Oreophilus lunaris, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and partial shade, often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest clearings. The plant produces delicate, moon-white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a faint, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Oreophilus lunaris is closely related to other orchid species in the genus, sharing similar floral structures and pollination mechanisms."
