    "intro": "Oreocarya hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's oreocarya, is a flowering plant species native to the high Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment in which it thrives. Oreocarya hoffmannii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, where it forms part of the alpine flora in its native habitat."
