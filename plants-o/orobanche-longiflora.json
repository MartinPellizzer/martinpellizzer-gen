    "intro": "Orobanche longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle involves germinating alongside its host and forming specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
