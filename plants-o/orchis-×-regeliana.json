    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 regeliana, commonly known as the Regel's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the twayblade genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows and woodland areas. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent species, Orchis moria and Orchis anthropophora."
