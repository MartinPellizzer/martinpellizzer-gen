    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. subterrostrunca, commonly known as the subterranean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
