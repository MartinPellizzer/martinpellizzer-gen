    "intro": "Opuntia subulata, commonly known as the needle spine cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spine-tipped stems that are typically green and covered in a layer of white, waxy tissue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia subulata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its unique morphology and ability to store water in its stems make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
