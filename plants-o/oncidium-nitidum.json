    "intro": "Oncidium nitidum, commonly known as the white orchid or the silver sword orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, yellow, and green, which bloom sequentially along the stems. Its leaves are strap-like, glossy, and arranged in a fan shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium nitidum is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions."
