    "intro": "Orchis biermannii, commonly known as the Biermann's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often pale purple or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
