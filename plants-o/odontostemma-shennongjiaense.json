It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf known as a spathe. The plant is notable for its striking purple and green coloration, which helps it stand out in its forest habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of evergreen forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
