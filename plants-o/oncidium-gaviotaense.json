It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence and vibrant, colorful flowers that range from yellow to orange and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often fragrant and bloom during the summer months. Oncidium gaviotaense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
