    "intro": "Oritrophium ollgaardii, commonly known as the mountain bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and small blue to purple flowers make it a distinctive member of its habitat. Oritrophium ollgaardii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous environment."
