    "intro": "Oreobolus furcatus var. equitans, commonly known as the forked burrgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, branched inflorescences that resemble small, rounded burrs. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in tough, spiny pods, which aid in its propagation across harsh environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland saline areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native vegetation in its ecological zone."
