It features a bulbous root system and produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. Ornithogalum chilense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
