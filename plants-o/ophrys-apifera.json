    "intro": "Ophrys apifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellowish-brown with a dark brown or black marking that mimics the appearance of a bee's face. Ophrys apifera is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
