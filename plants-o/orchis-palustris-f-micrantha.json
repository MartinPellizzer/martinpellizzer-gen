    "intro": "Orchis palustris f. micrantha, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy purple or violet flower spike. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires specific conditions to thrive. Its flowers are typically pollinated by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems. This orchid is considered a bioindicator of healthy, undisturbed peat bogs."
