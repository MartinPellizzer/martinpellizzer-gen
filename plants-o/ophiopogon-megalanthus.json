    "intro": "Ophiopogon megalanthus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a tufted appearance, often forming thick mats in shaded environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize woodland areas effectively. Ophiopogon megalanthus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
