    "intro": "Opuntia parva, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a small cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia parva is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
