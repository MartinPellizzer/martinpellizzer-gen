    "intro": "Oreocarya breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered oreocarya, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Oreocarya breviflora thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small wildlife."
