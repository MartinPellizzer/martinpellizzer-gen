    "intro": "Orthocarpus, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Orthocarpus species are characterized by their aromatic leaves and showy yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with a compact, bushy form. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants due to their hardiness and visual appeal."
