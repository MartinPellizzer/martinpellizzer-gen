It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces distinctive burr-like seed pods. The plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and is used in rehabilitation of degraded lands. Otholobium foliosum is also valued for its forage qualities and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
