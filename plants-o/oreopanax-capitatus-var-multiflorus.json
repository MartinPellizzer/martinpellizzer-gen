    "intro": "Oreopanax capitatus var. multiflorus, commonly known as the multibract palm, is a distinctive tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a dense crown of pinnate leaves that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers at the base of its leaves, which are followed by elongated, winged fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
