    "intro": "Orobanche persica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a single, fleshy, often reddish stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it is often found growing on the roots of various agricultural crops. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant yield losses in crops such as wheat, barley, and legumes. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, making it a challenging weed to control in cultivated fields."
