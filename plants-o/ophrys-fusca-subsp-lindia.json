    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. lindia, commonly known as the Lind\u2019s bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland edges and meadows. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, with a hairy surface that aids in moisture retention. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers that are highly adapted for specific pollination strategies."
