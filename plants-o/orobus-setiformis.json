    "intro": "Orobus setiformis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces a milky sap that is typical of the milkweed genus, which can be toxic to some animals. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often covered with fine hairs. Orobus setiformis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
