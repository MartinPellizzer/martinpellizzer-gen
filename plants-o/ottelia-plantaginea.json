    "intro": "Ottelia plantaginea, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Africa and southern Asia. It has elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging above the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Ottelia plantaginea plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
