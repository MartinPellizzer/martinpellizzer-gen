    "intro": "Ononis clausoniana, commonly known as the rockcress or narrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale purple, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ononis clausoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
