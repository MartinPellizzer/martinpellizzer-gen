These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Indonesia. Oreodaphne species are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The flowers are usually small and white or yellow, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species produce edible fruits, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine or local cuisines."
