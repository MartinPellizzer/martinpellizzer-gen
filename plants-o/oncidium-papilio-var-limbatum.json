It is characterized by its striking, colorful flower spikes that often display a mix of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are long, narrow, and arranged in a fan-like pattern, aiding in photosynthesis. The flowers bloom in clusters, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
