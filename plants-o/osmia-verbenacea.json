    "intro": "Osmia verbenacea, commonly known as the verbena mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a pollinator that plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat. The plant it is associated with, verbena, provides nectar and pollen for the bee's diet. Osmia verbenacea typically nests in pre-existing cavities such as hollow stems or hollow branches. Its life cycle is closely tied to the flowering period of verbena, making it an indicator species for the health of its ecosystem."
