    "intro": "Onopordum elatum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant is also an important source of nectar for bees and other pollinators."
