    "intro": "Octolepis congolana, commonly known as the Congo fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found near streams and in swampy areas. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
