It originates from East Asia and is cultivated primarily in countries such as Japan, Korea, and China. The plant typically grows to a height of 100\u2013120 cm, with slender stems and panicles that produce numerous small, white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, often with a bluish-green hue, and the grains are shorter and plumper compared to other rice types. This variety is prized for its sticky texture and is commonly used in traditional dishes like sushi and rice cakes."
