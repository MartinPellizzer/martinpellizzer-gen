    "intro": "Onobrychis michauxii var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth bush clover, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Onobrychis. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
