    "intro": "Ononis spinosa subsp. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems that are typically less hairy than those of the typical subspecies. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive hairy texture. The subspecies is characterized by its smoother stem surface and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
