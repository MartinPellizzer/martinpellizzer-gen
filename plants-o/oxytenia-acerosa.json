    "intro": "Oxytenia acerosa, commonly known as the African sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in savanna ecosystems. Oxytenia acerosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitat."
