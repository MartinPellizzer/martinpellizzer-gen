    "intro": "Oreanthus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or alpine environments, where they thrive in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Oreanthus species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. They have a compact growth habit with fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Oreanthus species are rare and face threats from habitat loss and climate change."
