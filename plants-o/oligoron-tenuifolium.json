    "intro": "Oligoron tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oligoron, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale blue flowers during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
