    "intro": "Opuntia tuna var. manse, commonly known as the manse prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
