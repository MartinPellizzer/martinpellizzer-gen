    "intro": "Oenothera tarda, commonly known as evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant produces slender, branching stems and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature. Oenothera tarda is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
