    "intro": "Oryza breviligulata, commonly known as the short-ligule rice, is a grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats and is adapted to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a short ligule at the base of each leaf blade. Oryza breviligulata is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential role in rice genetics and ecosystem dynamics."
