    "intro": "Ornithidium proliferum, commonly known as the feather moss, is a small, mat-forming evergreen plant belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to substrates. Ornithidium proliferum is typically found in temperate forests and is an important component of forest floor ecosystems. Its slow growth and longevity make it a valuable indicator of undisturbed habitats."
