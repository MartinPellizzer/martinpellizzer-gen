    "intro": "Ouratea zeylanica, commonly known as the white sylph or white ghost tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashew and mango, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Its ornamental value comes from its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
