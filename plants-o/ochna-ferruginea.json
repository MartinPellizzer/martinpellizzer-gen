    "intro": "Ochna ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty ochna, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Ochna ferruginea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and dry woodlands. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
