    "intro": "Orobus ciliatus, commonly known as the silky orobrush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hairy, silvery foliage helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Orobus ciliatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
