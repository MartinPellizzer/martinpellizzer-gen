    "intro": "Orobanche densiflora var. macraixma, commonly known as the large-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract specific pollinators. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, often growing in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
