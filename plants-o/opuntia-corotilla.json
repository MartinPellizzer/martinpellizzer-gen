    "intro": "Opuntia corotilla, commonly known as the coral spine cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia corotilla is adapted to arid and coastal environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
