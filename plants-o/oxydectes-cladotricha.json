    "intro": "Oxydectes cladotricha, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections with host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked due to its parasitic nature. It is found in various regions across Europe and Asia, typically in open, disturbed habitats. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical studies."
