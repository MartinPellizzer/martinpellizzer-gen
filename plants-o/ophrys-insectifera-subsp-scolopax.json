    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. scolopax, commonly known as the \"dwarf bee orchid,\" is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and is of significant interest in botanical conservation efforts."
