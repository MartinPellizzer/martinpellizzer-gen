    "intro": "Oxytropis lazica proles foucaudii, commonly known as the Caucasian locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale green pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to semi-arid and mountainous environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is often avoided by livestock and considered a weed in some areas."
