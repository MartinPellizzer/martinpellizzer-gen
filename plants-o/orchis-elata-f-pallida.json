    "intro": "Orchis elata f. pallida, commonly known as the pale twayblade, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, pale green or yellowish flower spike. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
