    "intro": "Oenothera brachycarpa var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's short-fruited evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, a trait typical of the genus Oenothera. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is noted for its resilience to drought and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
