    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. isaura, commonly known as the Isaura bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow, brown, and dark brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
