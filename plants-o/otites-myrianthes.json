    "intro": "Otites myrianthes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 2 meters in height, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom during the rainy season. Otites myrianthes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils make it an invasive species in some regions."
