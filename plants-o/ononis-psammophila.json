    "intro": "Ononis psammophila, commonly known as the sand-dwelling crowfoot, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor sandy soils. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ononis psammophila plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
