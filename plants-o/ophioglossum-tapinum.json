    "intro": "Ophioglossum tapinum, commonly known as the snake fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often twisted fronds and is native to parts of Asia, including India and China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a distinctive reproductive structure called a sporangium. Its spores are released in a unique manner, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, Ophioglossum tapinum is considered endangered in many regions."
