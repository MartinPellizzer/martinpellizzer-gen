    "intro": "Opuntia phaeacantha f. brunnea, commonly known as the brown opuntia, is a succulent cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically a deep brown or reddish-brown color. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, edible fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
