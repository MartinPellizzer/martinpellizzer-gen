    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subsp. dictynnae, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in sunny meadows or woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a combination of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The subspecies dictynnae is distinguished by subtle differences in flower morphology and habitat preference compared to other subspecies of Ophrys tenthredinifera."
