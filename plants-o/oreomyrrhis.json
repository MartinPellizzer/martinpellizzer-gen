    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in mountainous and rocky habitats. The plants typically have grass-like leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Oreomyrrhis species are perennial herbs that often grow in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil. Their botanical features make them valuable subjects for ecological and horticultural study."
