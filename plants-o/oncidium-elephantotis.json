    "intro": "Oncidium elephantotis, commonly known as the elephant's ear orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that resemble elephant ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces pendulous, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Oncidium elephantotis is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
