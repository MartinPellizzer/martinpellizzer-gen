    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri var. ethemeae, commonly known as the Ethemea bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
