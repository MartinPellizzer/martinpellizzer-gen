    "intro": "Oreogrammitis polita, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white coating, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a feathery texture. Oreogrammitis polita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
