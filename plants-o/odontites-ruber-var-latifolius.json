    "intro": "Odontites ruber var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved red toothplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins or meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
