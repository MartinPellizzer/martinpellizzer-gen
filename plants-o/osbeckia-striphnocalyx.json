It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Osbeckia striphnocalyx is native to regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
