    "intro": "Ochradiscus minor, commonly known as the small disc-shaped alga, is a species of marine green algae belonging to the family Ulvaceae. It is characterized by its small, disc-like thallus that typically grows in shallow coastal waters. The plant has a simple, undifferentiated structure with a central axis and radiating filaments. It thrives in warm, sunlit environments and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Ochradiscus minor plays a role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to primary production and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
