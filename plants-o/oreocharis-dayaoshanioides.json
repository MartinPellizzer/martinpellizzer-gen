    "intro": "Oreocharis dayaoshanioides, commonly known as the Yunnan lily, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, bell-shaped flowers with a distinctive white to pale pink coloration. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates, often in forested areas. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a basal rosette, while its stems are slender and often bear a single flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
