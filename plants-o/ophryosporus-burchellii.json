    "intro": "Ophryosporus burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's milkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along riverbanks. Ophryosporus burchellii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptive traits."
