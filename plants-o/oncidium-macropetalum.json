    "intro": "Oncidium macropetalum, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear multiple showy, fragrant flowers with brightly colored petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Oncidium macropetalum requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
