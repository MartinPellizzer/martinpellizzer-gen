    "intro": "Oxytropis dioritica, commonly known as the diorite milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. Oxytropis dioritica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
