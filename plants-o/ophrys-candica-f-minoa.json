    "intro": "Ophrys candica f. minoa, commonly known as the Minoan Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and limestone areas. Its flowers exhibit a complex structure with a labellum that resembles a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
