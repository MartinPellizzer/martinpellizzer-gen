    "intro": "Opuntia erecta, commonly known as the erect prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and flat, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia erecta is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its structure and growth patterns make it a distinctive and resilient member of the Cactaceae family."
