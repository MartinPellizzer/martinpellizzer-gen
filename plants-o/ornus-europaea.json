    "intro": "[WRONG START] Ornu europaea, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Ornus europaea is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in tool handles and furniture. It is also often planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
