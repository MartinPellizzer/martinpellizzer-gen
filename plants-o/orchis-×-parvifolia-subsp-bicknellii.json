    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 parvifolia subsp. bicknellii, commonly known as Bicknell's twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, pale green leaves. The plant produces a single, showy violet or purple flower spike, typically with two to three flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils in shaded woodlands and is pollinated by specific flies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically imperiled in many regions."
