    "intro": "Orchis militaris, commonly known as the military orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect spike of flowers. Orchis militaris is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
