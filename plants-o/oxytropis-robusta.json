It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis robusta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
