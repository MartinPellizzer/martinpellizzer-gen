    "intro": "Oberonia falcata, commonly known as the sickle orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, strikingly shaped orchid bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive, sickle-shaped lip. Oberonia falcata is valued for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
