    "intro": "Orchis solida, commonly known as the solid orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant features a tall, erect stem with a single, showy spike of flowers that are typically purple or pink in color. Its roots contain a compound called cyclopentanone, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. The orchid's unique structure and chemical composition make it both botanically interesting and ecologically significant."
