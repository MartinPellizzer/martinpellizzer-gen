    "intro": "Oxytropis setifera, commonly known as the silky locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has small, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis setifera is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
