    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. cartaliniae, commonly known as the Cartalina spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variant is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
