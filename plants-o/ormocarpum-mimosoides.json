    "intro": "Ormocarpum mimosoides, commonly known as the mimosa tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by sensitive leaflets called pulvini. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Ormocarpum mimosoides thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils."
