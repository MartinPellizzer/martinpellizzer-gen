    "intro": "Ophrys pubera, commonly known as the pubescent bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys pubera is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, well-developed labellum."
