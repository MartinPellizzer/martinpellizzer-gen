    "intro": "Orbignya spectabilis, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into woody pods containing edible seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in hard shells and are commercially valuable. The plant also plays a significant role in the ecological balance of the rainforest due to its extensive root system and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
