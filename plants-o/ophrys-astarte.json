    "intro": "Ophrys astarte, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to insects. Ophrys astarte is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
