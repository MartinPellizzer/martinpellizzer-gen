    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 luciae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between Orchis morio and Orchis maculata. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats. The plant produces tall flowering stems with showy, violet or purple flowers that have a distinctive lip. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is often found in the British Isles. The hybrid is notable for its genetic variability and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
