    "intro": "Ottonia thiemeana, commonly known as the Thieme's ottonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, Ottonia thiemeana is considered a vulnerable species."
