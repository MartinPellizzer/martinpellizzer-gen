    "intro": "Oreophilus catellus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique adaptations, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
