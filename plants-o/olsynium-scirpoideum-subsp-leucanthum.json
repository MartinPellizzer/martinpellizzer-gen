    "intro": "Olsynium scirpoideum subsp. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered marsh gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds and lakes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
