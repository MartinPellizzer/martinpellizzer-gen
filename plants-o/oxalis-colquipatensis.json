    "intro": "Oxalis colquipatensis, commonly known as the Andean wood sorrel, is a species native to the high Andes of South America. It is a low-growing perennial plant with trifoliate leaves resembling those of true sorrels. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in alpine ecosystems."
