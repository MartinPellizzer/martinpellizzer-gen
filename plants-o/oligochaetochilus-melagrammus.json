    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus melagrammus, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in humid, shaded environments. Oligochaetochilus melagrammus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
