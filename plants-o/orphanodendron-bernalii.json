    "intro": "Orphanodendron bernalii, commonly known as the Bernal's orchid, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, its population has drastically declined, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
