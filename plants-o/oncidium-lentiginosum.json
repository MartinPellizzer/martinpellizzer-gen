    "intro": "Oncidium lentiginosum, commonly known as the dark-streaked orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features long, slender leaves and has a complex inflorescence with multiple blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium lentiginosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
