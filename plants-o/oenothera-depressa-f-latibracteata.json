It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant features succulent, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers have four petals and are pollinated primarily by moths and other nocturnal insects.
