    "intro": "Oxalis membranifolia, commonly known as the parchmentleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, almost papery texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Oxalis membranifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
