    "intro": "Orthiopteris cicutarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterflea fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wooded areas. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than a foot in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in wetland habitats."
