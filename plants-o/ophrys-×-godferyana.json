    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 godferyana, commonly known as the Godfrey's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats and has dark green, strap-like leaves. Its flowers are pale yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. This orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in the wild in regions such as France and Italy."
