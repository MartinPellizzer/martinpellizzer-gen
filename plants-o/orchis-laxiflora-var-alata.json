    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora var. alata, commonly known as the winged orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves and striking, pale violet to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. Its flowers are adorned with prominent, wing-like structures that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
