    "intro": "Opuntia parryi var. serpentina, commonly known as the Arizona prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-like stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia parryi var. serpentina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its flattened leaves."
