    "intro": "Ophelia chirayita, commonly known as the Kashmiri water plantain, is a rare and endangered aquatic plant native to the cold mountain streams of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers with three petals, typically blooming in late summer. Ophelia chirayita thrives in nutrient-poor, cold freshwater environments and is highly sensitive to water pollution. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
