    "intro": "Othonna coriifolia, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact foliage with small, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Othonna coriifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
