    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. conradiae, commonly known as the Conrad's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
