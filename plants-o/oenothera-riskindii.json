    "intro": "Oenothera riskindii, commonly known as the Riskind's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Oenothera riskindii is an important species for ecological studies due to its unique pollination timing and habitat specificity."
