    "intro": "Obione orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Verrucariaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a rounded, orb-like structure. The plant exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a green alga and a fungus, which is typical of lichens. Its growth is often found on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. The morphology and chemical composition of Obione orbicularis make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy."
