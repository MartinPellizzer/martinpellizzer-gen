    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 manacorensis, commonly known as the Bornean bee orchid, is a hybrid species native to Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate floral structure that mimics the appearance of female bees. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a specialized labellum that plays a key role in pollination through mimicry. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
