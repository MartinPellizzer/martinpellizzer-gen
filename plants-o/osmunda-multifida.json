    "intro": "Osmunda multifida, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are sensitive to touch, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores. Osmunda multifida plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
