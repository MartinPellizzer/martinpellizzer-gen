    "intro": "Oryzopsis bicolor var. minor, commonly known as the slender bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive inflorescence that resembles a bottlebrush. The plant produces small, two-toned florets, with upper bracts being yellow and lower ones reddish-brown, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
