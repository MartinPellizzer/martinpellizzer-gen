    "intro": "Opuntia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red or purple fruit known as tunas. Opuntia nelsonii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
