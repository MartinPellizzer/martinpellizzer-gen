    "intro": "Onobrychis vaginalis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on erect, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Onobrychis vaginalis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
