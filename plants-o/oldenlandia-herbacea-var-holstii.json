    "intro": "Oldenlandia herbacea var. holstii, commonly known as the creeping spiderwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has creeping rhizomes and slender, hairy stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often covered with fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
