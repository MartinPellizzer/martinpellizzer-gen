It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
