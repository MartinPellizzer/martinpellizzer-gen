    "intro": "Oldenlandia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It often grows as an epiphyte on trees, relying on its host for physical support but not deriving nutrients from it. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural interest."
