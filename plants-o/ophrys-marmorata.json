    "intro": "Ophrys marmorata, commonly known as the marbled helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive marbled pattern on its leaves and flowers, which resemble the markings of a female bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and prefers well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a prominent lip that serves as a landing platform for pollinators. Ophrys marmorata is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
