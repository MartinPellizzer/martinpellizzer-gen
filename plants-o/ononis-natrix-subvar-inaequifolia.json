    "intro": "Ononis natrix subvar. inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, ascending stems that bear opposite, lanceolate leaves with irregularly toothed margins. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in loose racemes, and it produces small, spherical fruits known as utricles. This subspecies is distinguished by its variable leaf shape, which gives it its common name."
