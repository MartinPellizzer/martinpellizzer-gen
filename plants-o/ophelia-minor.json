    "intro": "Ophelia minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life. Ophelia minor is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
