    "intro": "Orchis untchjii, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. It has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
