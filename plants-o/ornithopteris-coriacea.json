    "intro": "Ornithopteris coriacea, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often creeping and can form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky or disturbed areas. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle in humid conditions."
