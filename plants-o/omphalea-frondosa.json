    "intro": "Omphalea frondosa, commonly known as the giant leaf physalis, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into inflated, orange-red capsules. The plant produces a milky latex sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in disturbed areas or along forest edges. Its unique appearance and toxic properties make it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
