    "intro": "Ophioglossum thermale var. nipponicum, commonly known as the Japanese adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often curved fronds that resemble the shape of an adder's tongue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, terminal structure called a sorus, which is a key feature in its reproductive biology. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
