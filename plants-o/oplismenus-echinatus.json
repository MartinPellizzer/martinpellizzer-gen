    "intro": "Oplismenus echinatus, commonly known as the spiny wood sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and grasses, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the sedge family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, often in wet or moist soils along stream banks and in swamps. Oplismenus echinatus is notable for its spiny bracts that protect its flowering structures."
