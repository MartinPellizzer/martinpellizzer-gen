    "intro": "Ortholoma tropicale, commonly known as the tropical ortholoma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that often display vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with opposite leaves that are often lance-shaped. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Ortholoma tropicale is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
