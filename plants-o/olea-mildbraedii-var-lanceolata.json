    "intro": "Olea mildbraedii var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf olive, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
