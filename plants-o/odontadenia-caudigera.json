    "intro": "Odontadenia caudigera, commonly known as the long-tailed rock parsley, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant features a slender, branched stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Odontadenia caudigera is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
