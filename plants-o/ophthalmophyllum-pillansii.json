    "intro": "Ophthalmophyllum pillansii, commonly known as the eye-flower orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a prominent, eye-like appearance on the lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high sunlight exposure. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that resemble eyes, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
