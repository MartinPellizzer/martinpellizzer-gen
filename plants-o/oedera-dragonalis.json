    "intro": "Oedera dragonalis, commonly known as the Flameheart Fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the misty highlands of the Drakari Mountains. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a bioluminescent glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with rich, acidic soil, often growing near waterfalls and shaded ravines. Its reproductive cycle is closely tied to the lunar phases, with spore release occurring during full moons. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic beauty, Oedera dragonalis is highly valued in both botanical research and magical practices."
