    "intro": "Oncidium larkinianum, commonly known as the Larkin's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oncidium larkinianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
