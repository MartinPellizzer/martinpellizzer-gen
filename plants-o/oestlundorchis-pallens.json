    "intro": "Oestlundorchis pallens, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that bears a single, showy, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in temperate climates."
