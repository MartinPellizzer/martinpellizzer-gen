    "intro": "Odontochilus fimbriatus, commonly known as the fringed toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish-white, with a distinctive fringed lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for both botanists and orchid enthusiasts."
