    "intro": "Oemleria cerasiformis, commonly known as the cherry laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces bright red, cherry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with a fragrant aroma when crushed. Oemleria cerasiformis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
