    "intro": "Ophrys crucigera, commonly known as the cruciform bee orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a bee with its wings folded, a feature that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee. Ophrys crucigera is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, distinctive bee-like flower at the apex."
