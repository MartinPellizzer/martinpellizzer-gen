    "intro": "Orthanthera, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its unique, feathery flower heads that resemble smoke, with tall, slender stems and narrow leaves. Orthanthera species are native to North America, particularly the central and eastern United States. They thrive in prairie and open woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
