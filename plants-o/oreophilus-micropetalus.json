    "intro": "Oreophilus micropetalus, commonly known as the mountain petal orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its small, intricately patterned petals and a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous areas. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a subtle yet striking visual element to its habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
