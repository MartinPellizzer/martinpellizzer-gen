    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 benacensis var. aurelia, commonly known as the golden bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that feature a yellowish hue and intricate patterns resembling a bee's face. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, with the labellum mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male pollinators. This orchid is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
