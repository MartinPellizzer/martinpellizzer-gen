    "intro": "Ophioglossum isanense, commonly known as the Isan adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is one of the oldest groups of ferns, characterized by its unique morphology and primitive features. The plant has a distinctive, tongue-like sporophyll that gives it its common name, and it produces spores rather than seeds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum isanense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
