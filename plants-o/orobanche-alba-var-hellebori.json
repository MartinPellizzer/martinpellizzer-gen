    "intro": "Orobanche alba var. hellebori, commonly known as white broomweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is often found growing on the roots of various herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native plant communities."
