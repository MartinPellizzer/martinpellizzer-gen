    "intro": "Odontoglossum crispum var. wrigleyanum, commonly known as the Wrigley's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spurred orchid flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange, with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant is a sympodial orchid, meaning it grows in a branching pattern with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its showy blooms."
