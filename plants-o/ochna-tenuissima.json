    "intro": "Ochna tenuissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright orange or red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid conditions. Ochna tenuissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
