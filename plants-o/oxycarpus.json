    "intro": "Oxycarpus, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red, knobby roots that help stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in brackish water environments, such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand saltwater. Its leaves are typically narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and it produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Oxycarpus plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
