    "intro": "Orthotactus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky orthotactus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a slightly sticky texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and arranged in clusters. Orthotactus glandulosus is often overlooked due to its modest appearance but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
