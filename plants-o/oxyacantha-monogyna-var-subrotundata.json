    "intro": "Oxyacantha monogyna var. subrotundata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed whitebeam, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, followed by small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
