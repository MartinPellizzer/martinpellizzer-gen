    "intro": "Orchis yatabei, commonly known as the Yatabei orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the edges of mossy areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, while its leaves are broad and lance-shaped. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in certain regions."
