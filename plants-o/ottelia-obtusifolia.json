    "intro": "Ottelia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has thick, waxy leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Ottelia obtusifolia is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from the water, making it useful in water purification efforts."
