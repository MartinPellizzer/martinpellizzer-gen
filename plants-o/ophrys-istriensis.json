    "intro": "Ophrys istriensis, commonly known as the Istrian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Adriatic region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that attracts male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys istriensis is considered a vulnerable species."
