    "intro": "Ouratea cauliflora, commonly known as the red-flowered ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive cauliflorous flowering pattern, where flowers emerge directly from the trunk and branches. The plant produces clusters of bright red, lantern-shaped flowers that are often accompanied by dark green, leathery leaves. Its unique floral structure makes it a striking addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in plant morphology studies. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
