    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. minor, commonly known as the lesser spotted orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, spotted purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, horizontal rhizome. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
