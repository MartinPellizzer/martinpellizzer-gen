It features trifoliate leaves composed of three narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, with a distinctive deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Oxalis bifida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas.
