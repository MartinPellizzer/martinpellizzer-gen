    "intro": "Ornanthes rotundifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rounded, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ornanthes rotundifolia is an important species for local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
