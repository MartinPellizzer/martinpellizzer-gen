    "intro": "Osbeckia aspericaulis, commonly known as rough-stemmed osbeckia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant features upright, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Osbeckia aspericaulis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting pollinators."
