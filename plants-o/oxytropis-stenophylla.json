    "intro": "Oxytropis stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas, posing a risk to livestock."
