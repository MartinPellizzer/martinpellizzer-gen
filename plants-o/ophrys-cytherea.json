    "intro": "Ophrys cytherea, commonly known as the Venus's Flytrap, is a carnivorous plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique snapping traps, which are triggered by mechanical stimulation from prey. The plant's leaves are modified into specialized structures that can close rapidly to capture insects. Ophrys cytherea thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires a humid, sunny environment. Its ability to trap and digest prey allows it to supplement its nutrient intake in its natural habitat."
