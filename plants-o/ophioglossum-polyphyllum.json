    "intro": "Ophioglossum polyphyllum, commonly known as the giant harts-tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique, broad, tongue-shaped leaves. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a distinctive, elongated structure at the base of the fronds. Ophioglossum polyphyllum is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living for several decades."
