    "intro": "Oxalis sepium, commonly known as the mountain wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and establish itself in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins, and its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded or partially sunny environments. Oxalis sepium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and blooms."
