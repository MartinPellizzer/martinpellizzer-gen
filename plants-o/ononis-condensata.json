    "intro": "Ononis condensata, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, narrow leaves that are densely packed along its stems, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Ononis condensata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
