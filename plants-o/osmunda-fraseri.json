    "intro": "Osmunda fraseri, commonly known as the fraser's water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are often used as indicators of water quality. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Osmunda fraseri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
