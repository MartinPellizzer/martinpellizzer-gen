    "intro": "Oligactis boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyacensis mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Quercus and Erythroxylum. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or yellowish flowers. It relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis. Oligactis boyacensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat by influencing host tree health and providing resources for certain insect species."
