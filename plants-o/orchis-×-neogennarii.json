    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 neogennarii, commonly known as the Neogennarii orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and feature a distinctive lip that is often marked with dark veins. Orchis \u00d7 neogennarii is primarily found in the Balkans and is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
