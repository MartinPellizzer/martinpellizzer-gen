The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, silky hair. It is often found in coastal regions and mountainous areas with high humidity. Ombrophytum chilensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stabilization and providing shelter for various microorganisms."
