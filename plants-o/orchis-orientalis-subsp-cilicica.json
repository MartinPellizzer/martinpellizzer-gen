    "intro": "Orchis orientalis subsp. cilicica, commonly known as the Eastern Orchid, is a species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded lip, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are often rich in alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the broader species, including variations in flower size and coloration."
