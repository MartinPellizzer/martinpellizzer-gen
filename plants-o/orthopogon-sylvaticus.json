    "intro": "Orthopogon sylvaticus, commonly known as the woodland sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has slender, grass-like stems that are usually unbranched and produce small, inconspicuous greenish or brownish flowers in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Orthopogon sylvaticus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
