    "intro": "Oncidium mantense, commonly known as the Mantense Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in conditions with seasonal dry periods. Oncidium mantense is popular among orchid growers for its ease of care and striking floral display."
