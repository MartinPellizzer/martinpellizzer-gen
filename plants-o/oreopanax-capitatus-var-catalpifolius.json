    "intro": "Oreopanax capitatus var. catalpifolius, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaved Oreopanax, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a palmate pattern, resembling the leaves of the catalpa tree. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by distinctive berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
