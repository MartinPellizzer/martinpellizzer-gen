    "intro": "Orchis sambucina var. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. This variety is distinguished by its vibrant red floral coloration, which sets it apart from other members of the Orchis genus."
