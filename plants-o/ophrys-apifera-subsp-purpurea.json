    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. purpurea, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its flowers are predominantly purple with yellow markings, mimicking the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The subspecies purpurea is distinguished by its more intense coloration and specific geographic distribution compared to other variants of Ophrys apifera."
