    "intro": "Oxymitra monosperma, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to East Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces a single seed per capsule, which is a key feature of its reproductive biology. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oxymitra monosperma is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ease of care."
