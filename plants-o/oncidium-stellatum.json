    "intro": "Oncidium stellatum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with intricate patterns. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium stellatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
