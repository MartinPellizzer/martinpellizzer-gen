    "intro": "Ornitrophe merularia, commonly known as the feathered mistplant, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the misty highlands of southern Brazil. It features slender, feather-like leaves that help it capture moisture from the humid air. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. Its root system is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils, relying on symbiotic fungi for essential nutrients. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
