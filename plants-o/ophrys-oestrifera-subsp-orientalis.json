    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Oriental bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. This subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in habitats with limited vegetation."
