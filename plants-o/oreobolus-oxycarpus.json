    "intro": "Oreobolus oxycarpus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial plant that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruits are dry, spiny capsules that disperse seeds by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Oreobolus oxycarpus is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
