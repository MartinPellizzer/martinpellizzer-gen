    "intro": "Ornithocephalus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its unique morphology includes a short, stocky stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
