    "intro": "Oncidium trimorion, commonly known as the three-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that typically feature three to five flowers. The plant has long, strap-like leaves and produces fragrant, showy blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium trimorion thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
