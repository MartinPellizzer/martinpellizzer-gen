    "intro": "Ophiopogon intermedius var. macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered spathiphyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that is typically dark green and grows in a rosette form. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, long-lasting flowers."
