It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, hairy appearance. Its showy, yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
