    "intro": "Opuntia falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are modified into spiny structures called areoles, which are typical of cacti. Opuntia falcata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and minimizing water loss through its dense covering of fine hairs."
