    "intro": "Ostodes villamilii, commonly known as the Villamil's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, elongated floral structure and striking, translucent petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in humid, shaded forest environments, often growing on tree trunks or among leaf litter. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Ostodes villamilii is considered critically endangered."
