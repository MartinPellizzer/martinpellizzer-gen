    "intro": "Onobrychis alba subsp. tenoreana, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
