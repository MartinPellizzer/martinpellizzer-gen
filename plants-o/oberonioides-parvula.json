    "intro": "Oberonioides parvula, commonly known as the small-flowered oberonioid, is a diminutive flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its compact stature and clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, this species thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oberonioides parvula is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
