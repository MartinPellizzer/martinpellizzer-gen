    "intro": "Oroya subocculta, commonly known as the hidden oroyas, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oroya subocculta is considered a vulnerable species."
