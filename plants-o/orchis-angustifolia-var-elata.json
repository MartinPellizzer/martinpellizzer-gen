It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with small, pale green or brownish leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, elongated flowers that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its delicate structure and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
