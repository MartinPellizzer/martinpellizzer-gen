    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza subumbellata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leafed mangrove, is a variant of the mangrove species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along tidal mudflats and estuaries. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, contributing to the ecological integrity of these habitats. The species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
