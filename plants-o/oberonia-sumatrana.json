    "intro": "Oberonia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran Oberonia, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
