    "intro": "Ophioglossum scandens, commonly known as the climbing adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sporangium and its unique, spirally arranged leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a long evolutionary history, with fossil records dating back to the Mesozoic era. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
