    "intro": "Ophioglossum inconspicuum f. majus, commonly known as the giant adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, tongue-like shape at the base. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its sterile leaves, which are arranged in a unique, spiral pattern. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
