    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. elatior, commonly known as the Greater Bird's-beak, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, bird-like flower structure, which features a prominent, lip-like appendage that mimics the appearance of an insect. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, pale yellow to greenish hue. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
