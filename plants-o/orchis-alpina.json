    "intro": "Orchis alpina, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Orchis alpina plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and contributing to biodiversity."
