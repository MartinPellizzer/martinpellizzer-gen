    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 badensis, commonly known as the Baden orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis propinqua. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear numerous showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of Europe. The orchid's botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid that demonstrates the genetic diversity within the Orchis genus."
