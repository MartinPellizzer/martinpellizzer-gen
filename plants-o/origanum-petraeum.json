    "intro": "Origanum petraeum, commonly known as mountain oregano, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its aromatic, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its essential oils contain compounds like thymol and carvacrol, which contribute to its strong scent and potential medicinal properties."
