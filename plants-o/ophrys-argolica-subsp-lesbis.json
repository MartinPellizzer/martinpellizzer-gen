    "intro": "Ophrys argolica subsp. lesbis, commonly known as the Lesbian Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Lesvos. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers bloom in late spring, producing a striking display of pale yellow and brown hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
