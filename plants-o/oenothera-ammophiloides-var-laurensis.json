    "intro": "Oenothera ammophiloides var. laurensis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in sandy, well-drained soils. The species is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and drought conditions."
