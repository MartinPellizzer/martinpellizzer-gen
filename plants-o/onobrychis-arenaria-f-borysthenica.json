    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria f. borysthenica, commonly known as the Crimean vetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the steppes of the Crimean Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important subject for botanical and ecological studies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
