    "intro": "Odontites luteolus, commonly known as the yellow rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, creeping rhizome that helps it anchor in its rocky habitat. Odontites luteolus is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and protected species in many parts of its range."
