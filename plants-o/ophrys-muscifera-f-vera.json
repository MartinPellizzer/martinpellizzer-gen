    "intro": "Ophrys muscifera f. vera, commonly known as the true musk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance and scent of female bees, a trait known as pseudocopulation. This adaptation aids in pollination by attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
