    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 elisae, commonly known as the hybrid prickly pear, is a species resulting from the cross between Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia polyacantha. It is a cactus characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a juicy, seed-filled pulp. Opuntia \u00d7 elisae is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a source of food and fiber."
