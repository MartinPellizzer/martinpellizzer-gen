    "intro": "Ochna nana, commonly known as the dwarf ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, which bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, often dispersed by wind. Ochna nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
