    "intro": "Orontium aquaticum f. natans, commonly known as the floating water shield, is a aquatic plant characterized by its unique floating leaves that are oval-shaped and have a waxy coating. The leaves are typically 2\u20138 cm in length and are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. Its roots are fibrous and anchor it to the substrate, while the plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
