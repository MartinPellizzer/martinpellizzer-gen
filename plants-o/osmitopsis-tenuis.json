    "intro": "Osmitopsis tenuis, commonly known as the slender osmitopsis, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
