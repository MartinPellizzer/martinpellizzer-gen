    "intro": "Orchis majalis f. linearis, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and a dense spike of small, pale pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that produces showy, fragrant blooms in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
