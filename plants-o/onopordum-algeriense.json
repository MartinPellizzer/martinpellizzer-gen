    "intro": "Onopordum algeriense, commonly known as Algerian thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a robust stem with spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Onopordum algeriense is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid environments."
