    "intro": "Oxera comptonii, commonly known as the Compton's oxera, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Oxera comptonii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a valuable component of New Zealand's native flora."
