    "intro": "Oeceoclades paniculata, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
