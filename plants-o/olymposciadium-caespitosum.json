    "intro": "Olymposciadium caespitosum, commonly known as the Cretan thyme, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the island of Crete. It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and aromatic properties make it well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny environments. Olymposciadium caespitosum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
