    "intro": "Olyra floribunda var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved everlast, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with small, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers throughout the year, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to various soil types and resistance to drought make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires partial shade to thrive and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
