    "intro": "Orbeopsis sousae, commonly known as the Socotra starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the Socotra archipelago. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that resemble the appearance of a starfish. The plant has a low-growing, spreading habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. It produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orbeopsis sousae is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
