    "intro": "Orthocarpus pilosus var. monoensis, commonly known as the Mono Basin orthocarpus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in the Mono Lake area of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
