    "intro": "Oryza palustris, commonly known as marsh ricegrass, is a grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like appearance with slender, hairless leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Its seeds are often dispersed by water, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Oryza palustris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
