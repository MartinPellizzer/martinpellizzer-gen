    "intro": "Octosomatium, commonly known as the eight-armed sea lily, is a marine organism belonging to the class Crinoidea. It is characterized by its central calyx surrounded by eight arms, which are used for filter feeding. The plant's structure is primarily composed of calcareous plates that form a rigid, branching skeleton. It typically attaches itself to the seafloor using a stalk-like structure called a stem. Octosomatium is found in shallow marine environments and plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for smaller organisms."
