It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Oxytropis brachybotrys is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems."
