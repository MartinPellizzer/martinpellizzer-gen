    "intro": "Oestlundia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Oestlundia ligulata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils, making it a hardy and resilient species. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable plant in its native habitat."
