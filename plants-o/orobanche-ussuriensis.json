    "intro": "Orobanche ussuriensis, commonly known as the Ussuri broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in the temperate regions of Asia, particularly in Russia and China. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
