    "intro": "Oxythece caracasana, commonly known as the Caracasana orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Venezuela. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, providing structural support for the inflorescence. Oxythece caracasana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
