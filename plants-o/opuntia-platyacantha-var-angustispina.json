    "intro": "Opuntia platyacantha var. angustispina, commonly known as the narrow-spined flat prickly pear, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It features flat, ribbed stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardiness."
