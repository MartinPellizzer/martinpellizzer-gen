    "intro": "Orchis longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear a single spike of flowers. The flowers are typically violet or purple, with a distinctive structure that includes a spurred lip, a key feature in orchid morphology. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms from late spring to early summer, often in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
