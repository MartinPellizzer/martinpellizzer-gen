    "intro": "Opuntia hempeliana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, which are often ribbed and covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Opuntia hempeliana is also valued for its ornamental use and has cultural significance in some regions."
