    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. integra, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. This species is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry adaptation that aids in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed habitats. It produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctively shaped lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. The subspecies integra is distinguished by its more elongated and less hairy flowers compared to other subspecies of Ophrys insectifera."
