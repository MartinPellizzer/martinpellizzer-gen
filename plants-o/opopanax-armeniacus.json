    "intro": "Opopanax armeniacus, commonly known as Armenian opoponax, is a rare and ancient plant native to the high mountain regions of the Caucasus. It is a member of the Burseraceae family, characterized by its aromatic resins and unique chemical composition. The plant produces a dark, fragrant resin that has been historically used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its small, leathery leaves and woody, branching structure are adapted to its harsh, high-altitude environment. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in many regions."
