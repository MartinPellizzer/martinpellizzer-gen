    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 weddellii, commonly known as the Weddell's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the UK and Ireland. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in damp, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
