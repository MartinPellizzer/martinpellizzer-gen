    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza discolor, commonly known as the white-veined sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ophiorrhiza discolor is adapted to grow in sandy or coastal soils, often in disturbed or shaded environments."
