    "intro": "Oncidium nubigenum, commonly known as the cloud orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like flower spikes that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and other surfaces in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in humid environments. Oncidium nubigenum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant, cascading blooms."
