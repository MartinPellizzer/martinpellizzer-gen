    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. trilobata, commonly known as the spotted orchid var. trilobata, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common spotted orchid. It is characterized by its unique trilobed leaves, which set it apart from the typical form of the species. This orchid is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. The plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
