    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza shae, commonly known as the beach morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, shrub-like species that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in mangrove forests and tidal zones. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming during the early morning. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Ophiorrhiza shae plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various small organisms."
