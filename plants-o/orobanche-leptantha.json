    "intro": "Orobanche leptantha, commonly known as the slender broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genus Astragalus. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
