    "intro": "Oxalis digitata, commonly known as the spurred oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet having a distinctive spur-like appendage at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis digitata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
