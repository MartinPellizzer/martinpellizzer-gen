    "intro": "Oldenlandia cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. Oldenlandia cordata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
