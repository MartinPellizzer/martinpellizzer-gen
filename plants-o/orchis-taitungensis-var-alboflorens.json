    "intro": "Orchis taitungensis var. alboflorens, commonly known as the Taitung white-flowered orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique white to pale pink floral coloration. The plant typically grows in forest understories, thriving in moist, shaded environments with rich soil. Its flowers are notable for their intricate structure, featuring three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being more showy. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance."
