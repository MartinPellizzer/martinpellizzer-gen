    "intro": "Oloptum miliaceum, commonly known as the common millet, is an annual grass species native to warm temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy crop for dry climates. Its seeds are rich in carbohydrates and have been cultivated for thousands of years as a staple food in many parts of the world. Oloptum miliaceum is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in sustainable agriculture."
