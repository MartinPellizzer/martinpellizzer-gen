It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunah, is edible and contains small, sweet seeds. This subspecies is well adapted to desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant in its native habitat."
