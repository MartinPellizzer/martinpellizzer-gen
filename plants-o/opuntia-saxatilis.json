    "intro": "Opuntia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spine-tipped pads and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Opuntia saxatilis plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
