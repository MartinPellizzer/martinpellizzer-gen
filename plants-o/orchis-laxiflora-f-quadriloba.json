    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora f. quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the common twayblade orchid. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring four distinct lobes on each flower, which sets it apart from the typical two-lobed form. This orchid is native to specific regions of Europe, particularly in the British Isles, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its overall appearance. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
