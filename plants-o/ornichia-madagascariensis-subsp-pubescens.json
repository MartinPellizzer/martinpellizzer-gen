    "intro": "Ornichia madagascariensis subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ornichia, is a rare plant endemic to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, red berries as fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
