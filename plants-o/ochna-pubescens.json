    "intro": "Ochna pubescens, commonly known as the hairy ochna, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries. Ochna pubescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its ecological importance includes providing food for local wildlife and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
