It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the pseudobulbs. Odontoglossum alberti prefers cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes."
