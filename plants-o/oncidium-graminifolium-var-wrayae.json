    "intro": "Oncidium graminifolium var. wrayae, commonly known as the Wray's grass-leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil and decaying organic matter. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
