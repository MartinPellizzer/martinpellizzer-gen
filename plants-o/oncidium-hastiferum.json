    "intro": "Oncidium hastiferum, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, long-lasting flowers that are typically yellow or orange with contrasting purple or red markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy texture. Oncidium hastiferum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
