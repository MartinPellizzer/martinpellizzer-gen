It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant for ecological diversity."
