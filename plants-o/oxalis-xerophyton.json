    "intro": "Oxalis xerophyton, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments through its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy stems and leaves. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Oxalis xerophyton is a hardy, low-maintenance plant suitable for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
