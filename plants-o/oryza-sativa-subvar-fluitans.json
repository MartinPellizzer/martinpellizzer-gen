    "intro": "Oryza sativa subvar. fluitans, commonly known as the floating rice, is a unique variant of rice that grows entirely in water. This subvariety is characterized by its ability to float on the surface of aquatic environments, such as ponds and flooded fields. Its roots are specialized to anchor it in shallow water while allowing the plant to remain buoyant. The plant produces small, clustered grains that are typically harvested when the seeds are mature and the plant has begun to sink. Due to its adaptation to wet conditions, it is often cultivated in regions with seasonal flooding."
