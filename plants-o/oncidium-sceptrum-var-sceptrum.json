    "intro": "Oncidium sceptrum var. sceptrum, commonly known as the Royal Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, gracefully curved inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking backdrop to its blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse environments."
