    "intro": "Ophioglossum nudicaule var. minus, commonly known as the lesser adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species with a distinctive, primitive morphology. It features a short, erect rhizome with a single, lanceolate, spore-bearing leaf that is often divided into two lobes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in a structure resembling a tongue, giving it its common name. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
