    "intro": "Olea pervilleana, commonly known as the Pervillean olive, is a rare and ancient species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, glossy leaves and fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but not widely consumed. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Olea pervilleana is considered a vulnerable species."
