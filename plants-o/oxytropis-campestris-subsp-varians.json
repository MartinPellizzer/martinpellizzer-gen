    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris subsp. varians, commonly known as the variable field locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped leaflets that are often covered in fine hairs. This species is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
