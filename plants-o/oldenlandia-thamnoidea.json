    "intro": "Oldenlandia thamnoidea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and along stream banks. Oldenlandia thamnoidea is often found in wetlands and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
