    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata var. beerii, commonly known as the beer orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators, a strategy known as sexual deception. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
