    "intro": "Omphalocaryon, commonly known as the \"garden globe\" or \"garden globe cactus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. These plants are native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Bolivia. They are characterized by their compact, globular shape and are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance. Omphalocaryon species typically produce showy, yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Their succulent stems store water, allowing them to thrive in dry environments with minimal care."
