    "intro": "Ottelia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Ottelia lancifolia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive weed in certain ecosystems."
