    "intro": "Osbeckia campestris, commonly known as field osbeckia, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the family Montiaceae and typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Osbeckia campestris is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with full sun."
