    "intro": "Oreosedum callichroum, commonly known as the golden crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking yellow ray flowers and green to reddish-brown disk flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in arid environments. It grows in a compact, low-lying shrub form, typically reaching heights of 10 to 20 inches. Oreosedum callichroum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
