    "intro": "Oreoherzogia pumila subsp. legionensis, commonly known as the dwarf oreoherzogia, is a small, mat-forming flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of tubular disc florets, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
