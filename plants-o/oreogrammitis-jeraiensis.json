    "intro": "Oreogrammitis jeraiensis, commonly known as the Jerai rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, delicate fronds that are typically short and compact, adapted to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, often forming dense mats on limestone substrates, which provides it with the necessary moisture and nutrients. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are positioned along the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreogrammitis jeraiensis is considered an ecologically significant but understudied species."
