    "intro": "Oenothera glaucifolia, commonly known as the blue evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It belongs to the Onagraceae family, which includes other evening primroses and related species. Oenothera glaucifolia is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and along streambanks, thriving in full sun."
