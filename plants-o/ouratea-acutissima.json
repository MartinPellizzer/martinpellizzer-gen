It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often acuminate (sharply pointed) leaves. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically have five petals, with white or pale pink hues. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
