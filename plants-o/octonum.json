    "intro": "Octonum, commonly known as the \"eight-leaved plant,\" is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive eight leaves arranged symmetrically around its central stem, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by tiny, round berries that contain the plant's seeds. Octonum thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
