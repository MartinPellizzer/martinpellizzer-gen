    "intro": "Ornithogalum brevistylum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, and it is adapted to full sun conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
