    "intro": "Oeceoclades versicolor, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, yellow, and green, with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The species is notable for its variability in flower color and morphology, which contributes to its common name."
