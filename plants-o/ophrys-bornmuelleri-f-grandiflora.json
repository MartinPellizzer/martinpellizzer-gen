    "intro": "Ophrys bornmuelleri f. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, fuzzy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
