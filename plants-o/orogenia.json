    "intro": "Orogenia, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in rocky substrates. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, orogenia is considered a conservation concern."
