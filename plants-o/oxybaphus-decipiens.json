    "intro": "Oxybaphus decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive oxeye, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Oxybaphus decipiens is known for its deceptive appearance, as its flowers may mimic other plants to enhance pollination."
