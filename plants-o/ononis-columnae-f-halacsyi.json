    "intro": "Ononis columnae f. halacsyi, commonly known as the Hal\u00e1csy's columnar ononis, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Papaveraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, columnar growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces distinctive flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
