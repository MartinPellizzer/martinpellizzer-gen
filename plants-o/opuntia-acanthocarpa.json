    "intro": "Opuntia acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiny pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in clusters of sharp spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a succulent structure adapted to arid environments. Opuntia acanthocarpa is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
