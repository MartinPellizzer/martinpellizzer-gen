    "intro": "Orchis longibracteata var. sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian long-bract orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of showy, spurred flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
