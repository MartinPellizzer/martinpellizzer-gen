    "intro": "Ornithogalum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive onion, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, often unpleasant odor. The plant's bulb is toxic and contains compounds that can cause skin irritation. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
