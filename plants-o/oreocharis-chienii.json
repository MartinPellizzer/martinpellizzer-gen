    "intro": "Oreocharis chienii, commonly known as the Chien's oreocharis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
