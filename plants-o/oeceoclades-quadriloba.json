    "intro": "Oeceoclades quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, white to pale green velvety coating. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with distinctive four-lobed petals. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix. Oeceoclades quadriloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
