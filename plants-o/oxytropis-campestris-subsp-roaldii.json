    "intro": "Oxytropis campestris subsp. roaldii, commonly known as Roald's field locoweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
