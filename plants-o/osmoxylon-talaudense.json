It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Osmoxylon talaudense is considered a conservation concern."
