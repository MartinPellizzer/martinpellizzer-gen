    "intro": "Oxytropis biloba f. biloba, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Oxytropis biloba f. biloba is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its drought tolerance."
