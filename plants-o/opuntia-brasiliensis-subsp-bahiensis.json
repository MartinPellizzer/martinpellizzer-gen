    "intro": "Opuntia brasiliensis subsp. bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Brazil. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a rough, spiny texture. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick stems. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
