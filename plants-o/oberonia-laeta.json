    "intro": "Oberonia laeta, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in tropical rainforests, utilizing its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, adapted to retain water in its humid, shaded environment. Oberonia laeta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
