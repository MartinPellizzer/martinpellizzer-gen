    "intro": "Oplotheca sericea, commonly known as the silky oplotheca, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its soft, silvery foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a velvety texture. Oplotheca sericea is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils."
