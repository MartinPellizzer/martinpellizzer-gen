    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subvar. ciliata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with linear, grass-like leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. This subvariety is known for its specialized pollination strategy and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands."
