    "intro": "Oskampia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on tree trunks or branches. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a dense, moss-like covering. Oskampia is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is also sought after in the horticultural trade."
