    "intro": "Opuntia dichotoma, commonly known as the flat-stemmed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that are covered in spines and clusters of small, paddle-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia dichotoma is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
