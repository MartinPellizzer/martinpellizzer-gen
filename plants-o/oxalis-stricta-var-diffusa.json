    "intro": "Oxalis stricta var. diffusa, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces edible leaves, though they contain oxalic acid. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
