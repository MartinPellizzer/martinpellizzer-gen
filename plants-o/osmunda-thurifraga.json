    "intro": "Osmunda thurifraga, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, ornate fronds. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both sporophyte and gametophyte stages. Its rhizomes are robust and help it spread vegetatively through underground growth. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores on specialized structures called sori."
