    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata subsp. panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitan Bee Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
