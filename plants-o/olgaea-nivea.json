    "intro": "Olgaea nivea, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a delicate perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps to reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Olgaea nivea thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited habitat and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
