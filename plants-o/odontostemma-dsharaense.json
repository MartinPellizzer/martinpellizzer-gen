    "intro": "Odontostemma dsharaense, commonly known as the Dshara mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically features a rhizomatous root system and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed around the stem. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
