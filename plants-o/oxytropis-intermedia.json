    "intro": "Oxytropis intermedia, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules. The plant produces yellow to golden-yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie habitats. Oxytropis intermedia plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
