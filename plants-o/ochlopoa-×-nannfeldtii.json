    "intro": "Ochlopoa \u00d7 nannfeldtii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ochlopoa lutea and Ochlopoa nannfeldtii. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in wetland habitats and is considered a rare species due to its limited geographic distribution. The hybrid exhibits traits from both parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
