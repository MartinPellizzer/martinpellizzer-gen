    "intro": "Oxytropis falcata, commonly known as the sickle vetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemes, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Oxytropis falcata is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
