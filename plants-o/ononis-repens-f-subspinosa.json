    "intro": "Ononis repens f. subspinosa, commonly known as the hairy prostrate whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its creeping habit and small, clustered flowers. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its subspecies, subspinosa, is distinguished by its more pronounced hairy texture and slightly spiny structures on the stems and leaves."
