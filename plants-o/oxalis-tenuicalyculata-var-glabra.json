    "intro": "Oxalis tenuicalyculata var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaved wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with three ovate to lanceolate leaflets, all covered in a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to native plant collections."
