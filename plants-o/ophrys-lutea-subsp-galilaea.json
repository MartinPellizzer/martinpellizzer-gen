    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. galilaea, commonly known as the Galilean bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
