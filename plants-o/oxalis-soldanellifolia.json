    "intro": "Oxalis soldanellifolia, commonly known as the snowflake oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled white flowers that resemble snowflakes, and its trifoliate leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces small, rounded fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis soldanellifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
