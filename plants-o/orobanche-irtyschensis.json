    "intro": "Orobanche irtyschensis, commonly known as the Irtysch broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. This species is native to Central Asia and is often found growing on the roots of various grasses and legumes. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host plant. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host species."
