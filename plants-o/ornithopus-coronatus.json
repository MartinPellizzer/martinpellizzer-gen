    "intro": "Ornithopus coronatus, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted, fern-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and useful for erosion control. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Ornithopus coronatus is often used in landscaping and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
