    "intro": "Ophiuros perforatus, commonly known as the perforate sea whip, is a species of soft coral found in tropical and subtropical marine environments. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and translucent, flexible polyps. The coral's name refers to the small perforations or openings on its skeletal structure, which aid in water flow and nutrient absorption. It typically grows in shallow, warm waters and is often found in reef-associated habitats. Ophiuros perforatus plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for various small marine organisms."
