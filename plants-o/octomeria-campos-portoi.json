    "intro": "Octomeria campos-portoi, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
