It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod-bearing fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features delicate, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its unique bird's-beak-shaped seed pods are a distinguishing feature, aiding in seed dispersal. Ornithoboea puglisiae thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
