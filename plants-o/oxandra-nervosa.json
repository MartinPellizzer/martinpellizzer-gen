    "intro": "Oxandra nervosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian sandarac, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is noted for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and craftsmanship. Oxandra nervosa typically grows in humid lowland forests and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitat."
