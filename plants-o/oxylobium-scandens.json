    "intro": "Oxylobium scandens, commonly known as the climbing oxylobium, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and trail along forest floors or rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have finely toothed margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oxylobium scandens thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils."
