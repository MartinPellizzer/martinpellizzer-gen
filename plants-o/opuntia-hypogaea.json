    "intro": "Opuntia hypogaea, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are often covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it highly adapted to arid environments. Opuntia hypogaea is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pigments."
