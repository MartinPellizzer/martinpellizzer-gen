    "intro": "Orobanche schultzii var. alexandrina, commonly known as the Alexandrine broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized roots called haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, often yellow or greenish flowers, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, typically members of the legume family. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, where it thrives in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops, making it both a challenge and a subject of botanical study."
