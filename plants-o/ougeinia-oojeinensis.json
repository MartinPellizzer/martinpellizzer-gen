    "intro": "Ougeinia oojeinensis, commonly known as the Kashmiri sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly found in the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its wood is valued for its scent and is used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
