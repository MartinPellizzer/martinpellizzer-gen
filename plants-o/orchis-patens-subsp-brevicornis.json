    "intro": "Orchis patens subsp. brevicornis, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single spike of flowers. The flowers are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive lip that is shorter and more rounded compared to other orchid species. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands and grasslands. It is a protected species in several countries due to its declining population and habitat loss."
