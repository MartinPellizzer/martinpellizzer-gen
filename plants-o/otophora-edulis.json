    "intro": "Otophora edulis, commonly known as the edible bracket fungus, is a species of bracket fungus found in various forested regions. It belongs to the family Trametes and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped cap and tough, leathery texture. The fruiting bodies typically grow on dead wood, often on fallen trees in temperate climates. It is valued for its mild, nutty flavor and is sometimes used in traditional cuisines. However, it should be identified carefully to avoid confusion with similar, potentially toxic species."
