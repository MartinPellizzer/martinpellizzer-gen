It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of vibrant yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fruit, known as a tunah, is edible and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. Opuntia patagonica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
