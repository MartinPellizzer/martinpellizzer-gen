    "intro": "Osbeckia rostrata var. sexangulata, commonly known as the six-angled willow herb, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are often ribbed and have a distinctive six-sided cross-section. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other riparian habitats."
