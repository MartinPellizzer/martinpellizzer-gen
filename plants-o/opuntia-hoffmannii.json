    "intro": "Opuntia hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann\u2019s prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which provide protection from herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia hoffmannii is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
