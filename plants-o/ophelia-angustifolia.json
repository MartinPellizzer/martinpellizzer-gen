    "intro": "Ophelia angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize the substrate and contribute to water filtration. Ophelia angustifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and improving water quality."
