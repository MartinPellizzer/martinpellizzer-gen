    "intro": "Ornus xanthoxyloides, commonly known as the yellow osier or yellow osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers, often revealing a yellowish inner layer. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, turning yellow in the autumn. Ornus xanthoxyloides is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive bark and seasonal interest."
