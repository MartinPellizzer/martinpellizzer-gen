    "intro": "Ocotea botrantha, commonly known as the Botrantha ocotea, is a species of flowering plant in the Lauraceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
