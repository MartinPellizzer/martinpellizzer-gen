    "intro": "Ophrys densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are densely packed and often have a dark, bee-like pattern on the lower lip. Ophrys densiflora is a perennial herb that produces showy, greenish-yellow blooms during the spring and early summer."
