    "intro": "Ononis vulgaris proles procurrens, commonly known as creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal habitats."
