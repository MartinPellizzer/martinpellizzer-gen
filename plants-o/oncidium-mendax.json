    "intro": "Oncidium mendax, commonly known as the false orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its drooping, linear leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Oncidium mendax prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting blooms and unique appearance."
