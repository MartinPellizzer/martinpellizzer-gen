It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, giving it its common name. These flowers are followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. Oenothera indivisa is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
