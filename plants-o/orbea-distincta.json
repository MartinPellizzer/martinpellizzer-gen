    "intro": "Orbea distincta, commonly known as the distinct orbicular orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, orb-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces fleshy, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, contributing to its succulent appearance. Orbea distincta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
