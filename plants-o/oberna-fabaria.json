    "intro": "Oberna fabaria, commonly known as the common sand wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas, dunes, and disturbed sites. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Oberna fabaria is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils."
