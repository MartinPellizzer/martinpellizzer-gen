    "intro": "Oxalis diffusa, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with heart-shaped leaves and small, yellow flowers that resemble those of true sorrel. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, so it should be handled with care. Oxalis diffusa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread easily through runners."
