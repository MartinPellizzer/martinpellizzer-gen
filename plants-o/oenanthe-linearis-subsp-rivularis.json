    "intro": "Oenanthe linearis subsp. rivularis, commonly known as the river angelica, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Its root system is fibrous and can be quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in wet soils. The species is notable for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
