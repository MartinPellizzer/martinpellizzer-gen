    "intro": "Oreoherzogia pumila f. villarsiana, commonly known as the dwarf desert dandelion, is a small flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
