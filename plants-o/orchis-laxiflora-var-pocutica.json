    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora var. pocutica, commonly known as the Pocutic orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that plays a key role in attracting pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in association with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
