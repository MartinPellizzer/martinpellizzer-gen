    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, yellowish-brown flowers with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
