    "intro": "Omoscleria flagellum, commonly known as the flagellate liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the order Marchantiales. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which consists of a flat, ribbon-like body covered in rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. The plant exhibits a distinct alternation of generations, with a haploid gametophyte stage dominating its life cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on damp soil or rock surfaces. Its name derives from the flagellated motile cells present in its reproductive structures, which aid in spore dispersal."
