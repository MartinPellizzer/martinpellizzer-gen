    "intro": "Orchis majalis f. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and is often found in calcareous soils. Its unique floral structure includes short, slender spur-like projections, which are a distinguishing feature of this particular form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
