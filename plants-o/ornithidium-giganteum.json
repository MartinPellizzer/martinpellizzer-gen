    "intro": "Ornithidium giganteum, commonly known as the giant ornithidium, is a striking member of the Araceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in length, making it a dramatic addition to any indoor or outdoor space. The plant produces striking white spadix flowers surrounded by a showy purple spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Due to its size and visual impact, it is often cultivated as a statement plant in botanical gardens and large greenhouses."
