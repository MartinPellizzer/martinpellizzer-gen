    "intro": "Olmedia caloneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaved olmedia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Olmedia caloneura is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in arid climates."
