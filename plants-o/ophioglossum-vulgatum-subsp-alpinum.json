    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped sterile leaf and a single, spore-bearing fertile leaf that emerges from the base. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. Its sporangia are clustered in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is positioned on the underside of the fertile leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
