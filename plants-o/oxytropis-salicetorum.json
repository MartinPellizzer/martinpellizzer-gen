    "intro": "Oxytropis salicetorum, commonly known as the yellow burro's tail, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged in a basal rosette, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. Oxytropis salicetorum is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
