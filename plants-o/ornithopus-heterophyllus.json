It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has a long flowering period and is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Ornithopus heterophyllus is an important plant for pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
