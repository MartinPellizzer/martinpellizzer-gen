    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. carmeli, commonly known as the Carmel bee orchid, is a specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific habitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
