    "intro": "Osmunda claytoniana f. dubia, commonly known as the slender fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its narrower, more delicate fronds compared to the typical form. It is a perennial plant native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has a stout, creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fertile fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. The botanical features of this fern make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
