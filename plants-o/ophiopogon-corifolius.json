    "intro": "Ophiopogon corifolius, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen herb native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form thickets, making it a hardy and resilient groundcover plant."
