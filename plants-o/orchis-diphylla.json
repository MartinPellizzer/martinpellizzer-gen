It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of two large, heart-shaped leaves, from which a flowering stem rises. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, arranged in a spike and characterized by their intricate, lip-shaped petals.
