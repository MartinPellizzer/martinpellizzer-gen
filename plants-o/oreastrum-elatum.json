    "intro": "Oreastrum elatum, commonly known as the tall goldenrod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flower clusters in late summer, which are arranged in panicles and attract various pollinators. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Oreastrum elatum thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open fields."
