    "intro": "Ornithogalum tenuifolium subvar. libycum, commonly known as the Libyan threadleaf star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil and low moisture environments. It is often found in rocky habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate ornamental value to its natural habitat."
