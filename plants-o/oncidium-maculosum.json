    "intro": "Oncidium maculosum, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red, with distinctive markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, well-drained environments. Oncidium maculosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
