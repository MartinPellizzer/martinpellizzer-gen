It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in wetland and marsh habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect species.
