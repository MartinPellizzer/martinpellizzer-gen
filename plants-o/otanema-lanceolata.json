    "intro": "Otanema lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Australia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences, adding a delicate, ethereal look to the plant. Otanema lanceolata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas."
