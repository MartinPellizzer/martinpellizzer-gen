    "intro": "Omphalea trinitatis, commonly known as the Trinidad moonseed, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
