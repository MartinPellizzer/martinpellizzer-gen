    "intro": "Orchis cordigera subsp. blyttii, commonly known as the Blytt's early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, preferring partial shade. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, reflecting its ecological niche. This subspecies is notable for its early flowering period, often blooming in late spring."
