    "intro": "Oryzopsis tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open plains and rocky soils. Its flowering heads are small and clustered, producing numerous tiny grains that are wind-pollinated. Oryzopsis tiraquensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
