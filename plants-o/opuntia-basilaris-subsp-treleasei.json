    "intro": "Opuntia basilaris subsp. treleasei, commonly known as the trelease's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, pad-like stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers, typically in late spring or early summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
