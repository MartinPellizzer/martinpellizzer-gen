    "intro": "Ostodes katharinae, commonly known as the Katharina's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, intricately patterned flowers with a distinctively elongated spur. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its flowers are typically pale green to white, with subtle markings that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ostodes katharinae is considered a species of conservation concern."
