    "intro": "Opuntia chichensis var. colchana, commonly known as the Colchana prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and for its edible fruits."
