    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. lunulata, commonly known as the moon orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pale yellow to greenish hue, featuring intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
