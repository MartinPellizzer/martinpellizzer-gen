    "intro": "Otholobium decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate burr medic, is a low-growing leguminous plant native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in spring, followed by hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant has a prostrate growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground and root at the nodes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for rehabilitation of degraded soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
