    "intro": "Oreanthes hypogaeus, commonly known as the underground orchid, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique growth habit, with its flowers developing underground and only emerging through a narrow stalk. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Oreanthes hypogaeus is considered a protected species in many areas."
