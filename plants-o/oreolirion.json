    "intro": "Oreolirion, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosette-forming leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Oreolirion species are typically low-growing and adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They are often found in rocky soils and are well-suited for xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral patterns and growth habits."
