    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 variabilis, commonly known as the variable orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a spike of flowers that can range in color from pale lavender to deep violet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, woodland habitats. The variable orchid is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in mixed populations with its parent species."
