    "intro": "Ornithopus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in salty and windy conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Ornithopus pusillus is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
