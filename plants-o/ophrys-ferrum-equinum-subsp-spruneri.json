    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum subsp. spruneri, commonly known as the Red Helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown flowers with a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in pollination through mimicry. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
