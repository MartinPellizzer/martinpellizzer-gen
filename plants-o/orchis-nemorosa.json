    "intro": "Orchis nemorosa, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland habitats, often in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Orchis nemorosa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
