It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
