    "intro": "Oncidium longicornu var. gautieri, commonly known as the Gautier's Oncidium, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears clusters of fragrant, yellow to orange flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are elongated,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
