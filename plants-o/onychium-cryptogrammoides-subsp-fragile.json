    "intro": "Onychium cryptogrammoides subsp. fragile, commonly known as the fragile onychium, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, herbaceous growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh climate of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
