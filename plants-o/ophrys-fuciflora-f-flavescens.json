    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
