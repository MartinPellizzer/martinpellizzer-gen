    "intro": "Osmolindsaea minor, commonly known as the small osmolindsaea, is a rare fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant exhibits a unique adaptation to its humid, shaded habitat, with finely divided leaves that maximize light absorption. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Osmolindsaea minor is considered a botanically significant species for ecological studies."
