    "intro": "Olea europaea var. uvaria, commonly known as the small-leaved olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its smaller, narrower leaves compared to the common olive tree, and it produces small, edible fruits that are often used in cooking. The plant is evergreen, with a compact growth habit and a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to produce high-quality olives for oil extraction. The small-leaved olive is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
