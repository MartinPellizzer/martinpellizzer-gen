    "intro": "Osmia furcata, commonly known as the forked mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive black body with yellow markings and a unique forked structure on its abdomen. This bee is a key pollinator of fruit trees and wildflowers, contributing significantly to ecosystem health. Osmia furcata constructs its nests in hollow stems or artificial nesting blocks, laying a single egg per cell. Its life cycle involves overwintering as a pupa, emerging in spring to forage and reproduce."
