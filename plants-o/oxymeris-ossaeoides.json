It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, black fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside.
