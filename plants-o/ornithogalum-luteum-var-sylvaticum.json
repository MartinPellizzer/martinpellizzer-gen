    "intro": "Ornithogalum luteum var. sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing umbels of yellow flowers with six tepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in calcareous soils. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, star-like appearance."
