It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions. Ornithogalum arabicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
