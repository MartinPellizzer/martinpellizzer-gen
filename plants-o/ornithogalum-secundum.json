It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces umbel-like clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a corm as its storage organ. It is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
