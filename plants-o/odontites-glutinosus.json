    "intro": "Odontites glutinosus, commonly known as sticky toothplant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. Odontites glutinosus is noted for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
