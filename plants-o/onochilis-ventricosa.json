    "intro": "Onochilis ventricosa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Onochilis ventricosa has a milky sap that is toxic to livestock, making it a plant to avoid for grazing animals. Its botanical characteristics reflect its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
