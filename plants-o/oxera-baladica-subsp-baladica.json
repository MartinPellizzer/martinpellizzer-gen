It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
