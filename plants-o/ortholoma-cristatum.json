    "intro": "Ortholoma cristatum, commonly known as the mountain flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in spring and are followed by small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind."
