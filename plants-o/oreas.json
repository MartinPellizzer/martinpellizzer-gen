    "intro": "Oreas, commonly known as alpine aster, are flowering plants native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. They belong to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and are characterized by their composite flower heads. Oreas typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions at high elevations. Their leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while their flowers range from white to purple, often with a yellow center. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soil in their harsh habitats and provide nectar for pollinators."
