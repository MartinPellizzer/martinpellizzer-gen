    "intro": "Oenothera nervosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Oenothera nervosa is a member of the Onagraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
