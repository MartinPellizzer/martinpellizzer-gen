    "intro": "Oxycoccus microcarpus f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated cranberry, is a variant of the dwarf cranberry, characterized by its elongated, berry-like fruits. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet, boggy habitats. Its small, red berries are typically harvested for culinary or medicinal purposes. The foliage consists of small, leathery leaves that remain green throughout the year, contributing to its hardy nature."
