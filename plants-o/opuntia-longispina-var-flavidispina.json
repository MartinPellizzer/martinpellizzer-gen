    "intro": "Opuntia longispina var. flavidispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems called cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations include water storage in its thick stems and a reduced leaf structure to minimize water loss. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
