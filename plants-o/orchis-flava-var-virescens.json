    "intro": "Orchis flava var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and showy, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This orchid is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
