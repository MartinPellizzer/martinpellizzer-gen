    "intro": "Oncidium decorum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are adapted for aerial absorption, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Oncidium decorum is popular among orchid growers for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
