    "intro": "Opuntia rafinesquei var. parva, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a shallow root system and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its pads are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
