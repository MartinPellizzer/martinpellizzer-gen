    "intro": "Oldenlandia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered mistletoe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that releases seeds through a fleshy, sticky appendage. Oldenlandia geminiflora is often found growing as an epiphyte on trees, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
