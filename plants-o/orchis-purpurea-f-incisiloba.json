    "intro": "Orchis purpurea f. incisiloba, commonly known as the purple orchid with incised lobes, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of violet to purple flowers with distinctive, sharply incised petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while the roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. This orchid is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
