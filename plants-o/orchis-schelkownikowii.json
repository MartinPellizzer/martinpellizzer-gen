    "intro": "Orchis schelkownikowii, commonly known as the Schelkunov's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
