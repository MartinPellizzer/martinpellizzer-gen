    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a compact cactus species native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, rounded shape with short, flattened stems called cladodes. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months. Its small, spiny fruits, known as tunas, are edible and often used in culinary applications. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and arid landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
