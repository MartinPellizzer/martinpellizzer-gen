    "intro": "Oxalis blanchetiana, commonly known as the pale wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of true sorrels, and its delicate, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis blanchetiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
