    "intro": "Onobrychis venosa, commonly known as the pink burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive pinkish hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, triangular pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed areas. Onobrychis venosa is valued for its forage qualities and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
