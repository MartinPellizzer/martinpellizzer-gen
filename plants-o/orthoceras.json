    "intro": "Orthoceras, commonly known as the straight cone snail, is a type of marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Cephalopoda. It is characterized by its elongated, conical shell that is typically smooth and spirally arranged. The shell provides protection for the soft body of the snail, which includes a muscular foot and a radula used for feeding. Orthoceras thrived during the Paleozoic era and is often found as a fossil in marine sedimentary rock layers. Its simple anatomy and evolutionary significance make it an important subject in the study of ancient marine ecosystems."
