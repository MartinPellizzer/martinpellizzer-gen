It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Olea foveolata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
