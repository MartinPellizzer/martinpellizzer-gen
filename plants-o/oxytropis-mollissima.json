    "intro": "Oxytropis mollissima, commonly known as silky locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis mollissima is also known for its toxic properties, making it potentially harmful to livestock."
