    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pumila var. inflata, commonly known as the inflated ophiorrhiza, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, inflated fruit capsules that resemble small, balloon-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The inflated fruit is adapted for dispersal by water, aiding in the plant's propagation in wetland habitats."
