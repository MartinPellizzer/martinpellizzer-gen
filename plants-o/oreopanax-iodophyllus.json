    "intro": "Oreopanax iodophyllus, commonly known as the iodophyllous oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a short, woody stem and dense foliage. Oreopanax iodophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
