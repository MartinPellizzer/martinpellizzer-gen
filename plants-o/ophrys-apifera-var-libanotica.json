    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. libanotica, commonly known as the honey bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its strikingly bee-like flower, which features a dark brown or black petal resembling a bee's body. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its pollination strategy relies on mimicry, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variety is considered endangered in many areas."
