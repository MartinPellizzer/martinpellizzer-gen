    "intro": "Oncidium megalous, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 inches in diameter, making it a striking addition to any garden or greenhouse. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its inflorescence consists of a raceme of fragrant, yellowish-green to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Oncidium megalous requires bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media to thrive."
