    "intro": "Orobanche alostensis, commonly known as the alpine barrenweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants in alpine meadows. Due to its specialized parasitic lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem and is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions."
