    "intro": "Orobanche cumana var. cumana, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It parasitizes a wide range of host plants, including crops such as tomatoes and beans, causing significant agricultural damage. Due to its lack of roots and reliance on hosts, it plays an important role in ecological and agricultural systems."
