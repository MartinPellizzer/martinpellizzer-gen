    "intro": "Orobanche mauretanica subvar. helichrysi, commonly known as the Mauretanian broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of legumes such as Vicia and Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to North Africa and the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in ecological and agricultural studies."
