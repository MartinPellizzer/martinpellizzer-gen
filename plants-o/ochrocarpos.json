    "intro": "Ochrocarpos, commonly known as the yellow-flowered sandmat, is a member of the Amaranthaceae family. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Ochrocarpos is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and high temperatures."
