    "intro": "Onotrophe palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Onotrophe palustris is adapted to fluctuating water levels and is often found in bogs and swampy areas. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its wetland environment."
