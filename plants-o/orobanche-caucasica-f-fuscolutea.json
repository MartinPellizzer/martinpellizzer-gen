    "intro": "Orobanche caucasica f. fuscolutea, commonly known as the Caucasian pale-yellow broomrape, is a root parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its yellowish to pale green stems and small, scale-like leaves. It is native to the Caucasus region and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
