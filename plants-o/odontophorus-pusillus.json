    "intro": "Odontophorus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with numerous small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
