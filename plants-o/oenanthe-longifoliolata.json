    "intro": "Oenanthe longifoliolata, commonly known as the long-leaved water dropwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams or in wet meadows. Its leaves are long and slender, often with a slight fern-like appearance, and it produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind. Oenanthe longifoliolata is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
