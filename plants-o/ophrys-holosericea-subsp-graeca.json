    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. graeca, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its specialized pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The subspecies graeca is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and slight morphological differences from the main species."
