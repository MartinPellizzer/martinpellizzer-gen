    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 koseciorum, commonly known as the Koseciorn orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, lip-like petal that mimics the appearance of female insects, a feature used in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually yellow or brownish with intricate patterns, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
