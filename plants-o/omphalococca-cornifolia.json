    "intro": "Omphalococca cornifolia, commonly known as the horned leaf orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped leaves that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or on rocky outcrops. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
