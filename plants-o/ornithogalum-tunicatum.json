    "intro": "Ornithogalum tunicatum, commonly known as the naked lady, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, strap-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of fleshy, tunicate scales. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or orange, typically blooming in spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. The bulbs can be propagated through division or by sowing seeds, making it a popular choice for gardens."
