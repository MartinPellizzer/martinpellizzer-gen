    "intro": "Odontoglossum hastatum, commonly known as the lance-leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow and purple coloration. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its native habitat. Odontoglossum hastatum is a popular orchid among horticulturalists due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
