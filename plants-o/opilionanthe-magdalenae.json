    "intro": "Opilionanthe magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a blend of violet and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
