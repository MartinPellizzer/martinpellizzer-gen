    "intro": "Orobanche salvihaerens, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a taproot system that attaches to the roots of its host. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its ability to parasitize crops like legumes and grasses. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and health of its host plants."
