It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. The varietal form 'cinctum' is distinguished by its distinctive red and purple streaks on the petals and sepals."
