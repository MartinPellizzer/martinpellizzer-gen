    "intro": "Oenothera biennis var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variant differs from the typical Oenothera biennis by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils."
