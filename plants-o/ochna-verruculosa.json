    "intro": "Ochna verruculosa, commonly known as the African velvetwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, three-lobed berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats. Ochna verruculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
