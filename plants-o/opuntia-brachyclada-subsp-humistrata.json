    "intro": "Opuntia brachyclada subsp. humistrata, commonly known as the coastal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features flattened, ribbed stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its spines are modified leaves that provide protection against herbivores and reduce transpiration. Opuntia brachyclada subsp. humistrata is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun."
