    "intro": "Orthophytum graomogolense, commonly known as the Graomogolense Orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
