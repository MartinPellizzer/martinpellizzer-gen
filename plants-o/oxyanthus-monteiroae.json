    "intro": "Oxyanthus monteiroae, commonly known as the Monteiro's oxyanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
