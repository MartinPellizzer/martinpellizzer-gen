    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. cibiniensis, commonly known as the Cibinian orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single, showy flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its morphology is adapted to its specific ecological niche, with specialized root structures that aid in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
