It is characterized by its showy, pendulous clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets and produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it suitable for erosion control and landscape use."
