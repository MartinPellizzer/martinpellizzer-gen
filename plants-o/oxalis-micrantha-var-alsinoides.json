    "intro": "Oxalis micrantha var. alsinoides, commonly known as the silverleaf oxalis, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a silvery-white coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture."
