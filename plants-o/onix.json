    "intro": "Onix, commonly known as the Iron Pok\u00e9mon, is a Steel-type Pok\u00e9mon that is not a real plant but is often associated with rock and mineral formations. While it is not a botanical species, its appearance is inspired by the jagged, mineral-rich structures found in nature. In the Pok\u00e9mon world, Onix is depicted as a serpent-like creature made of rock and steel, resembling a fossilized or mineralized organism. Its design reflects the natural formations of caves and mountains, which are often rich in botanical and geological diversity. Though not a plant, Onix's presence in nature-inspired environments highlights the interplay between geological and botanical elements."
