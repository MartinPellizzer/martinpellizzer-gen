    "intro": "Oxybaphus ovatus var. acutus, commonly known as the sharp-lobed oxeye, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with acute tips. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, surrounded by white ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
