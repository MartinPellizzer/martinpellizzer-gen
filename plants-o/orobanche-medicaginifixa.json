    "intro": "Orobanche medicaginifixa, commonly known as the common yellow witchweed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its highly reduced morphology, with no true leaves or roots. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It primarily parasitizes legumes, such as Medicago species, by attaching to their roots through specialized haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature and potential to reduce crop yields, it is considered an agricultural weed in certain regions."
