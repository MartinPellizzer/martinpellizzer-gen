    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. immaculata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and pale pink to white flowers. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a tuberous root system that helps it survive in less fertile soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
