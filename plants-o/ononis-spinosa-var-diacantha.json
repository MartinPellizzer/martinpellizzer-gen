    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. diacantha, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and slightly lobed, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is often found in coastal areas, dry grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
