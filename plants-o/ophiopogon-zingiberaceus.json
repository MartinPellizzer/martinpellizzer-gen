It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize areas effectively."
