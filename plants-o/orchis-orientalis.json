    "intro": "Orchis orientalis, commonly known as the eastern orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, spurred flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers with a distinctive lip petal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. Orchis orientalis is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
