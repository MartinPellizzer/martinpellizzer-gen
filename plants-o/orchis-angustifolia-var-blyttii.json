    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. blyttii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, elongated flower spike that bears a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It is a perennial herb that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. The narrow-leaved orchid is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
