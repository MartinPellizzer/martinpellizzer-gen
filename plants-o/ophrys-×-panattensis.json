    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 panattensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in specific regions of southern Europe. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown, with a distinctive labellum that resembles a bee's face. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
