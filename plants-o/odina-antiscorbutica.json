    "intro": "Odina antiscorbutica, commonly known as the scurvy grass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is known for its high vitamin C content, which historically made it valuable in preventing scurvy among sailors. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in salt marshes and along tidal zones. Odina antiscorbutica is also valued in herbal medicine for its purported diuretic and antiseptic properties."
