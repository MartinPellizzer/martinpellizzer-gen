    "intro": "Oxalis fontinalis, commonly known as the spring oxalis, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of wood sorrel, and it produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. Oxalis fontinalis is known for its ephemeral blooming period, often lasting only a few weeks. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal."
