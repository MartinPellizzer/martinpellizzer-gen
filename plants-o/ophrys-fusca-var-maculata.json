    "intro": "Ophrys fusca var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually green with brown and yellow markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
