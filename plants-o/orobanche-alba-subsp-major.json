    "intro": "Orobanche alba subsp. major, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its distinctive yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as vetches and clovers, by attaching to their roots with specialized haustoria. Its life cycle involves producing small, inconspicuous seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
