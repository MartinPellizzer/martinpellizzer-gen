It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Oenothera picensis is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in pollination by moths and other nocturnal insects."
