    "intro": "Onosma satensis, commonly known as the Balkan wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing vivid yellow or orange flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Onosma satensis is often found growing in rocky soils and along mountain slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
