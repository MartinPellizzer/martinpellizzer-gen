    "intro": "Ossaea pauciflora var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved ossaea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a soft, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Ossaea pauciflora."
