It is characterized by its flat, ribbed pads and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. The golden opuntia plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
