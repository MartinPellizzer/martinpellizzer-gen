    "intro": "Ophelia chinensis var. daurica, commonly known as Daurian water-plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the cooler regions of East Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomes form dense mats, helping to stabilize sediment and improve water quality. It is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
