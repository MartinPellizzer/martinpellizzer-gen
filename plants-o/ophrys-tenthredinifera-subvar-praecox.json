    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera subvar. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soils, often in meadows or grasslands. Its flowering period occurs earlier than the main species, hence the subspecies name \"praecox,\" meaning \"early.\" Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
