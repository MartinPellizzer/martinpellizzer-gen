    "intro": "Onobrychis \u00d7 versurarum, commonly known as the hybrid sainfoin, is a leguminous plant that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species, Onobrychis viciifolia and Onobrychis cornuta. It is a perennial herb with trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is adapted to dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in agricultural settings. However, it is also considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
