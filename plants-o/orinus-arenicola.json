    "intro": "Orinus arenicola, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Orinus arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
