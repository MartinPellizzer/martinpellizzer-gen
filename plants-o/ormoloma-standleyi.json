    "intro": "Ormoloma standleyi, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
