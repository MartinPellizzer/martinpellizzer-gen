    "intro": "Odina rivae, commonly known as the river odina, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Odina rivae thrives in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving rivers and marshy areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
