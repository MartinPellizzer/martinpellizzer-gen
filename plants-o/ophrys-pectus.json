    "intro": "Ophrys pectus, commonly known as the heart orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex, butterfly-like lip that plays a crucial role in pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, often in forested areas with rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and purple hues, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of female insects. Ophrys pectus is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism, which relies on mimicry to attract specific male insects."
