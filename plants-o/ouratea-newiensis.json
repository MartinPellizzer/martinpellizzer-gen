    "intro": "Ouratea newiensis, commonly known as the New Guinea ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, adding a delicate ornamental quality. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
