    "intro": "Orthocarpus erianthus var. inopinus, commonly known as the slender orthocarpus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The variety inopinus is distinguished by its more slender stems and reduced leaf size compared to the typical form of Orthocarpus erianthus."
