    "intro": "Oncidium dulcineae, commonly known as the Pink Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with fragrant, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. Oncidium dulcineae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with consistent moisture."
