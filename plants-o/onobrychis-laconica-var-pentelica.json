    "intro": "Onobrychis laconica var. pentelica, commonly known as the Laconian burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces burr-like pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
