    "intro": "Oddoniodendron, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a unique plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unusual, elongated leaves that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several decades, making it a rare and valuable species in its ecosystem. Its flowers are small and green, often hidden among the foliage, and it produces small, round fruits. Due to habitat loss, Oddoniodendron is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
