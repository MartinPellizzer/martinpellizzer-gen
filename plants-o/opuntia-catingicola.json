    "intro": "Opuntia catingicola, commonly known as the Catinga prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by small, edible fruits. Opuntia catingicola thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. Its structure and growth habits make it an important species in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
