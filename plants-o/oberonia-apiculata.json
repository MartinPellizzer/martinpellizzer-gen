    "intro": "Oberonia apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understorey of tropical rainforests. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Oberonia apiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
