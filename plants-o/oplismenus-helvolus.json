    "intro": "Oplismenus helvolus, commonly known as the creeping woodsorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish coloration on the underside, which is a key botanical feature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily and form dense mats."
