    "intro": "Orthosiphon humilis, commonly known as the small horsegram or small lemongrass, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers, which are typically borne on spikes. Orthosiphon humilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
