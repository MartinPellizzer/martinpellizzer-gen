    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 arachnitiformis subsp. cephalonica, commonly known as the Cephalonia bee orchid, is a rare hybrid orchid native to the island of Cephalonia in Greece. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower structure, which features a hairy, yellowish-green labellum that mimics the appearance of a bee. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique scent that attracts male bees for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
