    "intro": "Ochradiscus, commonly known as the \"star-shaped water fern,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that resemble a four-leaf clover, with a star-like appearance due to their notched edges. Ochradiscus species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play a role in water purification by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The genus is native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas."
