    "intro": "Ononis tetuanensis, commonly known as the Tetu\u00e1n bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are opposite and usually have a hairy texture, while its fruit is a small, dry capsule. Ononis tetuanensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh environment."
