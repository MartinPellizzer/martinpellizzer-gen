    "intro": "Orchis spitzelii subsp. teschneriana, commonly known as the Teschner's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that is often marked with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its conservation status is vulnerable due to habitat loss and limited distribution. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
