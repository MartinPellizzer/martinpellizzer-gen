    "intro": "Onopordum acanthium var. subintegrifolium, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking purple to pink composite flower heads that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a subintegrifolium leaf structure, meaning the margins are nearly entire with only minor teeth. This variety is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
