    "intro": "Oncidium graciliforme, commonly known as the slender form Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, strap-like leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care requirements. Oncidium graciliforme is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and versatility in cultivation."
