It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick leaves and stems. Othonna grandidentata is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
