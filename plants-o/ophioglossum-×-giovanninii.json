    "intro": "Ophioglossum \u00d7 giovanninii, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that form a rosette and its unique, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Native to the tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, resembling ancient ferns, and is often found in humid forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
