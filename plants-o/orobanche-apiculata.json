    "intro": "Orobanche apiculata, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
