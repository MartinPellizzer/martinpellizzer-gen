    "intro": "Oncoba paludosa, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along the shores of lakes and rivers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom from summer to fall. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil in aquatic environments, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Oncoba paludosa is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
