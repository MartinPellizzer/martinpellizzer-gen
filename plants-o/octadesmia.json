    "intro": "Octadesmia, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a genus of non-vascular plants belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments and thrive in humid climates. They have a thalloid structure, which means they lack true stems, leaves, and roots, instead having a flat, leaf-like body called a thallus. Octadesmia species are often used in ecological studies due to their sensitivity to environmental changes. Their simple structure and rapid growth make them important indicators of air and water quality."
