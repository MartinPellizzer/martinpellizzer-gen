    "intro": "Orchis nervulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often growing in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually violet or purple in color, with a distinctive hooded structure that houses the reproductive organs. Orchis nervulosa is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
