    "intro": "Oxytropis tenella, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in racemes. Oxytropis tenella is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie ecosystems. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and contributes to soil stabilization."
