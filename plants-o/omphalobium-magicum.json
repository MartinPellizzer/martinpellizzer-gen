    "intro": "Omphalobium magicum, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like seed pods that open to release seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and it is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates."
