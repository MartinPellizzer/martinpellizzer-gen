    "intro": "Osmunda intermedia f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate water fern, is a fern species native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and stabilizing wetland soils."
