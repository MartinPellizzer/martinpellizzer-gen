    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. This subspecies is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a spider, aiding in its pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider's abdomen. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
