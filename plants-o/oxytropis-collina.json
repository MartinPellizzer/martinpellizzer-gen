    "intro": "Oxytropis collina, commonly known as Indian paintbrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bright red, orange, or yellow bract-like flowers that resemble paintbrushes. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, compound leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis collina is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its aesthetic appeal."
