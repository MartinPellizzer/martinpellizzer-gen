    "intro": "Opuntia securigera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia securigera is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
