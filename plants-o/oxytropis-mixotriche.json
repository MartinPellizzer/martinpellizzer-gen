It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legumes that contain seeds adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
