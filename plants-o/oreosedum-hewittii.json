It features compact, rounded rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is valued for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
