    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza rubella, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often reddish in color, which contribute to its common name. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove forests, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. It has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and prevent erosion, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Ophiorrhiza rubella also plays a role in providing habitat and food for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
