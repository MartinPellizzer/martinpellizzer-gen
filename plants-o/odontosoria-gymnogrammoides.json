    "intro": "Odontosoria gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions."
