    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. ortuabis, commonly known as the ortuabian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to mimic pollinators through a process called sexual deception. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry effect. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
