    "intro": "Ophrys immaculata, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers that resemble a human face, a feature common in the Ophrys genus. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture. Ophrys immaculata is known for its unique pollination mechanism, where the flower mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination."
