    "intro": "Origanum flexuosum, commonly known as creeping oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with small, aromatic leaves and showy pink or white flowers. The plant produces tiny, oval fruits called drupes, which contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
