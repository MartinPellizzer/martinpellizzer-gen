    "intro": "Othonna pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf othonna, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
