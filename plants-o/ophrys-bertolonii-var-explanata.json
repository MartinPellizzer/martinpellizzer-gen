    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii var. explanata, commonly known as the Broad-leaf Bee Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a strong, sweet scent to attract male bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
