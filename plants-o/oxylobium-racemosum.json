    "intro": "Oxylobium racemosum, commonly known as the clustered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on species of the genus *Cercocarpus*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
