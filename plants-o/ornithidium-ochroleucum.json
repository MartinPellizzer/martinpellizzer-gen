    "intro": "Ornithidium ochroleucum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Ornithidium ochroleucum is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticultural settings."
