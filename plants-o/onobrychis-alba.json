    "intro": "Onobrychis alba, commonly known as white burr medic, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by hairy, burr-like pods. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Onobrychis alba is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and as a forage plant."
