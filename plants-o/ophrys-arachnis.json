    "intro": "Ophrys arachnis, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with a single, hairy, brownish-green pseudobulb and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, striking flower that resembles a spider, complete with a hairy, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The species is pollinated by male bees, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower's labellum."
