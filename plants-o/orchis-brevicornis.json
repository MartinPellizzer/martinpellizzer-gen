    "intro": "Orchis brevicornis, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and a distinctive, short, club-like spur at the base of the flower. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows. Orchis brevicornis is often found in association with other orchid species and is considered a rare and protected plant in many regions."
