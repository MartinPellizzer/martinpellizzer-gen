    "intro": "Ononis viscosa var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-seed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are short, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
