    "intro": "Oreocnide acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-pointed oreocnide, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and alternate, elliptic to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it is often found in forest understories. Oreocnide acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers."
