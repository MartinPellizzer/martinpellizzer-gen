    "intro": "Olyra dimidiata, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in many regions."
