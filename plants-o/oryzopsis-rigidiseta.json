    "intro": "Oryzopsis rigidiseta, commonly known as rigid awned grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces spikelets that are tightly packed, with bristle-like awns that give it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Oryzopsis rigidiseta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife in arid regions."
