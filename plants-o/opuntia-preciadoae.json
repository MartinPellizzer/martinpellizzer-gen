    "intro": "Opuntia preciadoae, commonly known as the Preciado's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Opuntia preciadoae is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental and culinary value."
