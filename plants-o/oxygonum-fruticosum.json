    "intro": "Oxygonum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetlands and moist soils in North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its heart-shaped leaves are typically a vibrant green, often with a reddish or purple hue on the underside. Oxygonum fruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
