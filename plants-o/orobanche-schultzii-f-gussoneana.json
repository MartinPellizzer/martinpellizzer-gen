    "intro": "Orobanche schultzii f. gussoneana, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, tubular flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in Mediterranean regions, attaching itself to hosts such as legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it penetrates the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
