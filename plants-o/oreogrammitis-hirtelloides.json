    "intro": "Oreogrammitis hirtelloides, commonly known as the hairy wall moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and hairy appearance due to the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaves. This plant typically grows on rock surfaces, especially in shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Oreogrammitis hirtelloides is well adapted to arid and rocky habitats, showcasing a remarkable ability to survive in harsh conditions."
