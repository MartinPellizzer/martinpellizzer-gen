    "intro": "Oberonia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves that are broad and ovate. The plant produces a single, racemose inflorescence with small, pale green to yellowish flowers. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to aid in nutrient absorption. Oberonia spathulata is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
