    "intro": "Ophrys delmeziana, commonly known as the Delmez orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions of Spain and Portugal. It is a terrestrial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower has a complex structure with a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. It blooms during late spring to early summer, typically between May and June. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
