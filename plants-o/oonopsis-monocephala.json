    "intro": "Oonopsis monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed oonopsis, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers and similar species. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branching. Oonopsis monocephala is primarily of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
