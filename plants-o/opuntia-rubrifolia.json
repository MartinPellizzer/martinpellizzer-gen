    "intro": "Opuntia rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are often tinged with a reddish hue, especially under sunlight. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its pads, or cladodes, are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage. Opuntia rubrifolia is well-suited to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
