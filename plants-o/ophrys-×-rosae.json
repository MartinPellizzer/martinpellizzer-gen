    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 rosae, commonly known as the rose orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (bee orchid) and Ophrys fucata (butterfly orchid). It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a distinctive rose-like pattern on the lip, which plays a crucial role in attracting pollinators. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. Its flowers are typically pale pink to reddish in color, with a complex structure that includes a prominent, hairy column. Ophrys \u00d7 rosae is a short-lived perennial, producing a single spike of flowers in late spring or early summer."
