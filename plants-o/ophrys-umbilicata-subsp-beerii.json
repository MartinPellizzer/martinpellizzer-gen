    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. beerii, commonly known as the beer orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky slopes. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure. The species is of particular interest to botanists due to its intricate pollination mechanism and limited distribution."
