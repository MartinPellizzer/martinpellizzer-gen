    "intro": "Ottelia japonica, commonly known as Japanese water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, with its roots submerged and leaves floating on the surface. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by rounded, green berries. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ottelia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
