These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Onochilis species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. The genus is part of the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae) and is known for its resilience and unique floral structures."
