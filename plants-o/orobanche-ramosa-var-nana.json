    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often branched and hairy. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with temperate climates. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its parasitic nature. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on parasitic plant biology and ecological interactions."
