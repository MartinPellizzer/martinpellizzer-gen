    "intro": "Oxytropis besseyi var. besseyi, commonly known as the Bessey's locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces compound leaves with stipules, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
