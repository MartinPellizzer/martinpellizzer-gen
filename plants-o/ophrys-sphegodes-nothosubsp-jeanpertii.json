    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes nothosubsp. jeanpertii, commonly known as the bee orchid variant, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowering period occurs during late spring to early summer, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
