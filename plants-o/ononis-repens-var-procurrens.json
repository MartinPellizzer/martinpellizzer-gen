    "intro": "Ononis repens var. procurrens, commonly known as creeping everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in open, sunny habitats."
