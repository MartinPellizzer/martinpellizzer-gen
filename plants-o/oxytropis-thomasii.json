    "intro": "Oxytropis thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis thomasii is often found in disturbed or open habitats and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
