It thrives in dry, sandy, or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and arid environments. The plant has small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from spring to summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soils in difficult landscapes."
