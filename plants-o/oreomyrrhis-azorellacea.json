    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis azorellacea, commonly known as the Azorean orchid, is a rare endemic species native to the Azores. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forested areas. The plant produces a single, slender stem with a single flower that is usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it has a short root system adapted to the rocky and nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction."
