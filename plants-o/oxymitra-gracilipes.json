    "intro": "Oxymitra gracilipes, commonly known as the slender oxymitra, is a flowering plant native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or near water bodies. Its small, intricate flowers are usually pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Oxymitra gracilipes is considered a conservation concern in many parts of its range."
