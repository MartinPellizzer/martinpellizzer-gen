    "intro": "Oberonia longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Oberonia longicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
