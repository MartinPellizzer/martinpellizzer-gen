    "intro": "Oreobolus obtusangulus subsp. unispicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandbur, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spiny seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland plains. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna."
