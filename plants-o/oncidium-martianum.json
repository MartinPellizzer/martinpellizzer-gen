    "intro": "Oncidium martianum, commonly known as the Martian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pendulous flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with intricate patterns. Oncidium martianum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
