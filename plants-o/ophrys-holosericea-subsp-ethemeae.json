    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. ethemeae, commonly known as the Ethea Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a prominent lip that is highly specialized for attracting male bees. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
