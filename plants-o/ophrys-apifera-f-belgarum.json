    "intro": "Ophrys apifera f. belgarum, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to parts of Europe and the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which closely resembles a bee, aiding in its pollination by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This orchid is a prime example of evolutionary adaptation through mimicry in the plant kingdom."
