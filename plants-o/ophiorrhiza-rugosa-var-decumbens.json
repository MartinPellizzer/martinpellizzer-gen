    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza rugosa var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate mangrove or slender mangrove, is a tropical shrub belonging to the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to stabilize coastal soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests along the coasts of Southeast Asia. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
