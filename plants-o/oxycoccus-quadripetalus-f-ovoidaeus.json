    "intro": "Oxycoccus quadripetalus f. ovoidaeus, commonly known as the oval-fruited bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and bright red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental berries make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The fruit is edible, though typically consumed by birds and small mammals rather than humans."
