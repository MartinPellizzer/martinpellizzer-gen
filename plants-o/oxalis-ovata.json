    "intro": "Oxalis ovata, commonly known as the kidneyleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Oxalis ovata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are edible, though it should be consumed in moderation due to its oxalic acid content."
