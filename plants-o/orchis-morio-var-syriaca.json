    "intro": "Orchis morio var. syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian early purple orchid, is a rare and protected species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it is pollinated primarily by bees. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
