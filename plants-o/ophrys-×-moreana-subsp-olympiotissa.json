    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 moreana subsp. olympiotissa, commonly known as the Olympic orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, thriving in the cool, moist environments of the Greek islands. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and white hues, with a distinct three-lobed lip that plays a key role in its unique pollination strategy. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and limited geographic distribution."
