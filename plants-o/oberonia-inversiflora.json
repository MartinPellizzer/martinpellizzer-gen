    "intro": "Oberonia inversiflora, commonly known as the inverted-flower orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, with petals and sepals arranged in a way that appears to be inverted compared to typical orchid morphology. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often emerging from the base of the leaves. Its foliage consists of elongated, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia inversiflora is considered a conservation concern."
