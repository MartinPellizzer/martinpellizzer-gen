    "intro": "Ophrys dicipulus, commonly known as the Greater Orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its complex, often showy flowers that mimic the appearance of female insects, a trait known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers have a distinctive structure with a lip that resembles an insect's body, aiding in pollination by bees and wasps. Ophrys dicipulus is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in local ecosystems."
