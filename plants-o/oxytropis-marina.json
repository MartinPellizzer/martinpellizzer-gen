It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features spiny, compound leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
