    "intro": "Ophioglossum sandieae, commonly known as the Sandie's adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the order Ophioglossales, which is one of the most primitive groups of ferns, characterized by its unique reproductive structures. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, elongated, and often divided leaf that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in small, stalked clusters on the underside of the leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum sandieae is considered a critically endangered species."
