    "intro": "Oxytropis densa, commonly known as the dense locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually compound, with small, rounded leaflets, and the stems are often branched and covered in fine hairs. Oxytropis densa is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
