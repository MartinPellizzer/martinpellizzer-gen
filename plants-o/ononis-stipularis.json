    "intro": "Ononis stipularis, commonly known as the common whitlowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers from late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems and are often surrounded by small, leaf-like bracts. Ononis stipularis is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
