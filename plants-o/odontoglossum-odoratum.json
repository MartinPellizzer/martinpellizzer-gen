    "intro": "Odontoglossum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that emit a sweet, spicy fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its humid, high-altitude habitat. Odontoglossum odoratum is prized by horticulturists for its ornamental value and unique aromatic qualities."
