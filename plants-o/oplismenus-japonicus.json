    "intro": "Oplismenus japonicus, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features dense clusters of small, green, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for succulents. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
