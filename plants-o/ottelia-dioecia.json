It is a semi-aquatic species that typically grows in shallow water or wet soil. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are pollinated by insects. Ottelia dioecia is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants."
