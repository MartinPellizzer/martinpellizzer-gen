It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. Its leaves are deeply dissected, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in scrublands and coastal areas.
