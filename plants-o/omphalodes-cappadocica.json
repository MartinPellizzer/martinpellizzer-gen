It features upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
