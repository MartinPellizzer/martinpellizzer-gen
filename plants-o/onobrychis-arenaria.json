    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria, commonly known as sand clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink or purple. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and is well adapted to arid and sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Sand clover is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
