    "intro": "Ouratea wallnoeferiana, commonly known as the red-leaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking red or orange during the dry season. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by ornamental red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of dense forests. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
