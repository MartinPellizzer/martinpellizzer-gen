    "intro": "Odollamia, commonly known as the American burr plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of two species, Odollamia verticillata and Odollamia tetrasepala, both native to the southeastern United States. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and distinctive, spiny fruit pods that resemble burrs. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pea-like structure typical of the legume family. Odollamia species are often found in moist, woodland habitats and are valued for their ornamental and ecological benefits."
