    "intro": "Orobanche crenata var. silvestris, commonly known as the wild broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root contact with host species such as legumes. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically white or pink in color, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants. Its distribution is primarily in Mediterranean regions, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
