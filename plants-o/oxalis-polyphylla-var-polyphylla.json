It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent groundcover. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
