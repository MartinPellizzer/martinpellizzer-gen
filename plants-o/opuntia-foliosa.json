    "intro": "Opuntia foliosa, commonly known as the leaf cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, jointed stems that are covered in small, spiny clusters called glochids. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fruit that contains inedible, angular seeds. Opuntia foliosa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent stems that store water. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xerophytic landscapes."
