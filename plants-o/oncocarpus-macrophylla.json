    "intro": "Oncocarpus macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it float on the water's surface while anchoring itself in the mud below. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Oncocarpus macrophylla plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native wetland ecosystems."
