    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 thellungiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in woodland and meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
