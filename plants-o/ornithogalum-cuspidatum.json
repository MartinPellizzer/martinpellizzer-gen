It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that resemble small bells. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Ornithogalum cuspidatum is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense clumps over time."
