    "intro": "Oxytropis introflexa, commonly known as the bent-stem locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate arrangements and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system."
