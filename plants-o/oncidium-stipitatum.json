    "intro": "Oncidium stipitatum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features pendant, racemose inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. Oncidium stipitatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the summer months, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
