    "intro": "Opuntia erinacea var. woodburyi, commonly known as the Woodbury's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
