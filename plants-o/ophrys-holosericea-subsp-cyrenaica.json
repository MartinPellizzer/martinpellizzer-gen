    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to North Africa. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
