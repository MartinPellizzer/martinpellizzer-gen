    "intro": "Olea peglerae, commonly known as the Cape York olive, is a small evergreen tree native to northern Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Oleaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, edible drupes that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. Olea peglerae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. It is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
