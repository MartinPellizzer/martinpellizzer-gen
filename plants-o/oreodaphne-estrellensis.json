    "intro": "Oreodaphne estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the humid montane forests of southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in fascicles, and it produces woody capsules as its fruit. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Oreodaphne estrellensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
