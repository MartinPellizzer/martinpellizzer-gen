    "intro": "Olea europaea var. pendulina, commonly known as the weeping olive, is a cultivar of the olive tree characterized by its distinctive drooping branches. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in warm, dry climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to olive fruits, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications. Its ornamental value comes from its cascading foliage and delicate appearance, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It requires minimal pruning and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
