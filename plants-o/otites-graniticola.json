    "intro": "Otites graniticola, commonly known as the granite otite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky, acidic soils in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Otites graniticola thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
