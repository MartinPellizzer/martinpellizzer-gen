    "intro": "Ornduffia umbricola var. beaugleholei, commonly known as the Cape York orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rainforest or wetland areas. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
