    "intro": "Onobrychis gaubae, commonly known as the Cape York burr. It is a leguminous shrub native to southern Africa, characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burrs that contain small, yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Onobrychis gaubae is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, improving soil fertility."
