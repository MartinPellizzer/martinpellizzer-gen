    "intro": "Oenotheridium sulfureum, commonly known as sulfurflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Onagraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which are often covered in a fine, sulfur-like dust, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Oenotheridium sulfureum is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds."
