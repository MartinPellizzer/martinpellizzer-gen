    "intro": "Orobanche minor var. hyalina, commonly known as the pale dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish stems and reduced leaves, with flowers that are usually pale green or white. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest in botanical studies."
