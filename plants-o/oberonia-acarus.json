    "intro": "Oberonia acarus, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, anchoring itself with its aerial roots while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are usually pale green or white, often with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture light in the dense forest canopy. Oberonia acarus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
