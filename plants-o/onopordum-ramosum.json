    "intro": "Onopordum ramosum, commonly known as the common thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, gray-green leaves and purple to pinkish flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are composed of both ray florets and disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Onopordum ramosum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in many regions."
