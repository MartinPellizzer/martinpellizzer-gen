    "intro": "Ostrya virginica var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese hop-hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often bronze or reddish in color during the autumn season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in urban and natural landscapes."
