    "intro": "Oreogrammitis wurunuran, commonly known as the Wurunuran wallrubble, is a rare fern native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically clustered close to the ground. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
