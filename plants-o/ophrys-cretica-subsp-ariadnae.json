    "intro": "Ophrys cretica subsp. ariadnae, commonly known as the Adriatic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
