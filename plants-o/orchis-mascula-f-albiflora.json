    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered male orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common soldier's orchid. It is characterized by its pale white or cream-colored flowers, which contrast sharply with the typical purple or brown hues of the species. This orchid is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in calcareous soils, typically in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature typical of many orchid species, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected plant in several countries."
