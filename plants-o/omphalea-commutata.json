    "intro": "Omphalea commutata, commonly known as the red spurge, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Gulf Coast. The plant is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Its sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, which is a common defensive mechanism in the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
