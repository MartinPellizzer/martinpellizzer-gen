    "intro": "Oplismenus longisetus, commonly known as the hairy dogtail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, cylindrical inflorescence that resembles a dog's tail. The plant has fine, hairy leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Oplismenus longisetus is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
