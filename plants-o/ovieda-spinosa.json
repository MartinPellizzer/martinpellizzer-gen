    "intro": "Ovieda spinosa, commonly known as the spiny ovieda, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Ovieda spinosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
