    "intro": "Orthothecium hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy orthothecium, is a species of moss belonging to the family Orthoteciaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy growth on the stems, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leafy shoots are often clustered and have a distinct, rugged appearance. Orthothecium hirsutum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
