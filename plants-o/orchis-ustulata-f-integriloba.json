    "intro": "Orchis ustulata f. integriloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often in bogs or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the inflorescence consists of several to many flowers arranged in a loose spike. This form is distinguished by its more robust and broader leaves compared to the typical form of the species."
