    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 cosentiana nothosubsp. nociana, commonly known as the Cosentian bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the southern Apennines of Italy. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for attracting male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. The nothosubspecies nociana is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from other forms of Ophrys \u00d7 cosentiana."
