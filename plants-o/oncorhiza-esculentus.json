    "intro": "Oncorhiza esculentus, commonly known as the edible root plant, is a perennial herbaceous species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fibrous, tuberous roots that are rich in starch and used in traditional cuisines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant's botanical significance lies in its potential as a sustainable food source and its role in local ecosystems."
