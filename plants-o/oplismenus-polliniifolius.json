    "intro": "Oplismenus polliniifolius, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Oplismenus polliniifolius is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodland floors and along stream banks."
