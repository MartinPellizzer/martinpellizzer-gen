    "intro": "Orchis tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with three prominent teeth on the lip. Orchis tridentata thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It plays an important role in pollination, attracting various insects such as bees and butterflies."
