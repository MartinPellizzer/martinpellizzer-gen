    "intro": "Olmedia calophylla, commonly known as the Mexican olive, is a small evergreen tree native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
