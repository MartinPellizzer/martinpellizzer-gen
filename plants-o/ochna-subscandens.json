    "intro": "Ochna subscandens, commonly known as the climbing ochna, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright orange or red berries that are attractive to birds. Its bark is smooth and sometimes flaky, and it has a woody stem that can climb or trail along the ground. Ochna subscandens is valued for its ornamental berries and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
