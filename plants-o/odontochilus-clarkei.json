    "intro": "Odontochilus clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and possesses distinctive tooth-like projections on its leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high light intensity but requires careful management of moisture levels. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
