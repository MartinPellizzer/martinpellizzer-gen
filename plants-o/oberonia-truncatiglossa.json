    "intro": "Oberonia truncatiglossa, commonly known as the truncated tongue orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted leaves, which are typically dark green and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, and it blooms during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
