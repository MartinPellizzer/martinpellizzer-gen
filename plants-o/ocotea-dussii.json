    "intro": "Ocotea dussii, commonly known as the Brazilian camphor tree, is a member of the Lauraceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its aromatic, glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue-black berries containing one or two seeds. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties. The species is also valued for its timber, which is durable and has a distinctive scent."
