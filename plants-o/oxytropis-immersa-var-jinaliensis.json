    "intro": "Oxytropis immersa var. jinaliensis, commonly known as the Jinali locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and water-scarce environments. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, which helps reduce water loss through transpiration. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
