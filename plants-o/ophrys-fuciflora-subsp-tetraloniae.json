    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. tetraloniae, commonly known as the four-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny environments such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are small, greenish-brown, and possess intricate patterns that enhance their mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
