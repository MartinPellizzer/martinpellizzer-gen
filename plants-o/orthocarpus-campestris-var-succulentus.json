    "intro": "Orthocarpus campestris var. succulentus, commonly known as the succulent dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and yellow composite flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant's succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
