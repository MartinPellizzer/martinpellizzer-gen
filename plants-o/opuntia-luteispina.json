    "intro": "Opuntia luteispina, commonly known as the yellow-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines, which are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia luteispina is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems to survive drought conditions. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
