    "intro": "Orianthera serpyllifolia, commonly known as silverleaf dandelion, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. Orianthera serpyllifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant garden plant."
