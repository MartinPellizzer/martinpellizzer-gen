    "intro": "Orchis canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in areas with limited soil cover. Its morphology includes a tall, erect stem with a single, showy inflorescence. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
