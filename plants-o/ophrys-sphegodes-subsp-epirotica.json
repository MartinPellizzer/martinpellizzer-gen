    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. epirotica, commonly known as the Epirotic bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands or woodland edges. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow coloration. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
