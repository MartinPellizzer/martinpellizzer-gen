    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. recurva, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with a distinctive dark purple spot on the lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stem is usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant is pollinated primarily by bees and other insect pollinators."
