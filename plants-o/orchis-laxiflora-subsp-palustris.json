    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe. It produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and bears showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs and marshes. Its morphology is adapted to its wetland environment, with specialized root systems for water absorption. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated flowers and broader leaves compared to other orchis species."
