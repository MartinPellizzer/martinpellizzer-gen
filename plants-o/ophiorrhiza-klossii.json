It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually clustered at the base of the stems. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by tiny, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. Ophiorrhiza klossii is often found growing on the branches of trees, relying on its host for some of its nutrients."
