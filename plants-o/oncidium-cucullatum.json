    "intro": "Oncidium cucullatum, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically arranged in a raceme. Oncidium cucullatum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and vibrant colors make it a popular choice for both indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
