    "intro": "Oenothera fruticosa var. subglobosa, commonly known as the globular evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to xeriscaping."
