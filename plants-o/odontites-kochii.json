    "intro": "Odontites kochii, commonly known as the Alpine toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Odontites kochii is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
