    "intro": "Otites donetzicus subsp. sillingeri, commonly known as the Donetsky otites, is a rare grass species native to eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
