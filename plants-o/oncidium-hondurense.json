    "intro": "Oncidium hondurense, commonly known as the Honduras orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a fan shape, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. Oncidium hondurense is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to flourish."
