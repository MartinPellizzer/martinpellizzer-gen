    "intro": "Olearia aglossa, commonly known as the silver olearia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. Olearia aglossa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
