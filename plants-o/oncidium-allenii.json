    "intro": "Oncidium allenii, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, long-lasting yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium allenii is popular among orchid growers for its ease of care and vibrant, showy blooms."
