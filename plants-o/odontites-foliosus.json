    "intro": "Odontites foliosus, commonly known as the fern moss or the toothed fern moss, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, tooth-like leaves that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a dense mat of leafy stems and rhizomes, which help it anchor to substrates. Odontites foliosus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
