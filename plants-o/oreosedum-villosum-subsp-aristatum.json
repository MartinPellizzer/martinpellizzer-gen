    "intro": "Oreosedum villosum subsp. aristatum, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of North America. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its succulent leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
