    "intro": "Ophrys bicornis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark, bee-like face and two prominent \"horns\" at the base. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, typically arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Ophrys bicornis thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
