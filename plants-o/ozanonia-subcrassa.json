    "intro": "Ozanonia subcrassa, commonly known as the broad-leaved ozanonia, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ozanonia subcrassa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
