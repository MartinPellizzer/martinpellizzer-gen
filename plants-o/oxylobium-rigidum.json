It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Oxylobium rigidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
