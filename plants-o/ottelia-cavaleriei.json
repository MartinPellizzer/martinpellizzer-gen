    "intro": "Ottelia cavaleriei, commonly known as the African water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are usually floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Ottelia cavaleriei is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
