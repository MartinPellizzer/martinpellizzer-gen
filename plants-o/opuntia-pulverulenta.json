    "intro": "Opuntia pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, segmented stems that are covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red to purple fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf surfaces and extensive root systems for water absorption. Opuntia pulverulenta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
