    "intro": "Ophrys transhyrcana var. turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkestan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
