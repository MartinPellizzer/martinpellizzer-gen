    "intro": "Oreogrammitis universa, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Oreogrammitis universa plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
