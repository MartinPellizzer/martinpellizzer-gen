    "intro": "Ostryoderris gabonica, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a rare and hardy tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark bark and small, oval-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its durable wood, which is resistant to decay and insects. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
