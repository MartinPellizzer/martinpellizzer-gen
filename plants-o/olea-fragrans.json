    "intro": "Olea fragrans, commonly known as the sweet olive, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, emitting a sweet, spicy scent. These flowers are typically followed by small, leathery fruits that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. Olea fragrans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
