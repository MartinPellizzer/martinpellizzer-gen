    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza flava, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood or yellow mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found growing in brackish or saline environments. Ophiorrhiza flava is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Its ability to thrive in coastal areas makes it a key species in the study of plant adaptation to saline conditions."
