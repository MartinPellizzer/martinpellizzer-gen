    "intro": "Onosma tournefortii, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Onosma tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
