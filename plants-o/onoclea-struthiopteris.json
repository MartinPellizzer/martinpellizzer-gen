    "intro": "Onoclea struthiopteris, commonly known as the common brittle bladderwort, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups known as indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique ability to absorb nutrients through its leaves makes it an interesting subject in botanical studies."
