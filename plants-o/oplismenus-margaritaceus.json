    "intro": "Oplismenus margaritaceus, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of broad, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of small, white or pale blue flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
