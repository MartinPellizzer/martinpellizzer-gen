    "intro": "Ortachne pilosa, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Ortachne pilosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
