    "intro": "Osmunda banksiifolia, commonly known as the eastern royal fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, rhizomatous growth habit with a short, thick, underground stem. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Osmundaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands."
