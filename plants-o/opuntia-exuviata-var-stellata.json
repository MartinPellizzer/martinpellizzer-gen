    "intro": "Opuntia exuviata var. stellata, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems that are often adorned with clusters of small, star-shaped spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia exuviata var. stellata is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
