    "intro": "Oxalis rosacea, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content. Oxalis rosacea thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shady garden beds. Its delicate appearance and ability to spread via runners make it both ornamental and sometimes invasive."
