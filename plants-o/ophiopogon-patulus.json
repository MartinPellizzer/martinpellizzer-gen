    "intro": "Ophiopogon patulus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial evergreen plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its ornate appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground covers in suitable conditions."
