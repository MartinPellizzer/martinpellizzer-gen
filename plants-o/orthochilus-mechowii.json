    "intro": "Orthochilus mechowii, commonly known as the Mechoew's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
