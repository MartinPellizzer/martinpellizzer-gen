    "intro": "Orobanche daninii, commonly known as the Danin's broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host seeds. It is native to regions of southern Europe and the Mediterranean, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
