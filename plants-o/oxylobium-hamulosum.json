    "intro": "Oxylobium hamulosum, commonly known as the mountain lily or fringed mountain lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Oxylobium hamulosum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
