    "intro": "Oenothera latifolia, commonly known as evening primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Oenothera latifolia is also noted for its medicinal uses, particularly for its oil-rich seeds."
