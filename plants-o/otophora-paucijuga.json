    "intro": "Otophora paucijuga, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Its floral structure is typical of the orchid family, with three sepals and three petals, though the latter are often reduced. Otophora paucijuga is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in association with other alpine flora."
