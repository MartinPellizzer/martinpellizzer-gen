    "intro": "Oreophila sessiliflora, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and adapted to cold, dry conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
