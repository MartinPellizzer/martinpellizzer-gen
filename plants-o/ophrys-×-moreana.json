It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with brown markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits.
