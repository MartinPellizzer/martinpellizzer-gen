It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The flowers bloom in clusters, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
