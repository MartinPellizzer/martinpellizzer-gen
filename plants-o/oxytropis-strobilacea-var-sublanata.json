    "intro": "Oxytropis strobilacea var. sublanata, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to cream in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soils and support native wildlife."
