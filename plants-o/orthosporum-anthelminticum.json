It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its potential anti-parasitic effects."
