These plants are characterized by their delicate, fragrant flowers that often emit a sweet, floral aroma. Osculisa species typically have elongated, strap-like leaves and are native to tropical and subtropical regions. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated for its unique and aromatic blooms."
