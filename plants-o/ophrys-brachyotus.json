    "intro": "Ophrys brachyotus, commonly known as the short-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which features a prominent labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with a distinctive, short lip. Ophrys brachyotus is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
