    "intro": "Oenothera paralamarckiana, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and reduced water loss mechanisms. Oenothera paralamarckiana is also noted for its ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations and stabilizing sandy soils."
