    "intro": "Olmedia mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf olmedia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its deep green stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, Olmedia mollis is a popular choice in xeriscaping."
