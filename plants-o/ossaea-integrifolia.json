    "intro": "Ossaea integrifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and form a single, short stem, followed by a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds by wind. Ossaea integrifolia is characterized by its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
