    "intro": "Ononis pendula var. munbyi, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
