    "intro": "Osyris rotundata, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of broad, oval leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are often submerged, with the uppermost leaves emerging above the water surface. Osyris rotundata is valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to help stabilize aquatic ecosystems."
