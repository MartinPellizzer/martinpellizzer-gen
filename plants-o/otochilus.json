    "intro": "Otochilus, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers and are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus includes several species, many of which are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Otochilus species usually have pseudobulbs and are known for their delicate, fragrant blooms. Their botanical significance lies in their role in orchid diversity and their adaptation to various ecological niches."
