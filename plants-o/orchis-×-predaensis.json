It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Balkans. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, where it thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers are usually pale purple to pink, with a distinctive hooded lip that is characteristic of many orchid species.
