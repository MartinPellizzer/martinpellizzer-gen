    "intro": "Otidia ceratophylla, commonly known as the horned fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its unique, clustered fronds that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. Otidia ceratophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
