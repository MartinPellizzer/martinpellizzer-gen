It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often feature intricate patterns in shades of red, yellow, and green. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in low-light conditions.
