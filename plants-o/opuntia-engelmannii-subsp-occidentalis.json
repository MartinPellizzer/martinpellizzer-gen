    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, pad-like stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and plays a role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems."
