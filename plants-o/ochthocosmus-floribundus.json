    "intro": "Ochthocosmus floribundus, commonly known as the showy goldenbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has silvery-green foliage with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Ochthocosmus floribundus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
