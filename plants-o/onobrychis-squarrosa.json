It is characterized by its hairy, square stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular heads, followed by distinctive, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Onobrychis squarrosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
