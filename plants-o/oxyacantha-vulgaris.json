    "intro": "Oxyacantha vulgaris, commonly known as the common dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright red berries in the fall. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and a smooth, greyish bark. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Oxyacantha vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
