    "intro": "Oaxacania, commonly known as the \"Mexican dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Oaxacania species are often found in dry, rocky soils and are adapted to arid environments. They produce small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, similar to those of dandelions."
