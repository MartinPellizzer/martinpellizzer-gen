    "intro": "Odontoloma bifidum, commonly known as the bifid spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its closely spaced, spirally arranged leaves that form a dense, cushion-like growth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are thin and often have a distinctive, bifid (two-lobed) appearance at the base. Odontoloma bifidum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
