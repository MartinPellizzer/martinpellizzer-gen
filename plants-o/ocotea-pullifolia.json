    "intro": "Ocotea pullifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery taste. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Its aromatic foliage and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
