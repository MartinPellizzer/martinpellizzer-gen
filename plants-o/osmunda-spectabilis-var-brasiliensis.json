    "intro": "Osmunda spectabilis var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian royal fern, is a fern native to South America. It is characterized by its large, ornate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, fleshy rootstock that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant."
