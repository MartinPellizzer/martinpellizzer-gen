    "intro": "Ormosia trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Ormosia trifoliolata is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
