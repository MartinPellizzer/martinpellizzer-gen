    "intro": "Odontites eliassennenii, commonly known as the Eliasson's toothed fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, tooth-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
