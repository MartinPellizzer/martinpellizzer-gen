    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia f. pallens, commonly known as the pale vetch, is a variant of the common vetch, characterized by its lighter green foliage. It is a leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family, known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its pale coloration distinguishes it from the typical form of the species."
