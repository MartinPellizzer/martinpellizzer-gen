    "intro": "Onosma sibirica, commonly known as Siberian everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, adapted to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Onosma sibirica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
