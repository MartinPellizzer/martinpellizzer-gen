    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. pseudoscolopax, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this variant is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
