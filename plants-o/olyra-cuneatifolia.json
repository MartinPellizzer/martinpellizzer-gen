    "intro": "Olyra cuneatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf olyra, is a member of the Arecaceae family, native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a small to medium-sized palm characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of narrow, linear leaves. The leaves are typically arranged in a fan shape, with each leaf blade being thin and elongated, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, three-angled fruits. Olyra cuneatifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils in full sun."
