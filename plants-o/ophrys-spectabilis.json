    "intro": "Ophrys spectabilis, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are primarily pollinated through a process called sexual deception, where males are tricked into attempting to mate with the flower. Ophrys spectabilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
