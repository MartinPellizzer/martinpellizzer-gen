It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is known for its short stature and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or small shrubs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
