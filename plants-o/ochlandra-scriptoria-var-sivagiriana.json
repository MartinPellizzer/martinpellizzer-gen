It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
