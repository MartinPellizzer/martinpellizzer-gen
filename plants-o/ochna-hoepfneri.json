    "intro": "Ochna hoepfneri, commonly known as the African velvet tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, fragrant yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, orange aril. Ochna hoepfneri thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
