    "intro": "Oreobolus clandestinus, commonly known as the hidden sand sedge, is a small, perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or salt lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its flowers are usually brown or pale green, and the plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Oreobolus clandestinus is often found in coastal or inland saline areas, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils."
