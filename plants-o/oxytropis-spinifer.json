    "intro": "Oxytropis spinifer, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Oxytropis spinifer is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
