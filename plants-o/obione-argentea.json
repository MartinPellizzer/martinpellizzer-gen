    "intro": "Obione argentea, commonly known as silverleaf obione, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray leaves covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice among gardeners in arid climates."
