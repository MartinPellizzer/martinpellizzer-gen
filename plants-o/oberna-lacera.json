    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna lacera, commonly known as the delicate fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in spiky inflorescences, and are usually green or yellow in color. Oberna lacera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings."
