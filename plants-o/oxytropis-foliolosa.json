    "intro": "Oxytropis foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems and palmately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Oxytropis foliolosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
