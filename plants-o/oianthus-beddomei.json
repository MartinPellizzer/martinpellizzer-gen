    "intro": "Oianthus beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's lily, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of Socotra. Its foliage consists of broad, fleshy leaves that help store water, a feature common in xerophytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Oianthus beddomei is considered vulnerable and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
