    "intro": "Osmia alternans, commonly known as the variable mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is a medium-sized bee, typically measuring between 10 to 15 millimeters in length, with a distinctive metallic blue or green sheen on its body. The female constructs its nest in pre-existing cavities, such as hollow stems or artificial tubes, where it lays a single egg per cell. The plant-related aspects of Osmia alternans primarily involve its role as a pollinator, contributing to the reproduction of a wide range of flowering plants. Its foraging behavior is closely tied to the blooming cycles of plants, making it an important species in maintaining plant biodiversity."
