    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza australiana subsp. australiana, commonly known as the Australian sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or heathlands. Due to its fragrant oils and ecological importance, it is valued both for its botanical interest and its role in local ecosystems."
