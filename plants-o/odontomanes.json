    "intro": "Odontomanes, commonly known as the \"toothed grass\" or \"spear grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and distinctive, spiky inflorescences that resemble a crown of teeth. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its deep root system. Odontomanes species are often found in sandy soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Due to its unique morphology and ecological resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
