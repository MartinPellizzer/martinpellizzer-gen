    "intro": "Oncidium olivaceum var. lawrenceanum, commonly known as the Lawrenceanum orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, racemose inflorescence that produces numerous fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and help store water, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
