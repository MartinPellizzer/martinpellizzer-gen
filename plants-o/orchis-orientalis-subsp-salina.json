    "intro": "Orchis orientalis subsp. salina, commonly known as the salt marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in brackish or saline soils, often found in wetlands, dunes, and coastal areas. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and habitat specificity."
