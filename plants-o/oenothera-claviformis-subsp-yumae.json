    "intro": "Oenothera claviformis subsp. yumae, commonly known as the Yuma evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and linear, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its adaptation to desert conditions."
