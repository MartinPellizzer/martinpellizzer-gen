    "intro": "Osteophloeum, commonly known as the \"boneleaf\" or \"stoneleaf,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, often opposite leaves that may have a leathery texture. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with four to five petals, and the fruits are usually dry, capsule-like structures. Osteophloeum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia. These plants are often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands."
