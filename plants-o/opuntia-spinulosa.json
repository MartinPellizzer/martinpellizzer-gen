    "intro": "Opuntia spinulosa, commonly known as the slender prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems, which are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia spinulosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
