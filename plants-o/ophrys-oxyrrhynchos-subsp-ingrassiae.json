    "intro": "Ophrys oxyrrhynchos subsp. ingrassiae, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in temperate to subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
