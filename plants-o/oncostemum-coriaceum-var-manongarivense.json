    "intro": "Oncostemum coriaceum var. manongarivense, commonly known as the Manongariv\u00e9 cactus, is a unique succulent native to the Andes of Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged structure. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a prized specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
