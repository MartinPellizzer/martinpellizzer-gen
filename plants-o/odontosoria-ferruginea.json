    "intro": "Odontosoria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a rusty-brown to reddish-brown coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, across tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are pinnate, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are often curled or rolled when young. Odontosoria ferruginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often used in shaded garden settings."
