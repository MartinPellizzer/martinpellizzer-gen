    "intro": "Oncidium veltenianum, commonly known as the Velten's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically blooms in clusters, with each flower having three sepals and three petals, one of which is often modified into a lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium veltenianum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
