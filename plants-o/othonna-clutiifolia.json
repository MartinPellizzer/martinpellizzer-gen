    "intro": "Othonna clutiifolia, commonly known as the silver bush or African snowbush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Othonna clutiifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
