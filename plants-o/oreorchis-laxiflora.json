    "intro": "Oreorchis laxiflora, commonly known as the loose-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces slender, erect stems bearing several showy, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive, spurred petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Oreorchis laxiflora is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in small colonies during its blooming season."
