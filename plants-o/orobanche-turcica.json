    "intro": "Orobanche turcica, commonly known as the Turkish broom weed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is native to regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia, often growing in disturbed or arid soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops by reducing their growth and yield."
