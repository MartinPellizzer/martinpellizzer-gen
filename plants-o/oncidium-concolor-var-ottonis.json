    "intro": "Oncidium concolor var. ottonis, commonly known as the Lemon-scented Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its leaves are sword-shaped,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right growing conditions."
