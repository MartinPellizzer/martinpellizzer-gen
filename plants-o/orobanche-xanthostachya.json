    "intro": "Orobanche xanthostachya, commonly known as the yellow stemless broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, where it parasitizes various species of legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
