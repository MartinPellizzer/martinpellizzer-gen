    "intro": "Oxalis corrientesensis, commonly known as the Corrientes wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. It produces edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed with caution due to oxalic acid content. Oxalis corrientesensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
