    "intro": "Opuntia leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and clusters of small, rounded pads. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia leptocarpa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for desert ecosystems."
