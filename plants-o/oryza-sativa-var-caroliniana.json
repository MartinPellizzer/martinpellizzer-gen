    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina ricegrass, is a wild rice species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of slow-moving water bodies. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective husk, a characteristic feature of the Oryza genus. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its ecological significance and potential for genetic diversity."
