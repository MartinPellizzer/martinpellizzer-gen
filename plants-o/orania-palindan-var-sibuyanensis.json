    "intro": "Orania palindan var. sibuyanensis, commonly known as the Sibuyan orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Sibuyan in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients in its native humid forest environment. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
