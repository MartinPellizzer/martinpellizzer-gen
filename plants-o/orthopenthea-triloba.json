    "intro": "Orthopenthea triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
