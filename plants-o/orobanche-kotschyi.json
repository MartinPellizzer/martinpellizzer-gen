    "intro": "Orobanche kotschyi, commonly known as the desert broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for its nutrients. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its root system consists of haustoria, specialized structures that attach to the roots of host plants. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
