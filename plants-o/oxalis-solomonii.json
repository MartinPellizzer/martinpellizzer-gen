It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow and white, often arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Oxalis solomonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
