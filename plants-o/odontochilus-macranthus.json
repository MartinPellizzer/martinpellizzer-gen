    "intro": "Odontochilus macranthus, commonly known as the large-flowered toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and its striking, showy flowers that feature a distinctive toothed lip. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
