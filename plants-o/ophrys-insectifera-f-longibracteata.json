    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera f. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, growing from a rhizomatous root system. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heaths."
