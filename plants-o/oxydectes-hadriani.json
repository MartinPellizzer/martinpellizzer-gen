It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Oxydectes hadriani is often found growing along coastal areas and in sandy soils, adapting well to saline environments. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
