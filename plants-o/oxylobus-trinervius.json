    "intro": "Oxylobus trinervius, commonly known as the three-veined saxifrage, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves with three prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
