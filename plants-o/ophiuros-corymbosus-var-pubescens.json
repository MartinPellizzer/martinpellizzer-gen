    "intro": "Ophiuros corymbosus var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false holly, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" characteristic. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
