It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
