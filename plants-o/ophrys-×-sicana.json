It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, exhibiting a unique combination of traits from both parent species. The plant is characterized by its striking, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its roots are typically mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Ophrys \u00d7 sicana is often found in open, sunny habitats across southern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
