    "intro": "Oreosedum album subsp. micranthum, commonly known as silverleaf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for low-maintenance landscaping."
