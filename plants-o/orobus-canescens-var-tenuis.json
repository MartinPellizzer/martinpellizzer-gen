    "intro": "Orobus canescens var. tenuis, commonly known as slender desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil and low moisture conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
