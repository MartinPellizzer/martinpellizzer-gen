It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow flowers in spikes. The plant has a deep root system, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
