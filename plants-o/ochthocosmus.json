    "intro": "Ochthocosmus, commonly known as the goldenstar milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Ochthocosmus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies."
