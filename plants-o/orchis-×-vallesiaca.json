    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesi orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis mascula and Orchis morio. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are spurred at the base and have a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many Orchidaceae species. The Vallesi orchid is often found in the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Europe."
