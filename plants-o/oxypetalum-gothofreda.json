    "intro": "Oxypetalum gothofreda, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
