    "intro": "Orobus atropatanus, commonly known as the black-horned orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant produces intricate flowers with dark purple petals and sepals, often adorned with intricate veining. Its growth is slow, and it typically blooms once every few years, making it a rare sight in the wild. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
