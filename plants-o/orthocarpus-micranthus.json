    "intro": "Orthocarpus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered orthocarpus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Orthocarpus micranthus is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in New Zealand's native flora."
