    "intro": "Ophiopogon heterandrus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Ophiopogon heterandrus is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
