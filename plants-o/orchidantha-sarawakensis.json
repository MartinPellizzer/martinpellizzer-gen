    "intro": "Orchidantha sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak orchid, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss, Orchidantha sarawakensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
