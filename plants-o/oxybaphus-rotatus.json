    "intro": "Oxybaphus rotatus, commonly known as the spiny cactus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warm season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are reduced to spines, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Oxybaphus rotatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
