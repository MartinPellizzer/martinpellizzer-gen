It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and produces cylindrical, inflated seed pods that resemble bladders, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Oxytropis ampullacea is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
