    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus biseta, commonly known as the two-lobed moss fern, is a rare and delicate member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and intricate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in minute hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are usually found on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
