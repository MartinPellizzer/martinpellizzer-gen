    "intro": "Oceaniopteris gibba, commonly known as the giant kelp or giant featherwing, is a large brown alga that thrives in marine environments. It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a complex structure with a holdfast, stipe, and fronds, typical of kelp species. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Oceaniopteris gibba plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
