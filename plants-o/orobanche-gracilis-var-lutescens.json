    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis var. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is characterized by a short growing season, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
