    "intro": "Ottelia kunenensis, commonly known as the African water starwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in shallow water or wetland environments, often with its roots submerged and leaves floating on the surface. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are usually broad and oval, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Ottelia kunenensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
