    "intro": "Orchis morio var. provincialis, commonly known as the provincial marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in damp, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and wet meadows. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing a cluster of showy, violet-blue flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more subdued flower color compared to the typical form of Orchis morio."
