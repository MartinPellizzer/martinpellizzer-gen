    "intro": "Ottonia subglauca, commonly known as the bluebell of the rock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery blue-gray bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Ottonia subglauca is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it forms dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
