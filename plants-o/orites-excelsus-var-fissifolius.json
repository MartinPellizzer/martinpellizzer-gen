It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
