    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza montisschraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Ophiorrhiza montisschraderi is found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments."
