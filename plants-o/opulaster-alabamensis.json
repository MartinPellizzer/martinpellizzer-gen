    "intro": "Opulaster alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama opulaster, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is found in specific habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Opulaster alabamensis is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
