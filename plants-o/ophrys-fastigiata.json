    "intro": "Ophrys fastigiata, commonly known as the upright bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys fastigiata is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
