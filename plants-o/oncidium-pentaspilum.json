    "intro": "Oncidium pentaspilum, commonly known as the Orchid of the Month, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees without requiring soil. Oncidium pentaspilum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
