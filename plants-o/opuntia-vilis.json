    "intro": "Opuntia vilis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia vilis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in both ecological systems and human cultures, particularly in traditional medicine and cuisine."
