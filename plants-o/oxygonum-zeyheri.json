    "intro": "Oxygonum zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of opposite, narrow, grass-like leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its flowering stems rise above the water, producing small, clustered yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Oxygonum zeyheri is valued in ornamental water gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
