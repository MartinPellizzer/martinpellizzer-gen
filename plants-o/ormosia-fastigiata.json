The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by flat, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. The species is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
