    "intro": "Omalotheca caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features a rosette of blue to purple, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in rocky or dry soils. Omalotheca caucasica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
