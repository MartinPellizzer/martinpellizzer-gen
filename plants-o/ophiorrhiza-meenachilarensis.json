    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza meenachilarensis, commonly known as the Meenachil River sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
