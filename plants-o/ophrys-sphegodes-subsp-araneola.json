    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. araneola, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The subspecies araneola is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more delicate floral morphology compared to other subspecies of Ophrys sphegodes."
