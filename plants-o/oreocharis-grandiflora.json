    "intro": "Oreocharis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered oreocharis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive greenish throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
