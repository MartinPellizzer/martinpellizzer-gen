    "intro": "Orbea picta, commonly known as the painted orbea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Orbea picta is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with stems that can be branched or unbranched. Its flowers bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects."
