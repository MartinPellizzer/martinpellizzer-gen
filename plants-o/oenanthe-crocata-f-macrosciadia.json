It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often deeply lobed. The flowers are bright orange-red, with five petals, and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
