It is characterized by its slender, often climbing stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns, which help in attracting specific pollinators. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
