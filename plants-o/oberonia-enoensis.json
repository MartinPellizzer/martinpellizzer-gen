    "intro": "Oberonia enoensis, commonly known as the Enoe's orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia enoensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
