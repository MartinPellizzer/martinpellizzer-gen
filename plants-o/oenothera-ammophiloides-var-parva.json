    "intro": "Oenothera ammophiloides var. parva, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and provides nectar for nocturnal pollinators."
