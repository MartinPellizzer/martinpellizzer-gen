    "intro": "Oreopanax nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan oreopanax, is a climbing plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a follicle containing several seeds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
