    "intro": "Onosma \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid heliotrope, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Boraginaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, violet or purple flowers that resemble those of the common heliotrope. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. The hybrid nature of Onosma \u00d7 hybrida results from crosses between different species within the Onosma genus, leading to a variety of cultivars with distinct floral characteristics."
