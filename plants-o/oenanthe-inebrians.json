    "intro": "Oenanthe inebrians, commonly known as the deadly carrot or poison hemlock, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to greenish flowers. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, particularly coniine, which can be lethal to humans and animals. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. Due to its similarity to edible plants like parsley and carrots, it poses a significant risk of accidental poisoning."
