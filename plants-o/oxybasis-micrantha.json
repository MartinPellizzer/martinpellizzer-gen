    "intro": "Oxybasis micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered oxybasis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are often surrounded by narrow, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. Oxybasis micrantha is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
