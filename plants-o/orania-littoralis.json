    "intro": "Orania littoralis, commonly known as the coastal orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the sandy shores of southern Africa. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often growing in dune environments where it is exposed to strong winds and tidal influences. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the late spring and early summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes, playing a vital role in preventing erosion. Orania littoralis is an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems and is often found in association with other halophytic plants."
