It features a tall, erect stem with a single, showy purple or violet flower that has a distinctive spurred lip. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. It produces a single, fragrant flower that blooms in late spring to early summer. This orchid is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and marshy habitats."
