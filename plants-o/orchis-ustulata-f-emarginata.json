    "intro": "Orchis ustulata f. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. Its morphology is adapted to grow in shaded, moist habitats, often in woodland areas. This botanical variant is distinguished by its emarginate (notched) lip, which is a key identifying feature."
