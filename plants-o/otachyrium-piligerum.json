    "intro": "Otachyrium piligerum, commonly known as the hairy otachyrium, is a species of flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often adorned with soft, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Otachyrium piligerum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
