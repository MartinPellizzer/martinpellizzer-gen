    "intro": "Ophrys arnoldii, commonly known as the Arnold's bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Its flowers are usually pale brown or yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys arnoldii is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
