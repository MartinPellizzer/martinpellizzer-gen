    "intro": "Ornithogalum sylvaticum, commonly known as the woodland cowpea, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a plant to be handled with care."
