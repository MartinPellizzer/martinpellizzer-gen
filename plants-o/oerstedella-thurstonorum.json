    "intro": "Oerstedella thurstonorum, commonly known as the Thurston's oerstedella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its growth is closely tied to specific soil conditions, often requiring a rich, loamy substrate with good drainage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
