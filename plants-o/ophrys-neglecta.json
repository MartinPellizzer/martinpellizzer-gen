    "intro": "Ophrys neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys neglecta is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, blooming in late spring to early summer."
