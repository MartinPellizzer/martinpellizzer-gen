It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem with rough, gray bark and elliptic to ovate leaves with a glossy texture. Oxylobium obtusifolium is often found in moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats."
