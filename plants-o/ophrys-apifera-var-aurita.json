    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. aurita, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized labellum that resembles a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. It thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The orchid is a hemiparasitic plant, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, and is often found in calcareous soils."
