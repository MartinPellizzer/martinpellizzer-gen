    "intro": "Orobus vernus, commonly known as the spring gentian, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Orobus vernus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the early growing season."
