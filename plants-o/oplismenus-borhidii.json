    "intro": "Oplismenus borhidii, commonly known as the golden star grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green with a slight blue tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters during the late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist, shaded environments. Oplismenus borhidii is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in other damp, wooded areas."
