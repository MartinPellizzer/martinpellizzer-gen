    "intro": "Osyris arborea var. tipitata, commonly known as the white osier dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that peels in thin, papery strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy green surface."
