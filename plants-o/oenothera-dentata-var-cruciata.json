It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that open in the evening, and its lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive cross-shaped base. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Oenothera dentata var. cruciata is an important species in ecological studies due to its role in pollination and its adaptability to arid environments."
