    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. subratoonica, commonly known as the subratoonica rice variety, is a less commonly cultivated rice subspecies originating from Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shorter stature and compact growth habit compared to other rice varieties. This variety is typically grown in lowland areas with high water tables, requiring consistent irrigation. Its grains are generally smaller and have a higher amylose content, contributing to a firmer texture when cooked. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is often used in niche agricultural settings or for traditional culinary purposes."
