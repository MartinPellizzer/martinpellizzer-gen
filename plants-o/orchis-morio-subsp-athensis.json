    "intro": "Orchis morio subsp. athensis, commonly known as the Greek early orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several lance-shaped leaves and a spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are characterized by a spurred lip and a distinct column, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It blooms in early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering orchids in its habitat."
