    "intro": "Oncidium wallisii, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers that resemble butterflies, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium wallisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting, showy blooms."
