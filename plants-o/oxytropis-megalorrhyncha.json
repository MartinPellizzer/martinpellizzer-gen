    "intro": "Oxytropis megalorrhyncha, commonly known as the giant horned vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, erect stems and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Oxytropis megalorrhyncha is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in nutrient-poor environments."
