    "intro": "Olearia stuartii, commonly known as the Stewart's tree-fern, is a unique plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in fibrous, leaf-like scales. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Olearia stuartii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
