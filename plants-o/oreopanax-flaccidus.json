    "intro": "Oreopanax flaccidus, commonly known as the flaccid sycoglossum, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by dark red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
