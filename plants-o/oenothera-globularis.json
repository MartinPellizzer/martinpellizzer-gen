    "intro": "Oenothera globularis, commonly known as the globular evening primrose, is a species of flowering plant in the Onagraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its spherical, yellow-orange flower heads that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
