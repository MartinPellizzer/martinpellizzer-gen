    "intro": "Orchis aetnensis var. laxiflora, commonly known as the Aetna orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the volcanic regions of Sicily. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive yellowish-green lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in areas with high altitude and limited vegetation. It has a short flowering period, usually in late spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
