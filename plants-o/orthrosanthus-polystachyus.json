    "intro": "Orthrosanthus polystachyus, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
