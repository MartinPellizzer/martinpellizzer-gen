    "intro": "Oxalis lateriflora, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds. Oxalis lateriflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to enrich soil with nitrogen."
