    "intro": "Oxytropis dorogostajskyi, commonly known as the Dorogostajsky's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
