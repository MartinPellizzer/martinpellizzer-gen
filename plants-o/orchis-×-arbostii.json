    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 arbostii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in woodland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Its morphology reflects a blend of characteristics from both parent species, showcasing genetic diversity in the Orchis genus. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern in certain regions."
