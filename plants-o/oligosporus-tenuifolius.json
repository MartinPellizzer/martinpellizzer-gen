    "intro": "Oligosporus tenuifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sporegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Oligosporus tenuifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
