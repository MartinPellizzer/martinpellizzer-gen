    "intro": "Ormosia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan ormosia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly in southern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. Ormosia oaxacana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in forest regeneration."
