    "intro": "Ononis crassifolia var. intricata, commonly known as the intricate bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
