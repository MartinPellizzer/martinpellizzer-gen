    "intro": "Ornithopus sativus subsp. isthmocarpus, commonly known as the coastal rocket, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Europe. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its upright stem and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant has pinnately divided leaves and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky shores. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for coastal stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
