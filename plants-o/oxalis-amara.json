    "intro": "Oxalis amara, commonly known as sourgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which store water, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Oxalis amara is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it forms dense mats. Its botanical features make it an attractive yet potentially invasive species in certain regions."
