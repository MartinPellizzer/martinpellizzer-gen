    "intro": "Ozothamnus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty fumitory, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It features wiry, branching stems that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, glandular inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, hairy glands. Ozothamnus ferrugineus is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions."
