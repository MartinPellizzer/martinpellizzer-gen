    "intro": "Oxalis aridicola, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features fleshy, water-storing leaves that are typically heart-shaped or oval in form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Oxalis aridicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
