    "intro": "Oberonia raoi, commonly known as the Rao's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure and a compact, epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the monsoon season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with a dense layer of fine, velvety pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia raoi is considered a conservation concern."
