    "intro": "Ononis antennata var. psammophila, commonly known as sand spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. This variant is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in semi-arid regions."
