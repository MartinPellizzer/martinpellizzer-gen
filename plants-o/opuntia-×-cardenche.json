    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 cardenche, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems called cladodes. These stems are covered in spines and are adapted for water storage, allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has been used for food and traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
