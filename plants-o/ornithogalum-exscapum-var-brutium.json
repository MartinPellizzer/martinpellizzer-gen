    "intro": "Ornithogalum exscapum var. brutium, commonly known as the red belladonna lily, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive red or purple tinge at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
