    "intro": "Ornithogalum aridum, commonly known as the desert cowbell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with a bell-shaped structure, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ornithogalum aridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
