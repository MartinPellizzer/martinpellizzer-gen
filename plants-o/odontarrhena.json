    "intro": "Odontarrhena, commonly known as the African grass or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The plants are typically herbaceous, with erect stems and alternate leaves that are often hairy. They produce small, yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, and their seeds are dispersed by wind. Odontarrhena species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions."
