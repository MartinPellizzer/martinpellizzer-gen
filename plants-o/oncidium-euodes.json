    "intro": "Oncidium euodes, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers emit a sweet, spicy scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Oncidium euodes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
