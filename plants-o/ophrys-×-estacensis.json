    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 estacensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring calcareous soils. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange with intricate patterns, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. As a hybrid, it exhibits a range of morphological and genetic variability, making it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
