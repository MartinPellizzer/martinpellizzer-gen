    "intro": "Oncidium bismarckii, commonly known as the Bismarck orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in varied environmental conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or other surfaces rather than in soil. Oncidium bismarckii is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and striking appearance."
