    "intro": "Olearia ramosissima, commonly known as the silverweed tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast. The plant has small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its silvery appearance. Olearia ramosissima is often found in coastal and lowland areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
