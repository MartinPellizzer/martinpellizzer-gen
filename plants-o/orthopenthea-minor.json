    "intro": "Orthopenthea minor, commonly known as the small orthopenthea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
