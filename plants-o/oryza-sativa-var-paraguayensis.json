    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. paraguayensis, commonly known as the Paraguay rice, is a lesser-known variant of the rice species native to South America. It is characterized by its short stature and robust growth, often thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, fragrant grains that are typically harvested when they are still in the milk stage. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a panicle inflorescence with numerous small flowers. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to different environmental conditions."
