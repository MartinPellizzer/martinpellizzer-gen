    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. mitis, commonly known as the soft thornweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, pale green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water storage. The variety 'mitis' is distinguished by its softer, less prickly stems compared to the typical form of Ononis spinosa."
