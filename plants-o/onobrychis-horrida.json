    "intro": "Onobrychis horrida, commonly known as the thorny clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems that bear small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Onobrychis horrida is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and as a forage plant."
