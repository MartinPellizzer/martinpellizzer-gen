    "intro": "Ophrys attica subsp. rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specialized pollination mechanism and habitat requirements."
