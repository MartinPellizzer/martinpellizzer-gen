    "intro": "Onobrychis halysensis, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry and rocky soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread."
