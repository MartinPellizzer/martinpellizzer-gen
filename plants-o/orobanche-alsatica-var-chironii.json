    "intro": "Orobanche alsatica var. chironii, commonly known as the pale broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or pale green stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
