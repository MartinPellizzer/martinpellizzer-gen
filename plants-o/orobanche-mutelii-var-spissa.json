    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. spissa, commonly known as the rough common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and the Middle East. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a complex life cycle that involves germinating in response to chemical signals from its host. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria, which attach to the roots of host plants and extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host species."
