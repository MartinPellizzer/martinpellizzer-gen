    "intro": "Onobrychis aucheri subsp. psammophila, commonly known as the sand clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for improving soil fertility in degraded areas."
