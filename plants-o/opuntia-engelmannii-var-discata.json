    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. discata, commonly known as the Englemann's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also noted for its ability to form dense stands, which can impact local ecosystems."
