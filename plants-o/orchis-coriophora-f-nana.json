It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender stems and small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is notable for its role in supporting pollinators and its ecological significance in temperate regions."
