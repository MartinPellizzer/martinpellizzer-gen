    "intro": "Ostrya vulgaris, commonly known as the European hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, smooth, gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Ostrya vulgaris is valued for its hard, durable wood and its ability to tolerate urban environments."
