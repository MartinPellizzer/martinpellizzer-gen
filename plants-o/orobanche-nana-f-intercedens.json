    "intro": "Orobanche nana f. intercedens, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its small, erect stems and pale yellow or white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often in disturbed or open areas. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
