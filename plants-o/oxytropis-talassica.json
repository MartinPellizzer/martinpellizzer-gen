    "intro": "Oxytropis talassica, commonly known as the coastal locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the steppes and semi-desert regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Oxytropis talassica is known for its toxic alkaloids, which can affect livestock if ingested."
