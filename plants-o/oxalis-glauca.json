    "intro": "Oxalis glauca, commonly known as blue wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically a vibrant green with a bluish tinge, and its small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis glauca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings. It is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable conditions."
