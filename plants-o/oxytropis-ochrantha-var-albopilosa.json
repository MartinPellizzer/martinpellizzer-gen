    "intro": "Oxytropis ochrantha var. albopilosa, commonly known as the white-haired bur pea, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, and its stems are often covered in dense, white, silky hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The seeds are enclosed in hairy, pod-like structures that help in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
