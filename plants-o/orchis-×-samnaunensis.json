    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 samnaunensis, commonly known as the Samnaun orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Alps, particularly in Switzerland and Austria. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects. Orchis \u00d7 samnaunensis is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
