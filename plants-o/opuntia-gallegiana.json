    "intro": "Opuntia gallegiana, commonly known as the Gallegan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Opuntia gallegiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
