    "intro": "Onobrychis mucronifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings as a forage plant."
