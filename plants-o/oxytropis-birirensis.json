    "intro": "Oxytropis birirensis, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis birirensis is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
