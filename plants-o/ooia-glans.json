    "intro": "Ooia glans, commonly known as the golden leaf tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy leaves that emit a faint, sweet fragrance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Ooia glans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for both its ornamental and practical uses."
