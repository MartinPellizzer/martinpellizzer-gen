It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, unbranched stem that bears a cluster of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
