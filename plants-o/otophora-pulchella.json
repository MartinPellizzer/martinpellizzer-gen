    "intro": "Otophora pulchella, commonly known as the beautiful cup lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive, cup-like shape with a smooth, often brightly colored upper surface. The thallus is typically green or yellowish, and it contains a dense layer of algae that contributes to its vibrant appearance. This lichen is often found on decaying wood or stone in temperate forests. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for environmental health and moisture levels."
