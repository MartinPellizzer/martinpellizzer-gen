It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green, often arranged in a raceme. Its leaves are strap-shaped and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium kramerianum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
