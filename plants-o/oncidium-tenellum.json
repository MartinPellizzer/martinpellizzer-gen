    "intro": "Oncidium tenellum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are strap-like, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oncidium tenellum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
