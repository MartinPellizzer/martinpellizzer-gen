    "intro": "Odontadenia campanulata, commonly known as the mountain devil, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive appearance, featuring a thick, fleshy stem and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Odontadenia campanulata is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands."
