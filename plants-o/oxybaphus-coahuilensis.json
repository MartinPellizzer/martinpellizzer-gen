    "intro": "Oxybaphus coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuilan bursage, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Oxybaphus coahuilensis is well adapted to survive in extreme heat and drought conditions."
