    "intro": "Oreophilus platysepalus, commonly known as the flat-sepal orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, flat, ovate sepals that are often brightly colored. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
