It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
