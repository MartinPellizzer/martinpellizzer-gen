    "intro": "Onobrychis viciifolia proles albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered sainfoin, is a leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
