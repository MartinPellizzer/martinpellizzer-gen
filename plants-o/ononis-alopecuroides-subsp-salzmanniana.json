It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
