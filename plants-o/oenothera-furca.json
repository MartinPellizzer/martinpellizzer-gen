    "intro": "Oenothera furca, commonly known as the forked evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its scientific name, Oenothera, refers to the Greek word for \"wine,\" possibly due to the reddish color of its seeds. Oenothera furca is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, open habitats."
