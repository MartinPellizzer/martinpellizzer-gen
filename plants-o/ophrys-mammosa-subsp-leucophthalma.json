    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. leucophthalma, commonly known as the white-hooded bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a pouch-like structure called a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to white in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
