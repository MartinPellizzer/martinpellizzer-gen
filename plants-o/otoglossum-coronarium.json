    "intro": "Otoglossum coronarium, commonly known as the crown orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinctive crown-like structure at the base of the petals. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. Otoglossum coronarium is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
