It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green to orange flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and the leaves are strap-like, often with a waxy coating. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to thrive."
