    "intro": "Osmunda brayeri, commonly known as the northern royal fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Osmunda brayeri thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
