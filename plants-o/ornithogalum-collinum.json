    "intro": "Ornithogalum collinum, commonly known as the mountain star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Ornithogalum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early blooming flowers."
