    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 lydia, commonly known as the Lydia orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe, particularly found in regions like Greece and Italy. The plant features a rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Its most distinctive characteristic is its intricate, bee-pollinated flower, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. This botanical feature makes it a fascinating subject in the study of plant mimicry and evolutionary adaptations."
