    "intro": "Oxytropis hippolyti var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its trifoliate leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the pods contain several elliptical seeds. Oxytropis hippolyti var. pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
