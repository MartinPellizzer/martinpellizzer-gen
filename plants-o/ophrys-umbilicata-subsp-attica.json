    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. attica, commonly known as the Attic Helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its unique, lip-like structure that mimics the appearance of female insects, a feature used in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and forest floors. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other members of the Ophrys genus."
