    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. sappho, commonly known as the Sappho bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a unique blend of sweet and spicy scents to attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
