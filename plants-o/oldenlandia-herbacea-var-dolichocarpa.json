    "intro": "Oldenlandia herbacea var. dolichocarpa, commonly known as the slender cat's-tail, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, ascending stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which are often mistaken for cat's tails due to their fluffy appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
