    "intro": "Oxytropis gmelinii var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
