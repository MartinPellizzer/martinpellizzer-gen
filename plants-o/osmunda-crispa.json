    "intro": "Osmunda crispa, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a central trunk-like stem covered in a mass of roots. Osmunda crispa is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
