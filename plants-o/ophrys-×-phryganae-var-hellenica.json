    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 phryganae var. hellenica, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Greece. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats across the Mediterranean region."
