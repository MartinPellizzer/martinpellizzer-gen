    "intro": "Oxygraphis breviscapa, commonly known as the short-capped oxygraphis, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in East Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its compact stature and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
