It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems known as cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and has spines for protection against herbivores. Opuntia sierralagunensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
