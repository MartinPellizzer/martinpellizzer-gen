    "intro": "Oreopanax obtusifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf oreopanax, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
