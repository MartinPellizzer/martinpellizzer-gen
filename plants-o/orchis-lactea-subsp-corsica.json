    "intro": "Orchis lactea subsp. corsica, commonly known as the Corsican milk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which are often tinged with green, and its unique morphology that reflects its adaptation to specific ecological niches. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations with fungi, which are essential for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
