    "intro": "Oenothera biennis subsp. muricata, commonly known as the rough evening primrose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its capsules contain numerous small, oily seeds that are used in various traditional and commercial applications. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, muricate (warty) texture on the stem and leaves, setting it apart from other members of the Oenothera species."
