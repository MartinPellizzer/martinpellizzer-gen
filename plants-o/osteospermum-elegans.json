    "intro": "Osteospermum elegans, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant produces a distinctive, hard, woody core in its seed head, which gives it its genus name \"Osteospermum,\" meaning \"bone seed.\" It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Osteospermum elegans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
