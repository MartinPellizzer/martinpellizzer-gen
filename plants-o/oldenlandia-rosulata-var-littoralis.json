    "intro": "Oldenlandia rosulata var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and restoration projects."
