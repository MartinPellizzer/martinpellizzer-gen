    "intro": "Ochnella madagascariensis var. humblotiana, commonly known as the Madagascan ochna, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical capsules containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
