    "intro": "Orthaea ignea, commonly known as the fireweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in tundra environments. Its leaves are alternate and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Orthaea ignea plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its cold, harsh habitat."
