    "intro": "Oxalis cernua f. microphylla, commonly known as the miniature wood sorrel, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish tint, and its flowers are small, five-petaled, and typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its foliage and flowers make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded rockeries."
