It has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically narrow and have a distinct striped pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for underwater pollination. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and prevent erosion in marine environments. Ochetocarpus striata plays an important role in supporting marine biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem health."
