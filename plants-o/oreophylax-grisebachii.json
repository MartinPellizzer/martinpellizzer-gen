    "intro": "Oreophylax grisebachii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Oreophylax grisebachii is an important species for local biodiversity and is often found in alpine meadows."
