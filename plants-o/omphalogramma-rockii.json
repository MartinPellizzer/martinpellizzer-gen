    "intro": "Omphalogramma rockii, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually pale green or white with a slight fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Omphalogramma rockii is considered a rare and endangered species."
