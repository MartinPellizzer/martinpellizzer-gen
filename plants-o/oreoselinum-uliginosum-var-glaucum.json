    "intro": "Oreoselinum uliginosum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous marsh caraway, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, aromatic stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a distinctive grayish-blue hue due to the presence of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and have a strong, aromatic scent, typical of the Apiaceae family. This variety is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies."
