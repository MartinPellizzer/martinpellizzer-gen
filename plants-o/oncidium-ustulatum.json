    "intro": "Oncidium ustulatum, commonly known as the Fire Spike, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful spikes of flowers that can range from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or green tips. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its flowers are long-lasting and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Oncidium ustulatum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
