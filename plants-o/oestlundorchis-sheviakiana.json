    "intro": "Oestlundorchis sheviakiana, commonly known as the Sheviakova's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Siberia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its flowers are typically pollinated by specific insects, reflecting its ecological niche. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
