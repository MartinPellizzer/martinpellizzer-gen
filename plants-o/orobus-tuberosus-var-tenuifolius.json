    "intro": "Orobus tuberosus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed tuberous orobus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a robust tuberous root system that stores nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers with distinctive, tubular corollas. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments."
