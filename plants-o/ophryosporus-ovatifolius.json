It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its ovate, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
