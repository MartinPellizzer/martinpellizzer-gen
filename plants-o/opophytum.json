It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. These plants are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Opophytum species typically have succulent leaves that help them conserve water. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to their ecological importance in their native habitats."
