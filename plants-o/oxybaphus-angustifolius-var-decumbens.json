    "intro": "Oxybaphus angustifolius var. decumbens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oxybaphus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they tend to be arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, typically during the cooler months. This plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland or rocky habitats."
