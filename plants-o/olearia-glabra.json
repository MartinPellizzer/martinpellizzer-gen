    "intro": "Olearia glabra, commonly known as the silver olearia, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine regions. Olearia glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
