    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a slender, hairy stem that bears a single, showy pink or purple flower with a distinctive lip. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. The plant is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
