It is characterized by its dense, branching habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Oxytropis ramosissima plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
