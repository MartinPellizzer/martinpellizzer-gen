It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are fleshy and store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit."
