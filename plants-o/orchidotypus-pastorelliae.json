It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically display a combination of white and purple hues. Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its challenging habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
