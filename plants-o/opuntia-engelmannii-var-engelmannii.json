    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. engelmannii, commonly known as the Engelmann prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. The species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food in certain regions."
