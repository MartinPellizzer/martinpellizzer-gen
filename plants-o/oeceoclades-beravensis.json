    "intro": "Oeceoclades beravensis, commonly known as the Berava orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oeceoclades beravensis is considered a conservation concern."
