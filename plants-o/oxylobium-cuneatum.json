It is a member of the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Oxylobium cuneatum is often found in chaparral and woodland environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
