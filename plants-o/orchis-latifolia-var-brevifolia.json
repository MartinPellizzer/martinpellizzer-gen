    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wet meadows and marshy habitats in Europe. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a basal rosette of leaves and a spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
