    "intro": "Ononis arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider's web sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features wiry, branching stems covered in small, hooked hairs that give it a distinctive, spiny appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as legumes. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
