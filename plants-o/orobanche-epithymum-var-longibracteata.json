    "intro": "Orobanche epithymum var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bracted broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to parasitize its host. The plant produces small, often yellow or brown flowers, and its inflorescence is typically clustered. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing on the roots of various grasses and shrubs. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
