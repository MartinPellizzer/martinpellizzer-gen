    "intro": "Oxytenanthera lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in well-drained, moist soil. Oxytenanthera lacei is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
