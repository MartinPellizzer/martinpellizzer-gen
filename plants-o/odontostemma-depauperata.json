    "intro": "Odontostemma depauperata, commonly known as the slender stiltgrass, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, low-light habitat."
