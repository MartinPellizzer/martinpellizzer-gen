    "intro": "Odontotrichum scabrum, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a flowering plant species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Odontotrichum scabrum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
