It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Oxytropis demidovii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
