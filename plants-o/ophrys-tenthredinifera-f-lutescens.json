    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera f. lutescens, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a bee, a feature evolved to attract pollinators through mimicry. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and heathlands, thriving in sunny, well-drained soils. Its flowers are predominantly yellow, with a distinctive, bee-like hood and lip that enhances its deceptive allure. Due to its specialized habitat and declining populations, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
