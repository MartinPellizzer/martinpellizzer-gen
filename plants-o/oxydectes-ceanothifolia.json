    "intro": "Oxydectes ceanothifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf oxydectes, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often aromatic leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
