    "intro": "Opuntia megacantha, commonly known as the giant hedgehog cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, cylindrical stems that are covered in spiny, glochids, and small, segmented pads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red fruits. Opuntia megacantha is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
