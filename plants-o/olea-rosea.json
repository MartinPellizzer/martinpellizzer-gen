    "intro": "Olea rosea, commonly known as the rose laurel, is a species of flowering shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, black berries that are edible but typically not consumed by humans. Olea rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
