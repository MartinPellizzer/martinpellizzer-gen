    "intro": "Odontophyllum weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor in steep terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
