It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and often used in traditional cuisine. Opuntia depauperata plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
