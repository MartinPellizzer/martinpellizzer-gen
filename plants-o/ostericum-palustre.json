    "intro": "Ostericum palustre, commonly known as marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Ostericum palustre is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
