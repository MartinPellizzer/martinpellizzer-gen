    "intro": "Oenothera \u00d7 cantabrigiana, commonly known as the Cambridge evening primrose, is a hybrid species native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves and a trailing habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread and establish in new areas."
