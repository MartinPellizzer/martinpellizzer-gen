    "intro": "Oxalis madrensis, commonly known as the Mexican wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Oxalis madrensis thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
