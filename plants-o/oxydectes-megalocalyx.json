It is characterized by its large, showy, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant has a woody stem and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bats due to their shape and nectar-rich structure.
