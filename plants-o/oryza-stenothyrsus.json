It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are adapted for wind pollination. Oryza stenothyrsus is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential agricultural relevance."
