    "intro": "Osyris nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal osyris, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is a small shrub that typically grows in moist, forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant features simple, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Osyris nepalensis is characterized by its fibrous root system, which helps it anchor in rocky or clay soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
