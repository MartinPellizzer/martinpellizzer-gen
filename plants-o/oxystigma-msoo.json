It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub, with leaves that are often marked with distinctive patterns or spots. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oxystigma msoo is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
