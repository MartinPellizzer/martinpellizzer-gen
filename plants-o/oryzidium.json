    "intro": "Oryzidium, commonly known as the rice fern, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori on the underside of its leaves. Oryzidium thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its simple structure and rapid growth make it a common species in both wild and cultivated settings."
