    "intro": "Oxalis cataractae, commonly known as the water oxalis, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near waterfalls or in streamside habitats. Its scientific name, *Oxalis cataractae*, reflects its association with waterfalls, as \"cataractae\" refers to waterfalls in Latin. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
