    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza aggregata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, often forming dense clusters. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems. Ophiorrhiza aggregata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
