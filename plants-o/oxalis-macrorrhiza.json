    "intro": "Oxalis macrorrhiza, commonly known as the giant wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a dense rosette of heart-shaped, fleshy leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Oxalis macrorrhiza is also notable for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content."
