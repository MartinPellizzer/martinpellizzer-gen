    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 monticaula, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive lip. This plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring well-drained, calcareous soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude environments."
