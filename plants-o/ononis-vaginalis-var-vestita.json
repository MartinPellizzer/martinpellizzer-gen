    "intro": "Ononis vaginalis var. vestita, commonly known as the white sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial herb native to sandy and gravelly soils in the western United States. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, alternate leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize loose, nutrient-poor soils, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion."
