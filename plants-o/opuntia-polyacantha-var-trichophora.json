It is characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems that are covered in dense, soft spines and hair-like structures. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sun exposure. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
