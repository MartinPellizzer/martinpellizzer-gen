    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. pyrocarpa, commonly known as the fire-fruit rice, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of rice. This plant is characterized by its distinctive, fiery red or orange-colored grains, which give it its unique appearance. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective hull, typical of many rice species."
