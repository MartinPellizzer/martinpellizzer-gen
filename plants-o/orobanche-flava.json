    "intro": "Orobanche flava, commonly known as the yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
