    "intro": "Oncidium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaf orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pendulous spikes of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive red lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium brevifolium is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
