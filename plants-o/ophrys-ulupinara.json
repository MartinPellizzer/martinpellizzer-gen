    "intro": "Ophrys ulupinara, commonly known as the Ulupina bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Ophrys ulupinara is considered a vulnerable species."
