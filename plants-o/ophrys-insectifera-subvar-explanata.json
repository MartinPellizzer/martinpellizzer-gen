    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subvar. explanata, commonly known as the honey orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which closely resembles a bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration, and it often has a subtle scent that mimics the pheromones of female bees. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat loss, this subvariety is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
