    "intro": "Opuntia ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments, known as cladodes, which are adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. Its spines are modified branches, providing defense against herbivores. Opuntia ferox is well-suited to harsh environments due to its succulent structure and ability to thrive with minimal water."
