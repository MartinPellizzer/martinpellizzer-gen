    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 apicula nothosubsp. fabrei, commonly known as the Fabre's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like flower morphology, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This nothosubspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique hybrid origin and specialized pollination mechanism."
