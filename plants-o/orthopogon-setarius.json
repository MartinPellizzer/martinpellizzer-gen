    "intro": "Orthopogon setarius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually arranged in a triangular cross-section, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Orthopogon setarius plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
