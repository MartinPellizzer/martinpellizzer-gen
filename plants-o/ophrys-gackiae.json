    "intro": "Ophrys gackiae, commonly known as the Gacki's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that closely resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ophrys gackiae is considered a vulnerable species."
