    "intro": "Oreodendron, commonly known as the mountain heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family, Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to temperate and alpine regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Oreodendron species are characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, some species are cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
