    "intro": "Olgaea vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's olgaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Olgaea vvedenskyi is considered a species of conservation concern."
