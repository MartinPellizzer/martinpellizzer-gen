It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Oncinema thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its ease of care and ornamental value."
