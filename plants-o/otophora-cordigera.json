    "intro": "Otophora cordigera, commonly known as the heart-shaped liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thallus that is often heart-shaped, giving it its common name, and is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. Otophora cordigera is characterized by its simple, non-vascular structure and its ability to absorb water and nutrients directly through its surface. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
