It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with dry summers and mild, wet winters. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal properties."
