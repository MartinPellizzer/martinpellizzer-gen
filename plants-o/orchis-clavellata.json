    "intro": "Orchis clavellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems topped with a single spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is broader than the other petals, and the plant is known for its delicate appearance. Orchis clavellata is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in calcareous soils."
