    "intro": "Oxalis gregaria, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fleshy, waxy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. Its succulent leaves and stems store moisture, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Oxalis gregaria is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
