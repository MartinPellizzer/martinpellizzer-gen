    "intro": "Oeceoclades petiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oeceoclades petiolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
