It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other well-known herbs like mint and lavender. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique fragrance and limited distribution, Ocimum dinteri is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
