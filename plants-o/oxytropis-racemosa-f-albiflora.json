    "intro": "Oxytropis racemosa f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
