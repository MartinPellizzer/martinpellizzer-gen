    "intro": "Ophrys crassicornis, commonly known as the broad-horned orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem. Ophrys crassicornis is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is often found in Mediterranean climates."
