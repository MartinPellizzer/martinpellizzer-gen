    "intro": "Oxalis prichardii, commonly known as the desert wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Oxalis prichardii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
