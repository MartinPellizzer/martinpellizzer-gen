    "intro": "Ophrys posteria, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often forming a dense rosette at the base. The flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike of flowers that attract male bees through mimicry."
