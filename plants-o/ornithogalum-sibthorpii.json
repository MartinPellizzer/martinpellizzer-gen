    "intro": "Ornithogalum sibthorpii, commonly known as the African star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the winter months. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its ability to store water in its underground bulb, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution."
