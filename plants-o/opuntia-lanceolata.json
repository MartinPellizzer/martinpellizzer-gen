    "intro": "Opuntia lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia lanceolata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
