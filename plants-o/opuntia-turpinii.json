    "intro": "Opuntia turpinii, commonly known as the Turpin prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it both distinctive and defensive. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are typically orange or red in color. Opuntia turpinii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in its ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
