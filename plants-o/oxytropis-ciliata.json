    "intro": "Oxytropis ciliata, commonly known as the silky goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in spring. Oxytropis ciliata is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can often be found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant."
