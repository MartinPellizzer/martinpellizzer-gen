    "intro": "Ononis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky willow or sticky trefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-gray hue. Ononis glutinosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides."
