    "intro": "Otoglossum scansor, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or branches. The flowers are usually short-lived, blooming briefly before withering, which is a common trait among many orchid species."
