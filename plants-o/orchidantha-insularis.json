    "intro": "Orchidantha insularis, commonly known as the island orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to specific island ecosystems. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soil conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchidantha insularis is considered a vulnerable species."
