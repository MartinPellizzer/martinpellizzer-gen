It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with prominent veins, and produces clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and prolonged flowering period."
