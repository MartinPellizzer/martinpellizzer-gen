    "intro": "Ornithoglossum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Paracryphiaceae and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that resemble a bird's tongue, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are usually blue or violet in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ornithoglossum parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
