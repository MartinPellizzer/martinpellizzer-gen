    "intro": "Ophrys cretica subsp. karpathensis, commonly known as the Karpathian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Greek island of Karpathos. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils in open, sunny habitats. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the bee mimicry. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
