    "intro": "Onobrychis eriophora, commonly known as the narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, followed by small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Onobrychis eriophora is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open woods, and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
