    "intro": "Ophrys quarteirae, commonly known as the Balkan bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Ophrys quarteirae is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
