    "intro": "Ononis arthropodia, commonly known as the woolly bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard, many-seeded fruits known as achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
