    "intro": "Onychium moupinense var. ipii, commonly known as the Moupin onychium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of white hair, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
