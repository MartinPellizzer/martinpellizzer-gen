It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and showy purple or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's structure and appearance make it both a distinctive wildflower and a potential invasive species in some regions."
