    "intro": "Ochna longifolia, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. Ochna longifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitats."
