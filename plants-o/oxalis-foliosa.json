    "intro": "Oxalis foliosa, commonly known as the leafy wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its stems are usually hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxalis foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowers."
