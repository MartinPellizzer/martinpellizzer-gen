    "intro": "Oberonia platychila, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically less showy compared to other orchid species. Oberonia platychila thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
