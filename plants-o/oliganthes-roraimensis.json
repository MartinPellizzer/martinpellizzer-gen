    "intro": "Oliganthes roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that often display vibrant colors, such as red and yellow, which are adapted for attracting specific pollinators. The plant thrives in the nutrient-poor soils of the high-altitude tepuis, relying on mycorrhizal associations to obtain essential nutrients. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to the humid, misty conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
