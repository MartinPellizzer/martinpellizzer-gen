    "intro": "Ornithogalum witteklipense, commonly known as the Witteklip bulbous plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, narrow leaves and showy white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical bulbs that serve as storage organs and enable it to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent invasiveness."
