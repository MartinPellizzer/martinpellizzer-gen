    "intro": "Oncidium lisae, commonly known as the Lisae Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, colorful flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has strap-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light. Oncidium lisae is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in variable conditions. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
