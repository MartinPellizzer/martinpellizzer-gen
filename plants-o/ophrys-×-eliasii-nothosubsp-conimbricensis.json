    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 eliasii nothosubsp. conimbricensis, commonly known as the Conimbricenses Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to Portugal. It belongs to the Ophrys genus, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant features a single, lance-shaped leaf and produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive, bee-mimicking lip. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a protected species in its native region."
