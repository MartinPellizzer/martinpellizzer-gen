    "intro": "Oxylobus preecei, commonly known as the Preece's oxylobus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a slightly waxy texture, and it produces fragrant, white or pale yellow blooms. Oxylobus preecei is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its harsh native habitat."
