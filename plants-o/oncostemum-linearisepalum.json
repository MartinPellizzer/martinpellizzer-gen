    "intro": "Oncostemum linearisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sheath sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that form a dense, grass-like foliage, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Oncostemum linearisepalum plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
