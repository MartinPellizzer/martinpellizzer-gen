    "intro": "Oreocarya caespitosa, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in steep, unstable terrain. Oreocarya caespitosa is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and slopes above timberline."
