    "intro": "Onobrychis pulchella var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
