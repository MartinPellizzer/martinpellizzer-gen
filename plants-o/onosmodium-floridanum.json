    "intro": "Onosmodium floridanum, commonly known as the Florida sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as sand dunes and coastal plains. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
