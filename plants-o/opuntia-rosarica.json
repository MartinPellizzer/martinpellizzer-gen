    "intro": "Opuntia rosarica, commonly known as the Rosalina prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia rosarica is adapted to arid environments and has a succulent structure that allows it to store water efficiently. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
