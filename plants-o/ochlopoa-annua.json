    "intro": "Ochlopoa annua, commonly known as the annual sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its growth cycle is annual, meaning it completes its life cycle within one growing season. Ochlopoa annua plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
