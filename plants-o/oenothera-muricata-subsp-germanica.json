    "intro": "Oenothera muricata subsp. germanica, commonly known as the German evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of stems, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders."
