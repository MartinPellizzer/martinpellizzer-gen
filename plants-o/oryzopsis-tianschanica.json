    "intro": "Oryzopsis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia, particularly the Tianshan mountain range. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Oryzopsis tianschanica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife in its native habitat."
