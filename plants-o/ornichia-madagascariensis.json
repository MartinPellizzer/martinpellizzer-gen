    "intro": "Ornichia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a prominent lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the humid forests of its native habitat. Its flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink, and are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
