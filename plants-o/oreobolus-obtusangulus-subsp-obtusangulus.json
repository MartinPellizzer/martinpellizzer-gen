    "intro": "Oreobolus obtusangulus subsp. obtusangulus, commonly known as the blunt-angled sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is often found in coastal dunes or inland sand plains. This subspecies is characterized by its robust, compact growth form and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
