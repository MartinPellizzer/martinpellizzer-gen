    "intro": "Oriastrum leucocephalum, commonly known as the whitehead globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its showy, yellow flowers are clustered in globular inflorescences, which are a distinctive characteristic. Oriastrum leucocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
