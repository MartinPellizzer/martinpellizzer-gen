    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. dextrinosa, commonly known as wild rice, is a grass species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, branched inflorescence and small, rice-like grains. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The grains, which are rich in nutrients, are harvested when they are mature and have developed a hard outer layer."
