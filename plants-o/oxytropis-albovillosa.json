It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis albovillosa is also known for its toxicity to livestock, making it a significant concern in rangeland management."
