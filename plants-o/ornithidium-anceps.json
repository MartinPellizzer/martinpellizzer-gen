    "intro": "Ornithidium anceps, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which resemble a bird's foot, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil fertility. Ornithidium anceps is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
