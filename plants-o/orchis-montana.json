    "intro": "Orchis montana, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist meadows and wetlands in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Orchis montana is often found in nutrient-rich, calcareous soils and is adapted to wet or semi-aquatic habitats. Its presence is an indicator of undisturbed, ecologically rich environments."
