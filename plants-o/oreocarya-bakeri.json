    "intro": "Oreocarya bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's oreocarya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and its leaves are leathery and dark green. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocarya bakeri is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
