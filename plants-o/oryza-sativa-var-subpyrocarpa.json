    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. subpyrocarpa, commonly known as the fire-encrusted rice, is a less commonly cultivated variety of rice characterized by its unique botanical features. This variety is distinguished by its thick, reddish-brown husk, which gives it its name and sets it apart from other rice types. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, requiring warm temperatures and ample water for optimal growth. Its grains are generally smaller and have a higher protein content compared to common rice varieties. Due to its rarity and specific cultivation requirements, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
