    "intro": "Oncidium articulatum, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. The plant has strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native humid environments. Oncidium articulatum is a pseudobulbous orchid, meaning it has thickened stems that store water and nutrients. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
