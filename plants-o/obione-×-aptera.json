It is characterized by its elegant, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette. The botanical interest of Obione \u00d7 aptera lies in its genetic diversity and the unique floral morphology resulting from hybridization."
