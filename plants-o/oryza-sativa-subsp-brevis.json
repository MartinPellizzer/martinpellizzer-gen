    "intro": "Oryza sativa subsp. brevis, commonly known as short-grain rice, is a subspecies of rice characterized by its shorter, plumper grains compared to long-grain varieties. It is native to Asia and is cultivated for its high starch content, which gives it a sticky texture when cooked. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with slender stalks and narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces grains that are rich in carbohydrates and proteins. This subspecies is particularly valued in traditional cuisines for its use in dishes like sushi and rice pudding."
