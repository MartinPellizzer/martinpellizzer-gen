    "intro": "Oxytropis sylinchanensis, commonly known as the Sylinchan locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to pale purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
