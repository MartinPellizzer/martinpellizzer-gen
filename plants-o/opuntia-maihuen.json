    "intro": "Opuntia maihuen, commonly known as the \"peyote cactus,\" is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus with flat, paddle-like stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, red fruits containing seeds. Opuntia maihuen is also known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of mescaline in its roots and stems. It plays a significant role in the cultural and spiritual practices of indigenous communities in the region."
