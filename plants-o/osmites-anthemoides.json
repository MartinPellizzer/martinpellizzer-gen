    "intro": "Osmites anthemoides, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Osmites anthemoides is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
