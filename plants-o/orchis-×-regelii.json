    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 regelii, commonly known as the Regel's orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe, typically found in moist meadows and woodlands. The plant produces tall, erect stems with a single, showy violet or purple flower that has a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects attracted by their nectar. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinator populations."
