It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, elongated pods that contain small, hard seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Oryctina pedunculata is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
