    "intro": "Oxytropis sylvicola, commonly known as the woodland milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Oxytropis sylvicola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
