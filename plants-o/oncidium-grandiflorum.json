    "intro": "Oncidium grandiflorum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching stems and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant produces numerous pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in bright, indirect light. Its flowers typically bloom in spring or early summer, and it is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Oncidium grandiflorum requires well-draining soil and regular watering to maintain optimal growth."
