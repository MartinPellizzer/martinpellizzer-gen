    "intro": "Ophiopogon japonicus, commonly known as Japanese spathiphyllum or evergreen lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features strap-like, dark green leaves that form a dense rosette, and it produces attractive, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for shaded gardens. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form thickets. Ophiopogon japonicus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
