    "intro": "Ornithogalum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of three white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a small, spherical bulb that stores nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Ornithogalum triflorum is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
