    "intro": "Onobrychis ebenoides, commonly known as the yellow sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Onobrychis ebenoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
