    "intro": "Ornithocephalus brachyceras, commonly known as the narrow-capsuled orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
