    "intro": "Ocimum hispidum, commonly known as hairy basil, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in terminal clusters. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Ocimum hispidum is also valued in culinary applications, though it is less commonly used than other basil varieties."
