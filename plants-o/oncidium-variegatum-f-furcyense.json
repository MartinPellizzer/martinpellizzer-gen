    "intro": "Oncidium variegatum f. furcyense, commonly known as the Variegated Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, often variegated foliage and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The f. furcyense form is notable for its unique leaf patterns and enhanced flowering characteristics compared to the species."
