    "intro": "Orchis pyramidalis var. sommieriana, commonly known as the Pyramidal Orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, pyramid-shaped inflorescence that bears numerous small, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has a short growing season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
