    "intro": "Oncidium scabripes, commonly known as the scabrous orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain water in its natural habitat. Oncidium scabripes is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
