    "intro": "Orobanche rapum-genistae subsp. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate broom weed, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale in color. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural areas. Its botanical structure is adapted for parasitism, with specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system."
