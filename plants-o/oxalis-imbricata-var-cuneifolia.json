It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display."
