    "intro": "Opuntia macrocentra var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green and covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
