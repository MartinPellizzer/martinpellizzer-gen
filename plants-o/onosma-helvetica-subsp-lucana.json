    "intro": "Onosma helvetica subsp. lucana, commonly known as the Alpine onosma, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
