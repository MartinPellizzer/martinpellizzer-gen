    "intro": "Orchis mascula subsp. signifera, commonly known as the male orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a unique lip structure that aids in pollination. This subspecies is often found in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
