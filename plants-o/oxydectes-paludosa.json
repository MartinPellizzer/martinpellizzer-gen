    "intro": "Oxydectes paludosa, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has upright, hairy stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oxydectes paludosa plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates."
