    "intro": "Ocymastrum junceum, commonly known as the slender bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in marshy areas, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Ocymastrum junceum plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and waterfowl."
