    "intro": "Orontium siculum var. tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted burr plant, is a variant of the common burr plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant produces distinctive, spirally twisted burrs that can persist in the soil for extended periods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often prostrate or semi-erect. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecy."
