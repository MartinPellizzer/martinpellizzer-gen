    "intro": "Onopordum bracteatum subsp. creticum, commonly known as Cretan thistle, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. Its structure includes a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its adaptive features and ecological role in its native habitat."
