    "intro": "Ophrys basilissa, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, which features a dark, velvety lip that resembles a female bee. Its botanical structure includes a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Ophrys basilissa thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands."
