It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Oenothera perennis var. typica is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
