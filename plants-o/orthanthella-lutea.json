    "intro": "Orthanthella lutea, commonly known as the yellow orthanthella, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and delicate, yellowish-green leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, which is a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
