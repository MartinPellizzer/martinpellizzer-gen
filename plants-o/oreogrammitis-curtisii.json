    "intro": "Oreogrammitis curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Oreogrammitis curtisii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded, moist gardens."
