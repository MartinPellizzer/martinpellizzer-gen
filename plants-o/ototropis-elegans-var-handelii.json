It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several whorls of blue to purple florets. Ototropis elegans var. handelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
