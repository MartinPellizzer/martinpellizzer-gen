    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. leochroma, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which includes a vivid yellow and brownish-green pouch-shaped labellum. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, which is pollinated through a unique mimicry mechanism that attracts male bees. The species is known for its ecological importance as a food source for certain pollinators and as an indicator of habitat quality."
