    "intro": "Ophioglossum trilokinathii, commonly known as the Trilocanathii adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant features a short, underground rhizome with a single, erect, leaf-like structure called a sporophyll. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are arranged along the sporophyll. This species is of significant botanical interest due to its evolutionary significance and limited distribution."
