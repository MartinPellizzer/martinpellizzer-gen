    "intro": "Oxalis pearsallensis, commonly known as the Pearsall's wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins that resemble those of a maple leaf, and it produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense ground cover. Oxalis pearsallensis is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
