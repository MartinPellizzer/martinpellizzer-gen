    "intro": "Ornithogalum baeticum, commonly known as the Baetican star-of-Bethleem, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs in spring, and it is often found in mountainous regions of southern Spain. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
