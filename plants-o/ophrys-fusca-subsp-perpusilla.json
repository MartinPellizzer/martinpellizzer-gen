    "intro": "Ophrys fusca subsp. perpusilla, commonly known as the lesser bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often in grasslands or heathlands. Its flowers are small, usually greenish-yellow with brown markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
