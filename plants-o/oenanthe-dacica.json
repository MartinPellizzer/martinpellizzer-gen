    "intro": "Oenanthe dacica, commonly known as the Balkan water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist soils along riverbanks and lakeshores. Its small, white flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, elongated fruits. Oenanthe dacica is often found in disturbed or semi-natural environments and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and historical significance."
