    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza harrisiana, commonly known as the Harris's sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by yellowish or reddish berries. It thrives in sandy or limestone soils and is often found in tidal zones or on rocky shores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
