    "intro": "Orchis skorpili, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower that resembles a bee, which is a key adaptation for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges across Europe. Its flowering period occurs between June and August, and it relies on specific pollinators, such as bees, for reproduction. The orchid is also notable for its mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which aids in nutrient uptake."
