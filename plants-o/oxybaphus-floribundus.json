    "intro": "Oxybaphus floribundus, commonly known as the showy sandbush, is a flowering shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun. Oxybaphus floribundus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and birds."
