It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, a trait typical of many evening primrose species. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The species is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for nocturnal pollinators like moths."
