    "intro": "Ophrys querciphila, commonly known as the oak-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of an oak leaf, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, often associated with oak and beech forests. Its flowers are usually greenish-brown with intricate patterns that resemble insect bodies, attracting specific pollinators. Ophrys querciphila is a rare and protected species, reflecting its ecological significance and conservation status."
