    "intro": "Oxytropis wologdensis, commonly known as the Wologdensky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Oxytropis wologdensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
