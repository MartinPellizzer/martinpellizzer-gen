    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. almaracensis, commonly known as the Almer\u00eda bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that closely resembles a bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, producing a delicate, bee-like appearance that mimics the visual cues of its pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
