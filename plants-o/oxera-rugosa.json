It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a rough texture due to their dense pubescence. It produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky slopes."
