It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in small, short spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and it is often used in xeriscaping."
