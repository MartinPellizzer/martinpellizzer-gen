    "intro": "Omphalium scorpioides, commonly known as the scorpion liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its spirally arranged, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its leaf-like structures. Omphalium scorpioides is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
