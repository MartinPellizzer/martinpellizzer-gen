    "intro": "Ormenis pseudosantolina, commonly known as false santolina, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with a compact, mound-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in spring, which are followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its textured leaves and ability to attract beneficial insects."
