    "intro": "Oncidium humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous flower spikes that bear multiple fragrant, yellowish-green to white blossoms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal climates. Oncidium humboldtii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting flowers."
