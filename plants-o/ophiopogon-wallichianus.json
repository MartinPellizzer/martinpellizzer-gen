    "intro": "Ophiopogon wallichianus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly bluish in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in late summer, often in shades of white or pale pink, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
