    "intro": "Ornithopteris rugosula, commonly known as the rough frond fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Ornithopteris rugosula is valued both for its ornamental appearance and its role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
