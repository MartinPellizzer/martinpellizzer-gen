    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 willingiorum, commonly known as the Welsh hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Orchis mascula and Orchis morio. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial species with rhizomatous growth and is native to parts of Europe, including the UK. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in some regions."
