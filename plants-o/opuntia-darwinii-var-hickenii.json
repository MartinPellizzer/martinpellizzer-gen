    "intro": "Opuntia darwinii var. hickenii, commonly known as the Hicken's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its flowers are pollinated by nocturnal insects, primarily moths, and the fruit is edible, though often spiny. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
