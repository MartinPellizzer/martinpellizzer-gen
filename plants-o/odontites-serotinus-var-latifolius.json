    "intro": "Odontites serotinus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved toothed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in a panicle inflorescence during late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Odontites serotinus."
