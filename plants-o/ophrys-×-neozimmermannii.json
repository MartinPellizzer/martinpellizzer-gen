    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 neozimmermannii, commonly known as the New Zealand bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its intricate flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color. This species plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a subject of interest for botanists due to its unique pollination mechanism."
