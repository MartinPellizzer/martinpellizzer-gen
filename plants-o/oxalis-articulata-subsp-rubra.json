It features trifoliate leaves with reddish veins and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often reddish in color, which gives it its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
