It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when mature. Oenanthe ferulacea is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
