    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 beckeriana, commonly known as the Becker's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns and a distinct lip. Native to parts of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
