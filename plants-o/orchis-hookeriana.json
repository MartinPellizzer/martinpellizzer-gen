    "intro": "Orchis hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, often crowned with a single, showy flower that is typically pink or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a distinctive, spurred orchid flower with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
