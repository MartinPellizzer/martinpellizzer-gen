    "intro": "Opuntia engelmannii var. wootonii, commonly known as the Wooton's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it well adapted to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, enabling survival in drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species."
