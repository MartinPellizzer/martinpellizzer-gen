    "intro": "Onopordum turcicum, commonly known as Turkish thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its prickly foliage and distinctive flowers make it both a challenging and visually striking plant in the wild."
