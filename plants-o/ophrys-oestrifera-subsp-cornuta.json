    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. cornuta, commonly known as the horned bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific habitats across Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
