    "intro": "Origanum elongatum, commonly known as slender oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers in summer, which are clustered in terminal spikes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its essential oils contain compounds like carvacrol and thymol, giving it a strong, pungent aroma."
