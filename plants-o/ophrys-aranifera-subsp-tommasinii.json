    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera subsp. tommasinii, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a vivid yellow face with dark markings resembling a bee's head. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, which is designed to mimic the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas of the Alps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
