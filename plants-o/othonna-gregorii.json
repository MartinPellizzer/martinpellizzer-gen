    "intro": "Othonna gregorii, commonly known as the Gregorii's othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
