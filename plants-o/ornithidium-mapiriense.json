    "intro": "Ornithidium mapiriense, commonly known as the Mapiri orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, typically featuring a combination of white and violet hues. Its small, strap-like leaves are arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
