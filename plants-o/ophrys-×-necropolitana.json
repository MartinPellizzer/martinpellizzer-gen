    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 necropolitana, commonly known as the necropolis orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the genus Ophrys, which is known for its mimicry of female insects to attract male pollinators. The plant produces intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that are often adorned with dark patterns and a single, prominent \"lip\" to enhance its deceptive appearance. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique pollination strategy and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
