    "intro": "Ochradenus, commonly known as the desert sandthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Chenopodiaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees that are well adapted to harsh, dry environments. They have small, scale-like leaves and produce yellow or orange flowers. Ochradenus species are often used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ability to stabilize sandy soils."
