    "intro": "Octarrhena umbellulata, commonly known as the desert thyme or Arabian thyme, is a small shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Octarrhena umbellulata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
