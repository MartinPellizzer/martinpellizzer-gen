    "intro": "Ottonia hoehnei, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water in its natural habitat. Ottonia hoehnei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
