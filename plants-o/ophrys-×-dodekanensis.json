It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a bee-like lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys \u00d7 dodecanensis is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
