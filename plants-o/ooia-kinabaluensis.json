    "intro": "Ooia kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Bornean stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its restricted habitat, Ooia kinabaluensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
