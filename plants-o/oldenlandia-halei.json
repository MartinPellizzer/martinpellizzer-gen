    "intro": "Oldenlandia halei, commonly known as Hale's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It typically grows on the branches of native trees and shrubs, deriving some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are usually red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Oldenlandia halei is native to the Pacific Islands and is often found in humid, forested areas."
