It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often fragrant. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture. Oncidium manningianum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
