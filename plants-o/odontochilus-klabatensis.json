    "intro": "Odontochilus klabatensis, commonly known as the Klabat orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
