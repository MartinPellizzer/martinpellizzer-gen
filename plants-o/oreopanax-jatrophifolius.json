    "intro": "Oreopanax jatrophifolius, commonly known as the spiny arrowleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing seeds. Its stems are often armed with spines, providing a defense mechanism against herbivores. The species is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
