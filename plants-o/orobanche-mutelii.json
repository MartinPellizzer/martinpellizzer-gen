    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to September. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a nuisance in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, with seeds germinating in response to chemical signals released by the host roots."
