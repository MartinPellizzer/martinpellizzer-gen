    "intro": "Onobrychis atropatana var. vanensis, commonly known as the Vanensis burr clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces elongated, spiny pods that contain several small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
