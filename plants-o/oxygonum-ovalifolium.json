    "intro": "Oxygonum ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved waterleaf, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features basal leaves that are oval in shape with a waxy surface, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet tall, allowing it to thrive in wet or marshy environments. Oxygonum ovalifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to tolerate moist conditions."
