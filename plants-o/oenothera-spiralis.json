    "intro": "Oenothera spiralis, commonly known as spiral evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Oenothera spiralis is a perennial herb that thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
