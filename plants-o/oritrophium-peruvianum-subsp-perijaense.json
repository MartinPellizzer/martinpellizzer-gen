    "intro": "Oritrophium peruvianum subsp. perijaense, commonly known as the Peruvian hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers arranged in a dense, disk-like cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
