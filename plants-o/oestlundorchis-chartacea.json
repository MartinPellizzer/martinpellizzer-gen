It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to brownish leaves and its unique, papery, translucent flowers that resemble parchment. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose cluster and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is notable for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships, which are essential for its nutrient uptake and survival."
