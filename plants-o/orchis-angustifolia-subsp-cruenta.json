    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia subsp. cruenta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike. It lacks true leaves and instead has a photosynthetic stem, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. This subspecies is often found in calcareous soils and is relatively rare, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
