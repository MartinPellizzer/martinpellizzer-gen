    "intro": "Ononis alopecuroides proles trifoliata, commonly known as the trifoliate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, characterized by its showy, often pink or white flowers. The plant features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three lobes, which aid in reducing water loss in arid environments. Its small, clustered flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This hardy species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental value."
