    "intro": "Oenanthe biebersteinii var. grisebachii, commonly known as the gray-stemmed hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, hairy stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often tinged with a grayish hue. The plant produces clusters of small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed, with a distinctive, aromatic odor. This variant is closely related to other members of the Apiaceae family, sharing similar ecological and morphological traits."
