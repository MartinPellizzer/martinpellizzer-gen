    "intro": "Oenothera kernensis subsp. mojavensis, commonly known as the Mojave evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is adapted to extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
