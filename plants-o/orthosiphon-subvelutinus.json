    "intro": "Orthosiphon subvelutinus, commonly known as velvetleaf holy basil, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Orthosiphon subvelutinus thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas."
