    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a male bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
