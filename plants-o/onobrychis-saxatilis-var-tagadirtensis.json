    "intro": "Onobrychis saxatilis var. tagadirtensis, commonly known as the Tagadirt sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous and highland areas. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a valuable forage plant in dry environments. Its nitrogen-fixing ability also contributes to soil fertility in degraded lands."
