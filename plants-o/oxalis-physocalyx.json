    "intro": "Oxalis physocalyx, commonly known as the silverleaf wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Oxalis physocalyx is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
