    "intro": "Osmia phlogifolia, commonly known as the red-tailed miner bee, is a species of solitary bee native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red-tailed abdomen and slender body, which helps in distinguishing it from other bee species. This plant-pollinator relationship is crucial for the pollination of various flowering plants, including some wildflowers and fruit trees. Osmia phlogifolia typically nests in pre-existing cavities such as hollow stems or wooden logs. Its behavior and morphology make it an important contributor to biodiversity and ecosystem health."
