    "intro": "Oxytropis glutinosa, commonly known as sticky locoweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in dry grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. Oxytropis glutinosa is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
