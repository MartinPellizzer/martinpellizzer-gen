This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for both its fragrance and culinary uses. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with slender, upright stems and small, grass-like leaves. Its grains are typically shorter and more fragrant than those of common rice varieties. Due to its distinct characteristics, it is often used in traditional dishes and as a specialty ingredient in gourmet cooking."
