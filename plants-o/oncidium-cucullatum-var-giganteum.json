    "intro": "Oncidium cucullatum var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant hooded orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Central and South America. It features long, arching stems with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences with fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that have a distinctive hood-like lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
