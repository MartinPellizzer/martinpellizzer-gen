It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense, umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Oenanthe rigidius is characterized by its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
