    "intro": "Orobanche oxyloba f. septemloba, commonly known as the seven-lobed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced leaves and showy, often yellow or orange, flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is found in regions with suitable host species such as legumes. Its morphology includes a stem with several branches and small, scale-like leaves. The seven-lobed structure of its flowers is a distinguishing feature of this particular form."
