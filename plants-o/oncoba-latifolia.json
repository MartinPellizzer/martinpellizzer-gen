    "intro": "Oncoba latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf oncoba, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which are followed by fleshy, red berries containing seeds. Oncoba latifolia is often found in moist lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Its wood is lightweight and has been used in traditional crafts and construction."
