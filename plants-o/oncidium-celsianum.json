    "intro": "Oncidium celsianum, commonly known as the Celsian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium celsianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
