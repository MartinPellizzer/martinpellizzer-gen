    "intro": "Olearia lepidota, commonly known as the silver tree, is a shrub or small tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which results from the presence of fine, soft hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Olearia lepidota is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
