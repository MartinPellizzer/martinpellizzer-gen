    "intro": "Opuntia nigrispina, commonly known as the black-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads covered with sharp spines and glochids, which are tiny, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia nigrispina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
