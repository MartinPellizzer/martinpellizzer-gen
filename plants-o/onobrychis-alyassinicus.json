    "intro": "Onobrychis alyassinicus, commonly known as the Armenian clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It is often found in rocky or arid environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated for forage or ornamental purposes."
