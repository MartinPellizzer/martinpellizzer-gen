    "intro": "Ophrys sphaciotica, commonly known as the Spanish orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that play a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. Its flowers have a complex structure with a labellum that resembles a female bee, enticing male bees for pollination. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
