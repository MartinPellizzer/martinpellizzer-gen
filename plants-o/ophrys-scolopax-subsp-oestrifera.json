    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. oestrifera, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and striking, reddish-brown flowers that resemble a female bee, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees through a process called pseudocopulation. The species is noted for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions."
