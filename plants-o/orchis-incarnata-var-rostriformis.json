    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. rostriformis, commonly known as the rostriform lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, fragrant flower spike. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. This variety is known for its elongated, narrow flowers that give it a unique, almost beak-like appearance, hence its specific epithet \"rostriformis.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
