    "intro": "Ophiopogon erectus, commonly known as upright lilyturf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage that grows in clumps, with narrow, dark green leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements. Ophiopogon erectus is also valued for its ability to form dense ground cover, making it useful in landscaping and erosion control."
