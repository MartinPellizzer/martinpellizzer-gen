    "intro": "Orthopenthea telipogonis, commonly known as the white-flowered orthopenthea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic properties. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
