    "intro": "Onobrychis nummularia, commonly known as silver vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive silver-white underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Its root system is extensive and capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
