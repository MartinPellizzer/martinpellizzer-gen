    "intro": "Osteomeles schweriniae var. schweriniae, commonly known as the Schwerin's flame flower, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental bracts and adaptability to a range of growing conditions."
