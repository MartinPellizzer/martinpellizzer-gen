    "intro": "Onobrychis laxiflora, commonly known as the slender clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Onobrychis laxiflora is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment."
