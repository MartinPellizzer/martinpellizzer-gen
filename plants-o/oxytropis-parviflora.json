    "intro": "Oxytropis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow to pale green flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Oxytropis parviflora is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
