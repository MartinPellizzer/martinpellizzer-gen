    "intro": "Olyra latifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet-leafed olyra, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by elongated, woody pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests or along stream banks. Due to its hairy foliage and ecological role, it is of interest in botanical studies and traditional medicine."
