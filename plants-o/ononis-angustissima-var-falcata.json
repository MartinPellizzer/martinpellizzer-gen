    "intro": "Ononis angustissima var. falcata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, yellowish-white flowers bloom in spring, and the leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its sharply pointed leaf tips, which give it its specific epithet \"falcata.\""
