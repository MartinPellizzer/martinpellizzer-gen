    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant is characterized by its highly variable leaf shapes, which can range from elliptical to linear depending on the environmental conditions. It has small, white flowers that are clustered in spikes, and its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds into the water. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
