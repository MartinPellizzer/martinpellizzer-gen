    "intro": "Opuntia missouriensis var. albispina, commonly known as the Missouri prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the central United States. It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted for water storage. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, spherical fruits. Its spines are shorter and more whitish in color compared to other Opuntia species, giving it its specific variety name. This plant is well-suited to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
