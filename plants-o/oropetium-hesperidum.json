    "intro": "Oropetium hesperidum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Oropetium hesperidum is often used in traditional medicine and is adapted to thrive in extreme desert conditions."
