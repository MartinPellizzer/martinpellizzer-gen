    "intro": "Oxytropis incana, commonly known as the hoary locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and erect stems that often branch near the top. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis incana is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. It is considered a valuable forage plant for wildlife but can be toxic to livestock in certain conditions."
