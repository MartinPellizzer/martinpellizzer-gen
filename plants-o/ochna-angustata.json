It is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by distinctive, three-lobed, orange to red berries. Ochna angustata is adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in some indigenous communities."
