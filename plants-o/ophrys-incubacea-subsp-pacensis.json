    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea subsp. pacensis, commonly known as the Pacific bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This orchid is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific microhabitats with particular soil and moisture conditions."
