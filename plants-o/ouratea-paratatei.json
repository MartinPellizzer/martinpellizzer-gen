    "intro": "Ouratea paratatei, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value is mainly due to its attractive foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
