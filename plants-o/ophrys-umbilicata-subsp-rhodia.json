    "intro": "Ophrys umbilicata subsp. rhodia, commonly known as the Rhodian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive labellum that resembles a bee's body. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky outcrops and limestone slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
