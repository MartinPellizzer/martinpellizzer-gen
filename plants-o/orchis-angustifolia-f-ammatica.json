    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. ammatica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland habitats. Its growth is closely tied to specific ecological conditions, making it a sensitive indicator of environmental health. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
