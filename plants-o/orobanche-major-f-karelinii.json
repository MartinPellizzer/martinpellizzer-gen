    "intro": "Orobanche major f. karelinii, commonly known as the giant broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its absence of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. This species typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, often causing significant damage to agricultural crops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, dry fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it is considered a weed in many regions where it infests cultivated land."
