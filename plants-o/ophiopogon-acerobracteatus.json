    "intro": "Ophiopogon acerobracteatus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are usually white or pale purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
