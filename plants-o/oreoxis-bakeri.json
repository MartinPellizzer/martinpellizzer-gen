    "intro": "Oreoxis bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's oreoxis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Oreoxis bakeri thrives in well-drained soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
