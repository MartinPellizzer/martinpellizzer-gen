    "intro": "Otherodendron reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with a single trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white or yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in fleshy, orange-colored berries that are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in tropical botanical gardens."
