    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid variant with a spurred lip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spur at the base of the lip, which is a key feature in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected in conservation areas."
