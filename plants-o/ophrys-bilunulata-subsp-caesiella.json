    "intro": "Ophrys bilunulata subsp. caesiella, commonly known as the purple bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy by mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions for successful germination and growth. Its flowers are usually a mix of purple and white, with a distinctive lip that enhances its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
