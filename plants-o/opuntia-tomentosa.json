    "intro": "Opuntia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spiny stems, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. Opuntia tomentosa is also known for its role in traditional medicine and as a food source for various animals, including birds and insects."
