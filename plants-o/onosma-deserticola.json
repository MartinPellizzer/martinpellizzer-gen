    "intro": "Onosma deserticola, commonly known as the desert onosma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae, characterized by its hairy stems and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with small, succulent leaves that reduce water loss. It often grows in rocky soils and is well-suited to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Onosma deserticola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
