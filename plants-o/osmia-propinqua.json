    "intro": "Osmia propinqua, commonly known as the eastern squash bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee species native to North America. It is primarily associated with plants in the Cucurbitaceae family, such as squash and pumpkin, and plays a crucial role in their pollination. The female bee constructs its nest in the soil, lining the cells with a mixture of plant resins and secretions. Osmia propinqua is characterized by its dark, robust body and is often seen visiting flowers during the summer months. Its specialized morphology and foraging behavior make it an important pollinator for both wild and cultivated plants."
