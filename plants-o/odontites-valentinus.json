    "intro": "Odontites valentinus, commonly known as the Valentine's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a subtle fragrance, and it is known for its short blooming period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Odontites valentinus is considered a species of conservation concern."
