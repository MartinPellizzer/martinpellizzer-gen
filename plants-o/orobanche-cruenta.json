    "intro": "Orobanche cruenta, commonly known as the crimson broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, often growing in association with legumes and other flowering plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
