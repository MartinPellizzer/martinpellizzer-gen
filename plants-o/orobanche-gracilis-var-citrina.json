    "intro": "Orobanche gracilis var. citrina, commonly known as yellow dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically infests a variety of herbaceous plants, including legumes and grasses, in temperate regions. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
