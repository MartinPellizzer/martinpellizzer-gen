    "intro": "Orostachys, commonly known as the stonecrop or ice plant, is a genus of succulent plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia, particularly in China, Mongolia, and Siberia. Orostachys species are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink or red. They are often found growing on rocky soils and in mountainous areas, where they can withstand extreme temperatures and poor soil conditions. Due to their resilience and unique appearance, some species of Orostachys are cultivated as ornamental plants."
