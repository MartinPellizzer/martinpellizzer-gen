    "intro": "Oresitrophe rupifraga var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth rock-rose, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically hairy but become smooth as the plant matures, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
