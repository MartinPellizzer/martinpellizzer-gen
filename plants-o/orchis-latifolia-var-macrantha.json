    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. macrantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common among many orchid species. It is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, often forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
