It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces capsule fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis stenoptera is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
