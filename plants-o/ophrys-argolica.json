    "intro": "Ophrys argolica, commonly known as the Argolic bee orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which resembles a bee, aiding in its specialized pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow and brown, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a bee's body. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys argolica is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
