    "intro": "Oncidium macranthum, commonly known as the showy oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, long-lasting flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in nutrient-poor conditions. Oncidium macranthum is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
