    "intro": "Oeceoclades pusilla, commonly known as the miniature spider orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces tiny, delicate flowers in shades of white and green. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the rainy season. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
