It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are palmately compound, with several small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is an important part of the tundra ecosystem."
