It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its small white or yellowish flowers are followed by narrow, elongated fruits that give it its common name. Orthocarpus lasiorhynchus is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
