    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. biancae, commonly known as the Bianca's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
