    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera var. fissa, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a strikingly intricate flower that closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, greenish-yellow color with a prominent lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
