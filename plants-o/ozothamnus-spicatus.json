    "intro": "Ozothamnus spicatus, commonly known as the slender goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to golden flowers in dense spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ozothamnus spicatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
