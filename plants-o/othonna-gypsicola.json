    "intro": "Othonna gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum othonna, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and is often found in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. It has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils, particularly those containing gypsum. Othonna gypsicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
