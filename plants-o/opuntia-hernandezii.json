It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in clusters of spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring, followed by edible red fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Opuntia hernandezii is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food and fiber."
