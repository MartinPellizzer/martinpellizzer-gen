    "intro": "Oxytropis tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in racemose inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in arid and cold environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous regions."
