    "intro": "Orobanche racemosa, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish to reddish stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or purple in color. It is commonly found in grasslands and agricultural fields where it parasitizes a variety of host plants, including legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops and is considered a weed in many regions."
