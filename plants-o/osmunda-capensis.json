    "intro": "Osmunda capensis, commonly known as the southern royal fern, is a deciduous fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clusters. Osmunda capensis is often found near water bodies and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
