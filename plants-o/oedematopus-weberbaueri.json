    "intro": "Oedematopus weberbaueri, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and often covered in a fine, white coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Oedematopus weberbaueri thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
