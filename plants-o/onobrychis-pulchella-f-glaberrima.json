It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy in some varieties. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smooth, glabrous appearance."
