    "intro": "Oncidium alfredii, commonly known as the Alfred's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often short-lived but can last several weeks, and they are pollinated by various insects and birds. Oncidium alfredii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
