    "intro": "Oxytheca luteola, commonly known as the yellow oxytheca, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxytheca luteola is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
