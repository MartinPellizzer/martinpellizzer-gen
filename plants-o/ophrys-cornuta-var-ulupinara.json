    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. ulupinara, commonly known as the Ulupinar Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a complex, bee-mimicking labellum that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
