    "intro": "Oxydectes yunquensis, commonly known as the Yunquensis oxeye, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive central disc that adds to its ornamental appeal. Oxydectes yunquensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
