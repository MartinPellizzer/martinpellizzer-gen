    "intro": "Oakesia floridana, commonly known as the Florida oakesia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamp forests, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Oakesia floridana has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
