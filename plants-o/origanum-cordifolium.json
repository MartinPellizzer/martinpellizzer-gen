    "intro": "Origanum cordifolium, commonly known as heart-leaved oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or herb beds. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its use in culinary and medicinal applications."
