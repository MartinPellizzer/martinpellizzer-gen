    "intro": "Oxyrhynchus trinervius, commonly known as the three-veined oxyrhynchus, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and opposite, ovate leaves with three distinct veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
