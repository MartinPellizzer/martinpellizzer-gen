    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis andicola var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Andean woolly orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
