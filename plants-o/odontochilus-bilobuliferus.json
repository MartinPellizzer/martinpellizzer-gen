    "intro": "Odontochilus bilobuliferus, commonly known as the two-lobed toothed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive toothed lip, which gives it its scientific name, and its bilobed structure, which sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
