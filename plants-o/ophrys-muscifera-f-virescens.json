    "intro": "Ophrys muscifera f. virescens, commonly known as the green musk orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female insect to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and requires a specific microclimate to thrive. Its flowers are greenish in color, with a distinctive musk-like scent that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this orchid is considered vulnerable and is protected in several European countries."
