    "intro": "Ornithogalum excelsum, commonly known as the giant star of Bethlehem, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of star-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers. These flowers are typically arranged in umbels and bloom in late spring to early summer. Ornithogalum excelsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic appearance."
