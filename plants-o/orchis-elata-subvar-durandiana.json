    "intro": "Orchis elata subvar. durandiana, commonly known as the Alpine lady's tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear dense, dark green leaves. The plant produces a long, spiraled inflorescence of small, pale purple to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
