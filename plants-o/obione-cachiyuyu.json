It is a climbing vine that produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, emitting a strong fragrance. The plant is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment.

The plant is also valued for its ornamental beauty and has cultural significance among indigenous communities."
