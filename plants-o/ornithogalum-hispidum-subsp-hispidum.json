    "intro": "Ornithogalum hispidum subsp. hispidum, commonly known as the hairy star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces umbels of white or pale yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
