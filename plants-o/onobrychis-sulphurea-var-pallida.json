    "intro": "Onobrychis sulphurea var. pallida, commonly known as the pale sulphur everlasting, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its long-lasting, sulphur-yellow blooms that retain their color when dried."
