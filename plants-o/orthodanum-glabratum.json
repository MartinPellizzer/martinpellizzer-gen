    "intro": "Orthodanum glabratum, commonly known as the smooth orthodanum, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
