    "intro": "Ophrys montis-gargani, commonly known as the Gargano Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Gargano region of southern Italy. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single, showy flower. The flower has a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
