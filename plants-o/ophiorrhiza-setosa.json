    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza setosa, commonly known as the hairy mangrove or bristly mangrove, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. This plant is typically found in coastal areas, thriving in saline and waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are followed by small, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. Ophiorrhiza setosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting coastal biodiversity."
