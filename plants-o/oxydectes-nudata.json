    "intro": "Oxydectes nudata, commonly known as the naked stem dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairless stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Oxydectes nudata is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
