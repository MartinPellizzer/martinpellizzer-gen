    "intro": "Oberonia nitidicauda, commonly known as the shining-tailed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces intricate inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with reddish or brownish markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
