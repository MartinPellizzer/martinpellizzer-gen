It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
