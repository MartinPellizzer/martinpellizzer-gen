    "intro": "Onopordum cynarocephalum, commonly known as the thistle of the Mediterranean, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a robust stem covered in spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both a resilient wild plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
