    "intro": "Ornithocephalus bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned orchid, is a striking orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring two prominent, horn-like projections on the labellum, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
