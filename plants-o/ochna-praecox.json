    "intro": "Ochna praecox, commonly known as the early ochna, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Ochna praecox thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
