    "intro": "Oncidium beyrodtioides, commonly known as the Bicolor Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of three to five, with a distinctive color contrast between the upper and lower petals. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, producing new shoots from the base of the previous growth. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
