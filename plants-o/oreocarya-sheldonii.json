    "intro": "Oreocarya sheldonii, commonly known as Sheldon's oreocarya, is a rare shrub native to the high-elevation regions of the Great Basin in Nevada. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is adapted to arid conditions and can survive in extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
