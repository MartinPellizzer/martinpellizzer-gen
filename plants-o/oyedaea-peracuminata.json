    "intro": "Oyedaea peracuminata, commonly known as the sour fig, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are typically sour in taste. The fruit is encased in a thick, fleshy pulp that contains numerous seeds. Oyedaea peracuminata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its use in traditional medicine."
