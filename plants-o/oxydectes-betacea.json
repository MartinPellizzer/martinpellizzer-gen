    "intro": "Oxydectes betacea, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, flowering stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Oxydectes betacea plays an important role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
