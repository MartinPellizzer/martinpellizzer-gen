    "intro": "Oenothera biennis var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf evening primrose, is a variant of the evening primrose native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, typically growing to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. The silverleaf evening primrose is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
