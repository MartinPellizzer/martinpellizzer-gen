    "intro": "Oreogrammitis pseudoxiphopteris, commonly known as the false sword fern, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, water-repellent scales. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where high humidity supports its growth."
