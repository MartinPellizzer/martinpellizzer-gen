It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are linear and grass-like. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in high-altitude conditions with low temperatures and strong winds. Odontarrhena alpestris is also known for its use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
