    "intro": "Orchis sancta, commonly known as the holy orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in woodland or grassland habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Orchis sancta has a complex root system and produces a single, showy flower per stem. Due to its historical association with religious sites, it has also been called the \"holy orchid\" in some regions."
