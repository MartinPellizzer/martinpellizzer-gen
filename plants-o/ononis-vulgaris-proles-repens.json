    "intro": "Ononis vulgaris proles repens, commonly known as creeping whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste ground."
