    "intro": "Oenothera macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, winged seeds. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Oenothera macrosperma is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
