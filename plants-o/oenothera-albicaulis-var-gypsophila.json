    "intro": "Oenothera albicaulis var. gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is part of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators like moths and bats."
