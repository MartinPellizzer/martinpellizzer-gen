    "intro": "Onuris, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant belonging to the Nelumbonaceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that open in the early morning and close at sunset. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor in the mud below. Onuris is native to parts of Asia, particularly India and China, and has been revered in various cultures for its symbolic and spiritual significance. Its ability to thrive in still water makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
