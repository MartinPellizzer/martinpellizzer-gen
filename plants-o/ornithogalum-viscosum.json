    "intro": "Ornithogalum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky owl's-milk, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of white or pale green flowers with six petals, which bloom in spring. Its underground bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The sticky sap has historically been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
