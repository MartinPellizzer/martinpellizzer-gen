    "intro": "Orthandra schweinfurthii, commonly known as the Schweinfurth's orthandra, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
