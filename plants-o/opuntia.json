    "intro": "Opuntia, commonly known as prickly pear, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their flat, fleshy stems, which are often covered in spines and sometimes adorned with colorful flowers. Opuntia species are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, succulent tissues. They produce edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients. The plant's unique structure and resilience make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation."
