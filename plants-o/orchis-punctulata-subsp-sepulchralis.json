    "intro": "Orchis punctulata subsp. sepulchralis, commonly known as the sepulchral orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers with a prominent yellow lip, which are typically arranged in a loose spike. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in forested areas with moist, calcareous soils. Its habitat is often shaded and humid, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
