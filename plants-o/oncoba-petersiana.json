It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense inflorescences, which are followed by small, round fruits.

Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
