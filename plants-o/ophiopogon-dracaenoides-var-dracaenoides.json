    "intro": "Ophiopogon dracaenoides var. dracaenoides, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a dense, low-growing clump. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring or early summer, followed by red berries that are ornamental but toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
