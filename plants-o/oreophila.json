    "intro": "Oreophila, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its bell-shaped or tubular flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. These plants are native to mountainous regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, where they thrive in rocky or alpine environments. Oreophila species often have hairy leaves and stems, which help them withstand cold and windy conditions. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental beauty and ability to bloom in challenging climates."
