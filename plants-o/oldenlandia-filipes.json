    "intro": "Oldenlandia filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia, often growing on the branches of host trees. The plant has small, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in umbels. It produces small, round berries that are dispersed by birds and other animals. Its botanical structure reflects its parasitic lifestyle, with reduced roots and specialized structures for attaching to host plants."
