    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. medea, commonly known as the Mediterranean bee orchid, is a species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. This orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, making it a fascinating subject in the study of plant-animal interactions."
