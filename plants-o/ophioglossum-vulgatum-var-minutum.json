    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. minutum, commonly known as the little adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species with unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and a distinctive, tongue-like spore-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a primitive morphology, with a short, creeping rhizome and two types of leaves: a sterile, elongated leaf and a spore-producing, shorter leaf. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
