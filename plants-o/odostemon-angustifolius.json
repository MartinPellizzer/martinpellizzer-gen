    "intro": "Odostemon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly bitter taste, while the flowers attract various pollinators. Odostemon angustifolius is also used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
