It is characterized by its spiny, segmented stems and produces large, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers have a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
