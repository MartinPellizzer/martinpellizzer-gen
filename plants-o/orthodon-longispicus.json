    "intro": "Orthodon longispicus, commonly known as the long-spined orthodon, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its unique spines, which are elongated and rigid, serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Orthodon longispicus is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
