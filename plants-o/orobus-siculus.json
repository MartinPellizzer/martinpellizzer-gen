    "intro": "Orobus siculus, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
