    "intro": "Ophioglossum gracillimum, commonly known as the slender adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, tongue-like spore-producing structure called a sporophyll, which is typically narrow and elongated. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, broad, leathery leaf that is often divided into two lobes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
