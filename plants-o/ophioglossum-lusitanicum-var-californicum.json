    "intro": "Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. californicum, commonly known as the California adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to California. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing structure called a sporophyll, which is positioned at the base of the leaf. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with separate male and female spore-producing structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
