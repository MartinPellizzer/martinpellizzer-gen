    "intro": "Ophrys latilabris, commonly known as the broad-lipped bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are designed to attract male bees through mimicry, facilitating pollination. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
