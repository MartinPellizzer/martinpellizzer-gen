    "intro": "Olmedia asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf olmedia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Olmedia asperula is often used in ornamental gardening for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
