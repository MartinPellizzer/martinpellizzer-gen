    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza pectinata, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous minute seeds. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Ophiorrhiza pectinata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
