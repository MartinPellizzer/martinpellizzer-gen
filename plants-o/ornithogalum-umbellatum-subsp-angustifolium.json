    "intro": "Ornithogalum umbellatum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a tall, leafless stem bearing a dense umbel of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and has a corm-like underground storage organ. It is often found in grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
