    "intro": "Otidia, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, dandelion-like flowers that typically have yellow petals and a composite structure. Otidia species are native to various regions in the Americas and are often found in open, disturbed habitats. They produce seeds that are dispersed by wind, similar to true dandelions. The leaves are usually alternate, lance-shaped, and have a rough or hairy texture."
