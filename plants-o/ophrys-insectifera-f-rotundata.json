    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera f. rotundata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. This particular form is distinguished by its rounded, bee-like flowers that mimic the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with dark markings, and they emit a scent that mimics the pheromones of bees. The species is notable for its specialized relationship with certain bee pollinators, making it an important subject in studies of mimicry and plant-pollinator interactions."
