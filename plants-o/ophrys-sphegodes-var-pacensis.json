    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes var. pacensis, commonly known as the Pacific bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to western North America. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth, dark green surface. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are a striking combination of yellow, brown, and black, creating a highly specialized mimicry for pollination."
