    "intro": "Orchis amoena, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish with a distinctive, spurred lip. Orchis amoena thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows."
