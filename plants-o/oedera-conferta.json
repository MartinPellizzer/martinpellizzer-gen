    "intro": "Oedera conferta, commonly known as the broadleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing the seeds. Oedera conferta is typically found in humid, lowland forests and thrives in areas with high rainfall. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
