    "intro": "Ochetophila trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with three primary veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds."
