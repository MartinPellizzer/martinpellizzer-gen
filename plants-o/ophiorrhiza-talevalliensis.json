It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. It has a unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with certain fungi, aiding in nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
