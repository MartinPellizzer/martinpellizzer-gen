    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza japonica var. minor, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by water. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in mangrove swamps and tidal mudflats. Its unique adaptations to coastal conditions make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
