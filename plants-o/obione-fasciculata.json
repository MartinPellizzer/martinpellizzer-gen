    "intro": "Obione fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive structure with leafy shoots that are arranged in dense clusters, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Obione fasciculata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
