    "intro": "Oxydectes subpannosa var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
