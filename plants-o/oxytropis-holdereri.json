    "intro": "Oxytropis holdereri, commonly known as the Tibetan locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
