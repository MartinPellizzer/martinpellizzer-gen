    "intro": "Ornduffia, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ornduffia thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in landscaped areas."
