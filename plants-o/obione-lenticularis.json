    "intro": "Obione lenticularis, commonly known as the lens-shaped lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique lenticular or lens-like shape. It is characterized by its flat, disc-shaped thallus that is typically light to dark brown in color. This lichen thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on decaying wood or stone surfaces. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions in its habitat."
