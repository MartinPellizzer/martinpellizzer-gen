    "intro": "Oxytropis falcata var. maquensis, commonly known as Maqu's sickle vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne in dense, sparsely branched inflorescences. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, demonstrating adaptability to high-altitude conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
