    "intro": "Odontosoria tsoongii, commonly known as the Tsoong's tooth fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tooth-like lobes on the fronds, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a membranous indusium. Odontosoria tsoongii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
