    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. pollinensis, commonly known as the Pollinens Ophrys, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. This species is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a key adaptation for its unique pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a greenish-yellow corolla and a prominent, hairy lip that plays a crucial role in attracting male bees for pseudocopulation. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils at high altitudes, often in open habitats with limited vegetation. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragmentation, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
