    "intro": "Oberonia variabilis var. trilobulata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, branching stem with numerous small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive three-lobed petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
