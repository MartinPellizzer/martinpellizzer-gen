    "intro": "Odontotrichum rumicifolium, commonly known as the woolly chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, white trichomes, giving it a woolly appearance. Odontotrichum rumicifolium is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
