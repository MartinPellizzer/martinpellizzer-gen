    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 buelii, commonly known as the Buel's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis moria and Orchis mascula. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a rosette of linear leaves and a single, erect flowering stem. The flowers are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that is often marked with darker veins. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This species is notable for its role in pollination by bees and its ecological significance in its native range."
