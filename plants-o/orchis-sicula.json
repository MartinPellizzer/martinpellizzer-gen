It is a perennial herb with a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces a single, showy spike of flowers, typically in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Orchis sicula is known for its ornamental value and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
