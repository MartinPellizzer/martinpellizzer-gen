    "intro": "Octarrhena cylindrica var. major, commonly known as the tall date palm, is a perennial shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It features a slender, unbranched stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that resemble dates. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential agricultural use in suitable climates."
