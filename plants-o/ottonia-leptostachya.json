    "intro": "Ottonia leptostachya, commonly known as the slender-stalked ottonia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features a robust rhizome system that helps it thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a waxy surface. Ottonia leptostachya is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
