It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, violet-purple flowers with distinctive dark spots. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal.
