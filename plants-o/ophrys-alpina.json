    "intro": "Ophrys alpina, commonly known as the Alpine bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Ophrys alpina is valued for its ecological role and is often found in conservation areas due to its limited distribution."
