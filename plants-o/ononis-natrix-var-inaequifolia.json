    "intro": "Ononis natrix var. inaequifolia, commonly known as the unequal-leaved sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically linear to ovate, with varying lengths along the stem, giving it the \"unequal-leaved\" designation. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes or limestone habitats."
