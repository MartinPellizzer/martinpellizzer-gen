    "intro": "Orobanche rapum-genistae var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteate yellow broom broom. This parasitic plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of leguminous plants. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its structure is adapted for efficient parasitic attachment. The species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical study is important for understanding parasitic plant-host interactions in agricultural ecosystems."
