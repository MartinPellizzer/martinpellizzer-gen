It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Osbeckia saddlepeakensis is considered a rare and endemic species, reflecting the unique biodiversity of Hawaii's flora. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and invasive species."
