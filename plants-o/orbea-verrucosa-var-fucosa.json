    "intro": "Orbea verrucosa var. fucosa, commonly known as the woolly orbea, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rockeries and dry landscape designs."
