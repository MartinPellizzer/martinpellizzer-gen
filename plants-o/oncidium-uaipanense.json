    "intro": "Oncidium uaipanense, commonly known as the Uaipanense orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the production of pseudobulbs. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Oncidium uaipanense is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture but remains relatively rare in the wild."
