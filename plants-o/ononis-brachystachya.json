    "intro": "Ononis brachystachya, commonly known as dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deep within the soil. Ononis brachystachya is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
