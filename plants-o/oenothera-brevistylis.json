    "intro": "Oenothera brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled evening primrose, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and has hairy stems and leaves. Its flowers have both male and female parts, making it a perfect flower, and it relies on nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
