    "intro": "Ornithogalum saxatile, commonly known as the rock onion or saxatile star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Ornithogalum saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
