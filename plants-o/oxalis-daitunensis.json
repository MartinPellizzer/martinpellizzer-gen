    "intro": "Oxalis daitunensis, commonly known as the Daitun wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to China and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oxalis daitunensis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and seasonal blooming habit."
