    "intro": "Oenothera sinuata var. humifusa, commonly known as the creeping evening primrose, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive sinuate margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is adapted to moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sun."
