    "intro": "Olbia heterophylla, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Olbia heterophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
