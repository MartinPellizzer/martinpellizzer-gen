    "intro": "Oxymeris alpestris, commonly known as the alpine oxymeris, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are generally small, leathery, and adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. Oxymeris alpestris is valued for its hardiness and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal in cooler climates."
