    "intro": "Oncidium harrisonianum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps store water. The species is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
