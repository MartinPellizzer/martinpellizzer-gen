    "intro": "Opuntia echinacea, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in sharp spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, called a tun, is edible and contains small, sweet seeds. Opuntia echinacea is also known for its ability to store water, making it highly adapted to arid environments."
