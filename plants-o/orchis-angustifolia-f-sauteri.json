    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. sauteri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks, where it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its small size and inconspicuous appearance make it challenging to identify without close examination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
