    "intro": "Osmunda \u00d7 bipinnata, commonly known as the interrupted fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Osmunda regalis and Osmunda claytonii. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are divided into two sets of pinnae, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Its rhizomes are thick and segmented, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically green with a smooth, waxy surface, and they turn a reddish-brown color before falling in the fall."
