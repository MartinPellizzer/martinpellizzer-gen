    "intro": "Oxytropis oedistyla, commonly known as the narrowleaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open plains. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
