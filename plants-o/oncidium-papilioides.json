    "intro": "Oncidium papilioides, commonly known as the Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features striking, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with contrasting markings. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees or other structures without soil. Oncidium papilioides is prized for its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
