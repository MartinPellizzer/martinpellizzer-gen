    "intro": "Oxalis rosea, commonly known as the coral bells, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle coral tint. The plant has trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens. Oxalis rosea is also valued for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover in suitable conditions."
