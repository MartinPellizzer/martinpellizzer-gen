    "intro": "Omphalodes luciliae subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and limestone outcrops. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
