    "intro": "Outea acaciifolia, commonly known as the acacia-leaf oaks, is a deciduous tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of acacia species. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Outea acaciifolia is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
