It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces numerous small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to other forms of Orchis latifolia."
