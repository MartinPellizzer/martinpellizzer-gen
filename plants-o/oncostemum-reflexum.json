    "intro": "Oncostemum reflexum, commonly known as the curly willow or zigzag willow, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, arching branches that often curve and twist, giving it a distinctive, weeping appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by fluffy, pale brown seed heads. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Oncostemum reflexum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
