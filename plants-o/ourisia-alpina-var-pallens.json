    "intro": "Ourisia alpina var. pallens, commonly known as the pale alpine ourisia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pale yellow to white, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrowly elliptic and covered with a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This variant is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the typical form of Ourisia alpina."
