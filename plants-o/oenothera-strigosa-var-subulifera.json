    "intro": "Oenothera strigosa var. subulifera, commonly known as the slender-leaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variant is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its potential medicinal uses."
