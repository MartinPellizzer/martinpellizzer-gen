    "intro": "Origanum vulgare, commonly known as oregano, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, tubular flowers and hairy, woody stems. The plant produces tiny, dark blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad, oval, and have a strong, pungent aroma due to high concentrations of essential oils. Oregano thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for Mediterranean gardens and culinary use."
