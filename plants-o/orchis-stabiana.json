    "intro": "Orchis stabiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender stem that bears a single, showy orchid-like flower with a distinctive violet or purple hue. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette. The orchid has a complex floral structure with specialized petals and sepals that play a role in pollination by insects."
