    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum subsp. lusitanicum, commonly known as the Portuguese adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique, lance-shaped leaves that are often green with a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium, which are arranged in a row along the underside of the fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
