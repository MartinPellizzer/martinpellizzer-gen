    "intro": "Oestlundorchis pseudopyramidalis, commonly known as the false pyramid orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, grass-like appearance with narrow, dark green leaves and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
