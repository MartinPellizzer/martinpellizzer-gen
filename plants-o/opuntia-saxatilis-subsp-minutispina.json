    "intro": "Opuntia saxatilis subsp. minutispina, commonly known as the small-spined rock cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub-like cactus characterized by its flattened, ribbed stems and small, spiny cladodes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Its adaptations include reduced leaf surface and thick, water-storing stems, making it well-suited for desert conditions."
