    "intro": "Oxytropis pusilla, commonly known as dwarf locoweed, is a small, herbaceous annual plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with small, narrow leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its small size and ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
