    "intro": "Olmediella ilicifolia, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in dry environments. Olmediella ilicifolia plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
