    "intro": "Oxalis pseudotetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf oxalis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Oxalidaceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate or four-leaf clover-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis pseudotetraphylla is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established."
