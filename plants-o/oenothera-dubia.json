    "intro": "Oenothera dubia, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oenothera dubia is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or dry areas."
