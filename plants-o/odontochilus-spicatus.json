    "intro": "Odontochilus spicatus, commonly known as the spicate toothed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive toothed lip, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in a raceme. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in horticulture."
