    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. This plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its growth is slow, and it requires careful conservation due to habitat loss and environmental changes. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
