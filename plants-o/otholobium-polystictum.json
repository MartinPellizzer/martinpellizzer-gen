    "intro": "Otholobium polystictum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr medic, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, followed by woody, spiny pods that contain small, round seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Otholobium polystictum is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
