    "intro": "Odontites luteus subsp. lanceolatus, commonly known as the yellow toothplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface and a yellowish-green hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a loose panicle during the spring season. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many parts of its range."
