It is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy leaves that are a vibrant green, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for Mediterranean gardens. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, contribute to its strong fragrance and medicinal properties."
