    "intro": "Orchis wardii, commonly known as the Ward's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a tall stem with showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in specific ecological niches. The orchid is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake."
