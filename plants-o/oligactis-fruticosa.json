    "intro": "Oligactis fruticosa, commonly known as the coastal shrub or beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Oligactis fruticosa plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
