    "intro": "Opuntia steiniana, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless stems that are often ribbed and covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, making it a nocturnal bloomer. Its fruit, which is typically red or yellow, contains small, edible seeds. Opuntia steiniana is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and reducing water loss through its waxy coating."
