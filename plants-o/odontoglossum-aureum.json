    "intro": "Odontoglossum aureum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its high-altitude, cool climate. Its leaves are sword-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Odontoglossum aureum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking floral display."
