It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear clusters of bright yellow, fragrant flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Oncidium exalatum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
