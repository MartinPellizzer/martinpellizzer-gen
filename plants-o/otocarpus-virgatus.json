    "intro": "Otocarpus virgatus, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palm-like leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often growing near the shoreline. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Otocarpus virgatus plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
