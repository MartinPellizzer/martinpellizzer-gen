It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its roots are tuberous, and it produces a single, showy flower per stem.
