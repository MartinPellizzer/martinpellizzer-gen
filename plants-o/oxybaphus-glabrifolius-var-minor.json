    "intro": "Oxybaphus glabrifolius var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oxybaphus, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal form, minor, distinguishes itself from the typical species through its reduced leaf size and more compact structure."
