    "intro": "Oberonia muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
