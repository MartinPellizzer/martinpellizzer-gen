It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to tolerate dry conditions makes it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions."
