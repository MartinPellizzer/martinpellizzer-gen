    "intro": "Orobanche balsensis, commonly known as the Balsam Orlean or the Balsam broom, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions of Europe and the Middle East. The plant produces small, reddish or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. Its life cycle involves germinating in the soil and then attaching to the roots of a host plant, such as legumes or other flowering plants. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken or even kill its host, making it both a botanical curiosity and an agricultural concern."
