    "intro": "Orobanche fraasii, commonly known as the Fras's broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is native to regions of southern Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
