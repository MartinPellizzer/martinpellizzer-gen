    "intro": "Ophrys nestoris, commonly known as the Nestor's bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 cm, with a single, erect stem bearing a single flower. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette at the base. The orchid thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
