    "intro": "Oemleria, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plants are typically evergreen shrubs or small trees, characterized by their bell-shaped, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. Oemleria species often have dark green, leathery leaves and produce small, dark berries in the fall. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display."
