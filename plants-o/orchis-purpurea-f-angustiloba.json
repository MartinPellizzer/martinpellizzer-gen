It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodland edges and meadows. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
