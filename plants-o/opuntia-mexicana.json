    "intro": "Opuntia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into photosynthetic stems, and it has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia mexicana is also known for its ability to store water, making it highly adapted to desert conditions."
