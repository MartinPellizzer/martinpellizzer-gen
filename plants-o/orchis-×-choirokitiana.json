    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 choirokitiana, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The hybrid is notable for its genetic diversity and is often found in regions where the parent species co-occur."
