    "intro": "Olax scandens, commonly known as the climbing olax, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features opposite, simple, and often ovate or elliptic leaves that are usually green on the upper surface and paler underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white or yellowish flowers, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Its climbing habit is facilitated by tendrils that emerge from the leaf axils. Olax scandens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
