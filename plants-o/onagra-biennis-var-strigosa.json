    "intro": "Onagra biennis var. strigosa, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a biennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the second year of its life cycle. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves helps reduce water loss, making it well-adapted to dry conditions."
