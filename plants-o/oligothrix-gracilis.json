    "intro": "Oligothrix gracilis, commonly known as the slender filamentous green alga, is a freshwater species belonging to the family Oligothrichaceae. It is characterized by its thin, unbranched filaments composed of elongated cells that are typically 5\u201310 micrometers in diameter. This alga thrives in nutrient-rich aquatic environments, often forming dense mats on the surfaces of lakes and ponds. Its cellular structure allows for efficient photosynthesis, contributing to oxygen production in water ecosystems. Oligothrix gracilis plays a minor but ecologically significant role in aquatic food webs as a primary producer."
