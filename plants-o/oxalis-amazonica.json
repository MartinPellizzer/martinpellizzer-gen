    "intro": "Oxalis amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and small, delicate yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its stems are usually woody, and it produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Oxalis amazonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
