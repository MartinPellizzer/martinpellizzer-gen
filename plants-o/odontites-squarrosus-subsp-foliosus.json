    "intro": "Odontites squarrosus subsp. foliosus, commonly known as the woolly rock-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white to grey pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
