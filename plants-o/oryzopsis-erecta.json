It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and grasslands, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers.
