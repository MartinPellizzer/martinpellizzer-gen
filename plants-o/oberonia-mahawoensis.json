    "intro": "Oberonia mahawoensis, commonly known as the Mahawo orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth of dense forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Oberonia mahawoensis is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
