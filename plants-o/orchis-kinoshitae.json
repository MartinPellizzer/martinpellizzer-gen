    "intro": "Orchis kinoshitae, commonly known as the Japanese twayblade, is a rare and endangered orchid native to Japan. It is a herbaceous plant with a slender, upright stem that bears a single pair of opposite leaves. The flower spike is short, typically less than 10 cm, and produces two small, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes."
