    "intro": "Oberonia glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry stem with several fleshy, elongated leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded forest environments. Oberonia glandulifera is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
