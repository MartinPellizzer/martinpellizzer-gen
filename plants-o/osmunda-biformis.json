    "intro": "Osmunda biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that are divided into two distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are typically green and can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it float. Osmunda biformis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
