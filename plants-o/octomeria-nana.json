    "intro": "Octomeria nana, commonly known as the dwarf octomeria, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Octomeria nana thrives in well-drained sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
