    "intro": "Olbia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved olbia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features basal leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Olbia obtusa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
