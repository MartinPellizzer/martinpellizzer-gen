    "intro": "Otanthera crinita, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, white to pale purple flower spikes in late summer. The plant thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. It is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Otanthera crinita is also an important food source for various pollinators and wildlife."
