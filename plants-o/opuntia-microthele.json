    "intro": "Opuntia microthele, commonly known as the dwarf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its small, flattened stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by bright red fruits that are edible. Opuntia microthele thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and well-drained soil. Its unique structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
