    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza shiqianensis, commonly known as the Shiqian endemic mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while it produces its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. It is typically found in humid, shaded forest environments, often growing on the branches of other plants. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
