    "intro": "Oraoma canarana, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the damp soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
