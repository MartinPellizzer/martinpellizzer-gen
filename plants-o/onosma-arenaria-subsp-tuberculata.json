    "intro": "Onosma arenaria subsp. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often covered in small, rounded tubercles. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
