    "intro": "Oberonia serrulata, commonly known as the serrated orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Oberonia serrulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
