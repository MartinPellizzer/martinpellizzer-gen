    "intro": "Oberonia latipetala, commonly known as the broad-petaled orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that help store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with broad petals and a distinctive, often fragrant, labellum. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated by enthusiasts but is also threatened by habitat loss in the wild."
