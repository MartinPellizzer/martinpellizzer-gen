    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea subsp. ionica, commonly known as the Ionian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking floral morphology, with a flower that closely resembles a female bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
