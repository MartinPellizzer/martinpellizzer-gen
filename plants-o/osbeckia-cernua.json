    "intro": "Osbeckia cernua, commonly known as the creeping willow or groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Osbeckia cernua thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks."
