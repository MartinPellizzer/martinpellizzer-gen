It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Ottonia maguirei has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
