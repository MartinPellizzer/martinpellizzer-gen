    "intro": "Ochrosperma sulcatum, commonly known as the smooth-ribbed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark green to blackish upper surface and a lighter, often whitish lower surface. The thallus is typically leathery and flat, with distinct, parallel-veined lobes. It forms symbiotic relationships with cyanobacteria, which contribute to its nitrogen fixation capabilities. This lichen is often found on bark, soil, and rocks in temperate regions."
