    "intro": "Obione pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's obione, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding structure, typical of bromeliads. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of red or orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Obione pringlei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
