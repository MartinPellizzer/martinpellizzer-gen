    "intro": "Oenothera rosea var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved evening primrose, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that typically grow to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is characterized by its smaller leaves compared to the typical Oenothera rosea, giving it a distinct appearance."
