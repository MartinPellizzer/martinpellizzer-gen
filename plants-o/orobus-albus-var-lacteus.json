    "intro": "Orobus albus var. lacteus, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive corolla that curves inward. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. This plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
