    "intro": "Oreopanax microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed mountain aralia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound, pinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, followed by berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
