    "intro": "Oberonia rubra, commonly known as the red orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a velvety texture. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Oberonia rubra is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
