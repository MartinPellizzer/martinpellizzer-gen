    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii f. spissa, commonly known as the Spiny Dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange, thread-like stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically infests leguminous hosts such as vetch and clover, weakening them by drawing water and nutrients. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of agricultural crops."
