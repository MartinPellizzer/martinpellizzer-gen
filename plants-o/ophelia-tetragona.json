It is a member of the Pontederiaceae family and is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, four-angled, and usually submerged. Its small, blue or violet flowers bloom in clusters at the water surface, attracting various pollinators.
