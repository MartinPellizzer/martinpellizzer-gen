It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, rounded leaves that are often mistaken for wool, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
