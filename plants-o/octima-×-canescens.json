    "intro": "Octima \u00d7 canescens, commonly known as the hybrid cottonwood, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is a natural hybrid between Populus deltoides and Populus balsamifera, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The tree typically grows in riparian zones, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
