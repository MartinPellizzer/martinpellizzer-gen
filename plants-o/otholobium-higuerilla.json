It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often used in reclamation projects. The seed pods are woody and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals."
