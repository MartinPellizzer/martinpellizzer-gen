    "intro": "Orchis sambucina subvar. purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wet meadows and marshy areas in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to violet flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring lance-shaped leaves and a single, racemose inflorescence. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip, and the plant relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Orchis sambucina subvar. purpurea is an indicator species for nutrient-poor, calcareous habitats."
