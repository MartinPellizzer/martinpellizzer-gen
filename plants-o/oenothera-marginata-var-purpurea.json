It is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple, typically opening in the evening. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a silvery underside, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant scent at night to attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is known for its ability to self-seed and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
