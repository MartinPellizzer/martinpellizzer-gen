    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. oblita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and stream sides. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a dark green coloration. The subspecies oblita is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the Ophrys genus."
