    "intro": "Oxydectes ypanemensis, commonly known as the Ypanemenses orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
