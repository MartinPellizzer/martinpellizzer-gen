    "intro": "Ophrys lutea subsp. aspea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its flowers are yellow with intricate patterns and a unique lip that plays a key role in the pollination process. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
