    "intro": "Onopordum illiricum, commonly known as the Croatian thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, purple or pinkish-red flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
