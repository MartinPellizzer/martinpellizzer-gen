    "intro": "Ouratea oblanceolata, commonly known as the Brazilian beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by violet to purple berries in late summer. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
