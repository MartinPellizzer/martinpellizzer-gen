    "intro": "Orobus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have smooth, often hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually simple and divided. Their flowers are usually greenish or yellowish, with five to eight sepals and no petals, and they bloom in early spring. Orobus species are often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
