    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. collina, commonly known as the mountain rice, is a wild rice species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and grows in wetland or marshy environments. This variety is typically shorter and more compact compared to its domesticated counterpart, Oryza sativa. It has small, elliptical grains that are usually white or pale yellow in color. The plant is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability to various ecological conditions."
