    "intro": "Oxydectes pomaderris, commonly known as the pink mallee, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, rough, and often fissured bark. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by small, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Oxydectes pomaderris is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry conditions."
