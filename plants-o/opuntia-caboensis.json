    "intro": "Opuntia caboensis, commonly known as the Cape Hare\u2019s foot, is a species of cactus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Opuntia caboensis is adapted to arid environments and can thrive in well-drained soils. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in the region."
