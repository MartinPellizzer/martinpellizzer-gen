    "intro": "Orchipedum wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, showy blooms that typically feature a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or forested substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchipedum wenzelii is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
