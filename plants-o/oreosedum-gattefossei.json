It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
