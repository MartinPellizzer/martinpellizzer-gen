It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and dry slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oenothera nealleyi is part of the Onagraceae family and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators like moths and beetles."
