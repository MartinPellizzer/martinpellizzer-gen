    "intro": "Oxytropis ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajan locoweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, often spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and possesses deep root systems to access water. It is known for its toxic alkaloids, which can affect livestock and are responsible for the condition known as locoweed poisoning. Oxytropis ajanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes but is also considered a noxious weed in some areas."
