    "intro": "Oreobolus obtusangulus, commonly known as the blunt-angled sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a small, mat-forming perennial grass that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oreobolus obtusangulus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is part of the Poaceae family."
