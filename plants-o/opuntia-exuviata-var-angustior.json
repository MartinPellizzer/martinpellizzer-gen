    "intro": "Opuntia exuviata var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spineless pads and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a succulent stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces edible fruits known as tunas. The species is well adapted to desert conditions, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in poor soil."
