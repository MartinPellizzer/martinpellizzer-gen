    "intro": "Ornithopteris caudata, commonly known as the feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain species. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Ornithopteris caudata is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage."
