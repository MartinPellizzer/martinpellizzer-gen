    "intro": "Omphalandria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its unique structure and habitat requirements make it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Omphalandria is listed as an endangered species."
