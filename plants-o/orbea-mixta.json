    "intro": "Orbea mixta, commonly known as the Cape bell, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically small and thick, adapted to reduce water loss. Orbea mixta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
