It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small, fragrant flowers arranged in a dense spike. The leaves are broad and grass-like, often covered in a fine pubescence that helps retain moisture."
