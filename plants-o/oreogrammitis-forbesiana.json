    "intro": "Oreogrammitis forbesiana, commonly known as the Forbes' rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 inches long. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Oreogrammitis forbesiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
