    "intro": "Ophrys obaesa, commonly known as the Obaesa bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral structure, which features a single, downward-facing flower with a distinctive yellow and brown coloration. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Ophrys obaesa is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, mimicking the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. It is a rare and protected species, often found in specific habitats with limited distribution."
