    "intro": "Opuntia megapotamica var. salagria, commonly known as the Salagria prickly pear, is a cacti species native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It features flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and woolly areoles, typical of the Opuntia genus. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in local communities."
