    "intro": "Otholobium accrescens, commonly known as the increasing otholobium, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a small, erect shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plant features small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, and it produces small, rounded pods containing several seeds. Otholobium accrescens is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
