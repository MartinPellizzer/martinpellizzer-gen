    "intro": "Oxytropis macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaved locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis macroptera is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife, though it can be toxic to livestock in large quantities."
