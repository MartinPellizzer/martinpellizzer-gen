    "intro": "Opuntia pascoensis, commonly known as the Pasco prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and are adapted to store water. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pascoensis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing typical adaptations for desert life. Its structure and growth patterns make it a notable example of xerophytic evolution in the Cactaceae family."
