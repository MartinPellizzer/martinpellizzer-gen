    "intro": "Oncoba capreifolia, commonly known as the Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Oncoba capreifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. It is also sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
