    "intro": "Otostegia fruticosa subsp. fruticosa, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features woody stems and produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are usually small, opposite, and sometimes hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. Otostegia fruticosa subsp. fruticosa is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
