    "intro": "Oyedaea helianthoides, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by a crown of bracts that resemble a dandelion's puffball. Oyedaea helianthoides is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
