    "intro": "Oreocarya jonesiana, commonly known as the Jones' oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Oreocarya jonesiana is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
