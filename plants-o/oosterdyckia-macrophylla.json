    "intro": "Oosterdyckia macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant, and its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the early morning. Oosterdyckia macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
