    "intro": "Opuntia funalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits known as tunas. Opuntia funalis is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily during the day. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient and distinctive member of the Cactaceae family."
