    "intro": "Orthaea medusula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. Orthaea medusula thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects."
