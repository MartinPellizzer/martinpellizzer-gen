    "intro": "Ophrys heldreichii subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the Pusilla Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male pollinators through a process called pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
