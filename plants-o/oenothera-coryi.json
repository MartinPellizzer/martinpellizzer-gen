    "intro": "Oenothera coryi, commonly known as the Sierra Nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, ribbed stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Oenothera coryi is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting nocturnal pollinators."
