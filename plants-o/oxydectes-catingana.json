It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through specialized root systems and water-storing tissues. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, reducing water loss. Oxydectes catingana plays a significant role in its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of desert flora."
