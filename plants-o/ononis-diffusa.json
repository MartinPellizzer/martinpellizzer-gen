    "intro": "Ononis diffusa, commonly known as sandrocket, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose, nutrient-poor soils. Ononis diffusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent soil erosion."
