    "intro": "Oldenlandia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling spider-like structures, hence its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
