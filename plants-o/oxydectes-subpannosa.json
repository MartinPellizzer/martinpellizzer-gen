It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Oxydectes subpannosa is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields."
