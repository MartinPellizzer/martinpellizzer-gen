    "intro": "Osmia rhinanthacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved leafcutter bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive narrow, linear leaves that are used to construct its nest. The plant it interacts with, such as various flowering plants, provides nectar and pollen for the bee's diet. Its nesting behavior involves cutting precise leaf pieces to form the cell walls of its brood chamber. This species plays an important role in pollination and is often found in gardens and meadows."
