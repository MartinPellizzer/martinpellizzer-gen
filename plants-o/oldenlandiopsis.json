    "intro": "Oldenlandiopsis, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of approximately 12 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in composite heads. They often have a hairy or glandular surface, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. The genus is notable for its ecological adaptability and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
