    "intro": "Onobrychis schugnanica f. villosa, commonly known as the silky sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely pubescent stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that are clustered in racemes, and it is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats. Its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in poor soils, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. The variety f. villosa is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which gives it a distinctive silvery appearance."
