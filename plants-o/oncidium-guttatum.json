    "intro": "Oncidium guttatum, commonly known as the Spotted Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of 10 to 20. The plant features long, strap-like leaves and has a sympodial growth habit, meaning it grows laterally from the base. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium guttatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
