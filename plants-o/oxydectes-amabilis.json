    "intro": "Oxydectes amabilis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a tendency to spread through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some areas. Oxydectes amabilis is often found in wetlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils where it thrives in moist conditions."
