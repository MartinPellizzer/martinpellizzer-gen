    "intro": "Orobanche lavandulacea f. crassipes, commonly known as the thick-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, fleshy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. This species typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with leguminous plants. Its flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a tubular shape that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
