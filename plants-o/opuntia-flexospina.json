    "intro": "Opuntia flexospina, commonly known as the spineless prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Opuntia flexospina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
