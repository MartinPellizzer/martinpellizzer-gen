    "intro": "Oncidium cucullatum var. spathulatum, commonly known as the Spatulate Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features pendant, strap-like flowers that are typically yellow or green with red or orange markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. This orchid thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
