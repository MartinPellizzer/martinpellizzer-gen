    "intro": "Orchis sesquipedalis, commonly known as the long-root orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a loose raceme. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The orchid's root system is extensive, contributing to its common name and playing a role in its ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
