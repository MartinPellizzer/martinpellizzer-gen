    "intro": "Oryza monandra var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered ricegrass, is a lesser-known variant of the rice genus native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and striking, large white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for wetland or marshy habitats. Its botanical features include a slender stem and small, rice-like grains that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
