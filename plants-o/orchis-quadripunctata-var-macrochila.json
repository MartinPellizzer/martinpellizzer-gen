It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that typically have a purple or violet hue with a prominent, elongated lip. The plant grows in woodland and grassland habitats, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths."
