    "intro": "Orbignya trifoliata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. These seeds are rich in nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, and essential minerals. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
