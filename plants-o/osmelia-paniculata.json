It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of swamps, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy. Osmelia paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
