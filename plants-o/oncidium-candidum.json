    "intro": "Oncidium candidum, commonly known as the sweet orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Oncidium candidum is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent humidity to thrive, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
