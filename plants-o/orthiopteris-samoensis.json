    "intro": "Orthiopteris samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas efficiently. The fronds are compound, with small, serrated leaflets that help in maximizing light absorption for photosynthesis."
