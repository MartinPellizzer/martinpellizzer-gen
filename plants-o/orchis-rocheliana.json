    "intro": "Orchis rocheliana, commonly known as the Rochel's orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single, showy orchid-like flower that is usually purple or violet in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, and it produces a distinctive, elongated seed capsule upon flowering. Orchis rocheliana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens and conservation sites."
