    "intro": "Ornithopteris wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically broad and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
