    "intro": "Ophelia florida, commonly known as the water poppy, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often floating on the water's surface. Its roots are adapted to thrive in muddy or aquatic soils, making it a common sight in ponds and slow-moving streams. Ophelia florida is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
