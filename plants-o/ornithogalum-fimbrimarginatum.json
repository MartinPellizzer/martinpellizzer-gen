    "intro": "Ornithogalum fimbrimarginatum, commonly known as the fringe-edged star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive fringed edge. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and blooms in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and spread easily in suitable conditions."
