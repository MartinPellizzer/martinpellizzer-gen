    "intro": "Ononis sicula var. major, commonly known as the Greater Ononis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
