    "intro": "Onobrychis declivium, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Onobrychis declivium is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
