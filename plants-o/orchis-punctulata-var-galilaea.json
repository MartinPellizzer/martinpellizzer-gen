    "intro": "Orchis punctulata var. galilaea, commonly known as the Galilaea orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates in which it thrives. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
