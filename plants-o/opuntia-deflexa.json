    "intro": "Opuntia deflexa, commonly known as the lowland prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia deflexa is adapted to arid environments and has spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for survival in desert and semi-desert regions."
