    "intro": "Oroya subocculta var. pluricentralis, commonly known as the multi-centered oroya, is a rare and intriguing plant species characterized by its unique growth pattern. This variant exhibits multiple central stems, which diverge from a single point, creating a distinctive, almost star-like appearance. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is native to high-altitude regions of South America, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring."
