    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. sublancea, commonly known as the slender royal fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of its reproductive biology."
