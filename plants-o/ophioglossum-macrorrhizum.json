    "intro": "Ophioglossum macrorrhizum, commonly known as the large-leaf adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It possesses a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, large, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two distinct lobes. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called sporangium clusters on the underside of its leaf, which are typically arranged in a row. Ophioglossum macrorrhizum is known for its primitive features, including its lack of true leaves and its reliance on spores for reproduction. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats and is considered a relic of early fern evolution."
