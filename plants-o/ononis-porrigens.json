    "intro": "Ononis porrigens, commonly known as creeping eryngo, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense umbels. Ononis porrigens thrives in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
