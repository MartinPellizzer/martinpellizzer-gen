    "intro": "Orobanche amethystea subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other species. The plant is characterized by its purple or violet flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
