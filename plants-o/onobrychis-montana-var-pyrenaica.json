    "intro": "Onobrychis montana var. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean burclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. This species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
