    "intro": "Ottonia warakabacoura var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ottonia, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
