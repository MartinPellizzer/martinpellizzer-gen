    "intro": "[WRONG START] Orchis \u00d7 feinbruniais, commonly known as the Feinbrun hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Carpathian regions. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers with a distinctive hooded structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
