    "intro": "Onoclea obtusilobata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water and wetlands, with its leaves floating on the surface or submerged. The plant has broad, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms."
