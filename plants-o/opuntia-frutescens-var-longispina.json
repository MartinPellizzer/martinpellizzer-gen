    "intro": "Opuntia frutescens var. longispina, commonly known as the long-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are covered in sharp spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in warmer climates."
