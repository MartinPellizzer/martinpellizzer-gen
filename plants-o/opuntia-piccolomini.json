    "intro": "Opuntia piccolomini, commonly known as the Piccolomini prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy pads, known as cladodes, which are covered in fine spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruit, called a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, juicy texture. Opuntia piccolomini is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems."
