It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and its clusters of fragrant, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its flowers have a unique structure with prominent, tooth-like projections on the lip, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Odontoglossum. This species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
