    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 ambrosii, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). The plant is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral morphology, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. Its flowers feature a distinctive lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee, attracting male bees for pollination. This species thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats across Europe."
