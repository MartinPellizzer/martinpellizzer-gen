    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. nord-chinensis, commonly known as the northern Chinese rice variety, is a cultivated form of rice native to northern China. It is characterized by its short, compact grain and typically grows in temperate climates with a shorter growing season. The plant has a robust root system that helps it withstand cooler temperatures and shorter daylight periods. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its adaptability to cooler regions and its use in traditional Chinese agriculture."
