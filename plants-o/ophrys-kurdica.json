    "intro": "Ophrys kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that closely resembles a female bee, a trait known as mimicry. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single upright flowering stem. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with brown markings, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. Ophrys kurdica is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in high-altitude grasslands and open woodlands."
