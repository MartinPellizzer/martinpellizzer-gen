    "intro": "Oldenlandia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in clusters, often in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant has heart-shaped or oval leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Oldenlandia uniflora is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
