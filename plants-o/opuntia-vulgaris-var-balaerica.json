    "intro": "Opuntia vulgaris var. balaerica, commonly known as the Canary Island prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features flat, paddle-like stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its adaptations to arid environments include thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaf surfaces. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and as a source of food and traditional medicine."
