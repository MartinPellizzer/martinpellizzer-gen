    "intro": "Oncidium teres, commonly known as the curly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, long-lasting flowers that often display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in dry environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Oncidium teres is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of care and striking floral displays."
