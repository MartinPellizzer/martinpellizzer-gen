    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. karadenizensis, commonly known as the Karadeniz Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the northeastern regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Ophrys genus, which is known for its specialized pollination mechanisms involving mimicry of female insects. The plant produces strikingly intricate flowers that resemble female wasps, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
