    "intro": "Onoseris triplinervia, commonly known as the three-veined goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading herb with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its yellow flowers are arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Onoseris triplinervia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, showing features such as deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
