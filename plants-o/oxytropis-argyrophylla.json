    "intro": "Oxytropis argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow to golden yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
