    "intro": "Oncidium lindleyanum, commonly known as the Yellow Butterfly Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like shape, which bloom in clusters along the stem. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and slightly recurved, providing a lush backdrop for its showy blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium lindleyanum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
