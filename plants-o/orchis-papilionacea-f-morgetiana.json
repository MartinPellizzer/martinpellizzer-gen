    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea f. morgetiana, commonly known as the Morgetian Butterfly Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that resemble butterflies, with a distinctive violet-blue coloration and intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and a slender, erect stem that supports its single or few flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
