    "intro": "Omphalocaryon muscosum, commonly known as the mossy liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structure and a preference for moist, shaded environments. The plant typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood, forming dense, carpet-like mats. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on specialized stems called setae. Omphalocaryon muscosum plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
