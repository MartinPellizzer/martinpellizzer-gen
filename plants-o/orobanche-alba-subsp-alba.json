    "intro": "Orobanche alba subsp. alba, commonly known as the white broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in various habitats across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing on grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with host roots, where it attaches via haustoria to extract water and nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a role in ecological systems but can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
