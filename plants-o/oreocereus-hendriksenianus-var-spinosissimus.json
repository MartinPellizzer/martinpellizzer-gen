    "intro": "Oreocereus hendriksenianus var. spinosissimus, commonly known as the spiny moon cactus, is a unique cacti species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its swollen, globular stem that resembles a moon, covered in spines that provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, white flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution, it is a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts."
