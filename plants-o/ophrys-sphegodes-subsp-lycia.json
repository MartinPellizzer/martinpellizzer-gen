    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. lycia, commonly known as the Lycian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like appearance, complete with a pseudostigma and a labellum that mimics the body of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
