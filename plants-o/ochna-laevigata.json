    "intro": "Ochna laevigata, commonly known as the smooth ochna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Ochna laevigata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
