    "intro": "Onobrychis saxatilis var. genuina, commonly known as the rock clover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
