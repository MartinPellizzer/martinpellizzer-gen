    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. subcurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid in its subcurva form, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and slightly curved, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces tall, unbranched stems that bear clusters of violet or purple flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids. Its flowers are often adorned with a yellowish-green keel and a hood-like upper lip. This orchid thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in association with other orchid species."
