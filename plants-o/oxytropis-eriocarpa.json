    "intro": "Oxytropis eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native flora."
