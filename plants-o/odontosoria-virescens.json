    "intro": "Odontosoria virescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered in fine, scale-like structures. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and contain spores for propagation."
