    "intro": "Oreogrammitis tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate chain fern, is a unique fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tuberculate (bumpy) fronds that give it a rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
