It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically spreads along the ground, forming a dense mat of foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
