    "intro": "Oxytropis sutakensis, commonly known as the Sutakhen milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, with slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Oxytropis sutakensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
