    "intro": "Oncostemum dracaenifolium, commonly known as the African peace lily, is a tropical plant native to Central and Eastern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers that emerge from a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncostemum dracaenifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its air-purifying qualities and low maintenance requirements."
