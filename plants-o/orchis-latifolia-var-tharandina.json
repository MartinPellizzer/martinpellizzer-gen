    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. tharandina, commonly known as the Tharandian broad-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, upright flowering stems that bear clusters of violet to purple flowers. This orchid is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host plants through specialized roots. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
