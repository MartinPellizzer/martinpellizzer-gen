    "intro": "Olmedia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf olmedia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in xeriscaping."
