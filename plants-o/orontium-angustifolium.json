    "intro": "Orontium angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it produces tiny, floating fruits that disperse seeds by water. Orontium angustifolium plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
