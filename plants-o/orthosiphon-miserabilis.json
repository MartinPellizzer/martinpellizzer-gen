    "intro": "Orthosiphon miserabilis, commonly known as the bitter leaf or Malabar spinach, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Orthosiphon miserabilis is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects."
