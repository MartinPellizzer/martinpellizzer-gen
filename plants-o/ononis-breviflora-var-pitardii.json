    "intro": "Ononis breviflora var. pitardii, commonly known as the Pitard's whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as cliffs and coastal areas. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. The variety is distinguished by its slightly shorter flower stems compared to the typical form of Ononis breviflora."
