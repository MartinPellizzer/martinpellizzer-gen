It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in desert environments. The plant features compound leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. Orobus exaltatus is also sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
