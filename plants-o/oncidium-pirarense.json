    "intro": "Oncidium pirarense, commonly known as the Purple Orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It features vibrant purple and white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a fan shape. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and grass-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Oncidium pirarense thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
