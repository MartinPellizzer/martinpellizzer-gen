    "intro": "Ouratea duidae, commonly known as the Brazilian angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has smooth, glossy leaves and produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens, though care must be taken due to its toxic properties."
