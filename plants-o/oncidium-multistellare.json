    "intro": "Oncidium multistellare, commonly known as the starry orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It features elongated, pendant-like pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers with yellow and white petals, often resembling stars, hence its common name. Oncidium multistellare thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its botanical structure includes a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb producing a single leaf and a flower spike."
