    "intro": "Oetosis zosterifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-blue foliage, which are adapted to tolerate saline and windy conditions. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Oetosis zosterifolia is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal environments."
