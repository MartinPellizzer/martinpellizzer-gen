It features long, arching stems that bear clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with red or purple markings. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, often with a waxy texture and a dark green color. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is prized for its elegant appearance and relatively easy care, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
