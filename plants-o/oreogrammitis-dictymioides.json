    "intro": "Oreogrammitis dictymioides, commonly known as the slender wall fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that grow in a compact, upright habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant's spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a continuous line along the veins. Oreogrammitis dictymioides thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on cliff faces. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
