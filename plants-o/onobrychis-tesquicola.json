    "intro": "Onobrychis tesquicola, commonly known as the narrowleaf burclover, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several small, round seeds. Onobrychis tesquicola plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
