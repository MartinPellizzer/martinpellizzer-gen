    "intro": "Oleandra articulata f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless oleander, is a variant of the oleander species characterized by its reduced or absent glandular structures on the leaves and stems. It is a shrub native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a velvety texture. While it is less common than other oleander varieties, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
