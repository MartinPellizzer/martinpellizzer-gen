It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a short, erect stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
