    "intro": "Ophrys funerea subsp. fleischmannii, commonly known as the funeral orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black petals and sepals, which resemble funeral shrouds, giving it its common name. This orchid is typically found in rocky or limestone habitats, often in mountainous regions of Europe. Its flowers are highly specialized, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by certain bee species. The subspecies is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a conservation concern due to habitat degradation and over-collection."
