    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. lapponica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and heathlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves, and it produces a tall spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. This variety is notable for its ecological significance, supporting specific pollinators and contributing to biodiversity in its native habitats."
