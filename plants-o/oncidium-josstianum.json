    "intro": "Oncidium josstianum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous, showy inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture from the air. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Oncidium josstianum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
