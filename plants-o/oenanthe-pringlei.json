    "intro": "Oenanthe pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's water-dropwort, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Oenanthe pringlei is often found in areas with cool, temperate climates and is relatively rare in its native range."
