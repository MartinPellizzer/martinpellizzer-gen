    "intro": "Oncidium volubile, commonly known as the climbing orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that allow it to climb and spread over other vegetation. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-green flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape. Oncidium volubile thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for hanging baskets or trained on trellises due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
