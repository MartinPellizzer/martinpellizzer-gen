    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 llenasii var. breviappendiculata, commonly known as the short-appendiculate bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color. This variant is notable for its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability within its native range."
