    "intro": "Oncidium olivaceum var. sanguinolentum, commonly known as the blood-red orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, scarlet flowers with a distinctive red coloration that stands out against its green foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforest environments. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded conditions. The flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late spring or early summer, adding a striking visual element to its natural habitat."
