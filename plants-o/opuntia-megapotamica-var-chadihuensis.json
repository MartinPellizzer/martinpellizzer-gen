    "intro": "Opuntia megapotamica var. chadihuensis, commonly known as the Chadihuense prickly pear, is a cacti species native to northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It is characterized by its flat, pad-like stems that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its spines are modified leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
