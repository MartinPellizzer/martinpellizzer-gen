    "intro": "Opuntia leonina, commonly known as the Leonine prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are often used for photosynthesis. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia leonina is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in various cultures."
