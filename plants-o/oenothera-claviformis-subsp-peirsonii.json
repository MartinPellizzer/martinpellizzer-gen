    "intro": "Oenothera claviformis subsp. peirsonii, commonly known as the Peirson's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that open in the evening, a trait typical of many species in the genus Oenothera. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in xeric habitats."
