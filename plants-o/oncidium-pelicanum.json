    "intro": "Oncidium pelicanum, commonly known as the pelican orchid, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous plant with a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on trees in humid tropical environments. Oncidium pelicanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
