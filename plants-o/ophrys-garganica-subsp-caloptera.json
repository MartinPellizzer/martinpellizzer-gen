    "intro": "Ophrys garganica subsp. caloptera, commonly known as the Garganica bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
