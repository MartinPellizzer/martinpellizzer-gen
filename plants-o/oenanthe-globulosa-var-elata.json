    "intro": "Oenanthe globulosa var. elata, commonly known as the tall globular water dropwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, rounded, globe-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. This variant is adapted to wetland habitats and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and slow-moving streams."
