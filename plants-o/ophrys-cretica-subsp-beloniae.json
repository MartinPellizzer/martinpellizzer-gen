It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking combination of yellow and brown hues. This subspecies is notable for its evolutionary adaptation to mimic pollinators, enhancing its reproductive success."
