    "intro": "Orobanche panormitana, commonly known as the Mediterranean broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, thick stem with no true leaves. It typically parasitizes species of the genus Brassica, such as cabbage and mustard. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as a specialized parasite."
