    "intro": "Oreocarya procera, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Oreocarya procera is known for its early spring blooming period, adding color to mountain landscapes before the summer vegetation emerges."
