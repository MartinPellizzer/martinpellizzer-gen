    "intro": "Oxalis pageae, commonly known as the Page's wood sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive veins and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage resembles that of true sorrels, though it is not related to the genus Rumex. Oxalis pageae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
