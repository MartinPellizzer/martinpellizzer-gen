    "intro": "Ophrys speculum subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Mirror Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a distinctive mirror-like reflective surface on the lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its floral structure is highly specialized, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals designed to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
