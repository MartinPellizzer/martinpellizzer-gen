    "intro": "Opuntia ventanensis, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. Opuntia ventanensis is also notable for its ability to store water in its stems, making it highly drought-resistant."
