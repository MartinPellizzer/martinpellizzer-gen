    "intro": "Opuntia tuberculata, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments called cladodes, which are modified leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia tuberculata is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems."
