    "intro": "Oplismenus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered grass or narrowleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with a unique structure that includes cyathia, which are cup-like clusters containing both male and female flowers. Oplismenus fasciculatus is often found in wetland ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
