It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. This cultivar is valued for its delicate appearance and is often used in garden design for its subtle, elegant blooms."
