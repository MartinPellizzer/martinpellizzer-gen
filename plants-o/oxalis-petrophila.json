    "intro": "Oxalis petrophila, commonly known as the rock oxalis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Oxalis petrophila is adapted to mild, moist climates and is sensitive to frost and drought. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species."
