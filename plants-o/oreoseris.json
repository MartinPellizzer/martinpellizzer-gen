    "intro": "Oreoseris, commonly known as the African dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and consists of several species, many of which are characterized by their dandelion-like appearance. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and their flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets. Oreoseris species are often found in grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
