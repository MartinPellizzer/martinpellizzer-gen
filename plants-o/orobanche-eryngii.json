    "intro": "Orobanche eryngii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of members of the legume family. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth and development of its host, making it an important subject in ecological studies. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops."
