It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are arranged in a loose raceme and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. This hybrid species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
