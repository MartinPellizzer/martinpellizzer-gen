It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bright red, spherical fruits known as rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in herbal medicine. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
