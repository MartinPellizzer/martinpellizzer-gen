    "intro": "Oenothera elata subsp. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its stems are usually slender and hairy, and it has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its adaptation to arid environments."
