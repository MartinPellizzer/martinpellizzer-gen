    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. helios, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that aid in its mimicry. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
