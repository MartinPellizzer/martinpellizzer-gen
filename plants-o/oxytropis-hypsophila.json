    "intro": "Oxytropis hypsophila, commonly known as the alpine bur pea, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces hairy, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Oxytropis hypsophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh, arid conditions and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
