    "intro": "Oxalis frigida, commonly known as the cold oxalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, delicate leaves that are trifoliate, resembling those of the common wood sorrel. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Oxalis frigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
