    "intro": "Ornithogalum aurantiacum, commonly known as the red-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink to red in color, arranged in a star-like pattern. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and it blooms in late spring or early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
