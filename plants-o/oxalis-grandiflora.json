    "intro": "Oxalis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces clusters of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season. Oxalis grandiflora is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
