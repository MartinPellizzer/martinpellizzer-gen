It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. Its aromatic foliage is used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for its antimicrobial properties. Oxydectes verbenifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments."
