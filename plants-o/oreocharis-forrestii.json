    "intro": "Oreocharis forrestii, commonly known as the Yunnan bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine layer of hair, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreocharis forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern."
