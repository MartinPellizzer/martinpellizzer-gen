    "intro": "Ornithoxanthum sternbergii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant is typically low-growing, with gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Ornithoxanthum sternbergii is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
