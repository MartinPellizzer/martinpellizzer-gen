    "intro": "Oxygraphis salsuginosus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a distinctive, sometimes aromatic scent. Oxygraphis salsuginosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
