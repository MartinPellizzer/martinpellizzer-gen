    "intro": "Orchis dulukae subsp. camparonensis, commonly known as the Camparon orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its morphology includes a slender rhizome and a single, erect stem bearing a few flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
