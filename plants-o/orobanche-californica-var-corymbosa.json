    "intro": "Orobanche californica var. corymbosa, commonly known as the California broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is native to western North America, particularly California. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species such as Astragalus and Crotalaria. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats and can be an indicator of certain soil conditions. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its habitat."
