    "intro": "Orchis coriophora var. genuina, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It has a short flowering period in late spring and is often found in association with other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
