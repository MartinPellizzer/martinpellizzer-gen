    "intro": "Oenanthe michelfeldensis, commonly known as the Michelfeld's water dropwort, is a rare flowering plant native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and wet meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, waxy coating. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
