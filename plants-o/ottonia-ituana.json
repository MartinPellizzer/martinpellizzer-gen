    "intro": "Ottonia ituana, commonly known as the Ituana orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires specific microclimatic conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ottonia ituana is considered a vulnerable species."
