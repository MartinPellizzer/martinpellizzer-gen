    "intro": "Ophioglossum konkanensis, commonly known as the Konkan adder's mouth, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted sporangia, which are clustered at the end of the fertile stalk. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, upright sterile frond and a separate, elongated fertile frond. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically in dense forests or rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
