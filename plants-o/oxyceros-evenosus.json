    "intro": "Oxyceros evenosus, commonly known as the slender sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its narrow, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Oxyceros evenosus is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
