    "intro": "Ophrys minor subsp. galilaea, commonly known as the Galilee bee orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the Galilee region of Israel. It is characterized by its striking bee-like floral morphology, with a showy, yellowish-brown lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
