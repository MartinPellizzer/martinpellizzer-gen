    "intro": "Oberonia dolabrata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender, wiry stem with fleshy, ovate leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a distinctive species within the Orchidaceae family."
