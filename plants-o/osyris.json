It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its showy, often pink or white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and ovate to lance-shaped. Osyris species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as swamps and riverbanks, and some species are used in traditional medicine."
