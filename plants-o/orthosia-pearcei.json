    "intro": "Orthosia pearcei, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in the spring. Orthosia pearcei is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can go through periods of dormancy during extreme drought."
