    "intro": "Oxalis pyrenea var. pyrenea, commonly known as the flame violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves with a deep red or purple hue, often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats of foliage."
