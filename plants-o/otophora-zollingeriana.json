    "intro": "Otophora zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of white to pale yellow blossoms that are highly attractive to pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in cloud forests with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its alpine environment and its role in local ecosystems."
