    "intro": "Othonna divaricata, commonly known as the variable othonna, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant for dry climates. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
