    "intro": "Oxalis oregana, commonly known as the Oregon wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive reddish veins and produces small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is edible, though it contains oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Oxalis oregana plays a role in supporting local wildlife and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
