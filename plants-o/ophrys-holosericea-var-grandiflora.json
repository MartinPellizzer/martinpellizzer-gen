    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, which features a prominent, hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant produces showy, yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive, elongated spur. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges, often in calcareous soils. The orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, attracting male bees through its floral mimicry."
