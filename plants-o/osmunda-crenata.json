    "intro": "Osmunda crenata, commonly known as the fragrant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in water gardens and as ornamental plants. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Osmunda crenata has a unique ability to absorb and release gases, which helps maintain water quality in its habitat."
