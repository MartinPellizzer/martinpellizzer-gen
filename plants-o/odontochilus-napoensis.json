    "intro": "Odontochilus napoensis, commonly known as the Napo toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive toothed leaf margins. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white flowers with a fragrant scent, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
