    "intro": "Opuntia atrocapensis, commonly known as the black-capped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South Africa. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Its areoles, which are clusters of spines, also bear small glochids, which are fine, barbed bristles. Opuntia atrocapensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a slow growth rate."
