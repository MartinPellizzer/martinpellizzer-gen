    "intro": "Oenothera tafiensis, commonly known as the Tafiense Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oenothera tafiensis is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
