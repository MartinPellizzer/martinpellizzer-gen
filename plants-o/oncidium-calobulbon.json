    "intro": "Oncidium calobulbon, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green foliage and produces long, pendulous flower spikes with showy, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are hermaphroditic, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive structures. Oncidium calobulbon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
