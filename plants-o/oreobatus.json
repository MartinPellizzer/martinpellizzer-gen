    "intro": "Oreobatus, commonly known as the Arizona bark scorpion, is a venomous arachnid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. While not a plant, it is often confused with botanical terms due to its name, which does not refer to a plant species. The name \"Oreobatus\" is derived from Greek, meaning \"mountain biter,\" reflecting its habitat and behavior. It is important to clarify that Oreobatus is an arachnid, not a plant, and thus has no botanical characteristics. This clarification is essential to avoid confusion with actual plant species."
