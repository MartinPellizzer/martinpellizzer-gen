    "intro": "Oxytheca parishii var. abramsii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, dandelion-like flowers and hairy, succulent leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
