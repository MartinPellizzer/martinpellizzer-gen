    "intro": "Oxalis seatonii, commonly known as the seatonii wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a low-growing perennial that produces edible leaves and flowers, though they are often more ornamental than culinary. Oxalis seatonii is valued in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience in dry conditions."
