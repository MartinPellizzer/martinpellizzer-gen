    "intro": "Oxalis talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white veins. The plant produces clusters of small, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to white. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes."
