    "intro": "Orobanche galii var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic dwarf broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. This species typically parasitizes grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Its distribution is primarily in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing the growth and diversity of its host species."
