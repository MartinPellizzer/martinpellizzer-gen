    "intro": "Orobanche vitellina, commonly known as the yellow barrenstar, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in a spikelike inflorescence. Its life cycle involves germination in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly weaken its host and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
