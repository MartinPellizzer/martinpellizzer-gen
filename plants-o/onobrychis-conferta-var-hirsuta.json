    "intro": "Onobrychis conferta var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves distinguishes it from other varieties of sweet clover."
