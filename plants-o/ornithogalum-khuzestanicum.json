    "intro": "Ornithogalum khuzestanicum, commonly known as the Khuzestan star-of-Bethleham, is a perennial herb native to the Iranian plateau. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
