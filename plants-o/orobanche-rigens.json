    "intro": "Orobanche rigens, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various species within the Brassicaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow or green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth cycle of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil for extended periods. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
