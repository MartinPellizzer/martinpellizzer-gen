    "intro": "Opuntia violacea, commonly known as the violet prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia violacea is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
