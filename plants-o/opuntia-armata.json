    "intro": "Opuntia armata, commonly known as the Mexican fire cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, spineless pads that store water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia armata is adapted to arid environments, with a shallow root system that allows it to absorb moisture efficiently. Its structure and growth habits make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and as a decorative plant."
