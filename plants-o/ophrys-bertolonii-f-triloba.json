    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii f. triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed bee orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces striking, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its specialized pollination mechanism and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
