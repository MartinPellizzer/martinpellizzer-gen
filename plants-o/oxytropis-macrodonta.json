    "intro": "Oxytropis macrodonta, commonly known as the largeleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, elongated racemes. Oxytropis macrodonta is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod, which helps in dispersal and survival in arid environments."
