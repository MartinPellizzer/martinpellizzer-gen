It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible, fleshy fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. Opuntia cantabrigiensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
