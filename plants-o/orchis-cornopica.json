    "intro": "Orchis cornopica, commonly known as the corn poppy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects. The orchid is also noted for its tall, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves."
