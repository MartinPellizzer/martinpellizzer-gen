    "intro": "Obione iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its elegant appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Obione iljinii is considered a vulnerable species."
