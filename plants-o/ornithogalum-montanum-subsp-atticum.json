    "intro": "Ornithogalum montanum subsp. atticum, commonly known as the Attic bulbous star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It features a bulbous stem base with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
