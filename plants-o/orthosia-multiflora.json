    "intro": "Orthosia multiflora, commonly known as the mountain bluet, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Orthosia multiflora plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
