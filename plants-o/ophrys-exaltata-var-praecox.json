    "intro": "Ophrys exaltata var. praecox, commonly known as the early bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, bee-mimicking flowers that are pale yellow with a dark brown or black lip. The flowers are specialized for pollination by bees, with a pouch-like structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It blooms in early spring, often before the main flowering season of other orchids. This plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
