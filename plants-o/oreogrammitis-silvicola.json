    "intro": "Oreogrammitis silvicola, commonly known as the forest wall-rush, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. The plant produces delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its reproductive strategy involves the dispersal of minute seeds, which are often carried by wind or water. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, O. silvicola is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
