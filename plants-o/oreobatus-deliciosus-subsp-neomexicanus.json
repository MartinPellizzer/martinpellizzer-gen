    "intro": "Oreobatus deliciosus subsp. neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico prickly pear cactus, is a succulent species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert regions."
