    "intro": "Orobanche buekii, commonly known as the Buek's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and stems, with only a short, swollen stem and a cluster of flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops by reducing their growth and yield."
