    "intro": "Opuntia humifusa var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded prickly pear, is a low-growing cactus native to the southeastern United States. It features flat, fleshy pads covered in clusters of small spines and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
