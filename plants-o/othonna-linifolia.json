    "intro": "Othonna linifolia, commonly known as the silky othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, velvety texture, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
