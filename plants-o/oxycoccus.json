    "intro": "Oxycoccus, commonly known as the crowberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These shrubs are native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor soils. The plants produce small, dark blue or black berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Oxycoccus species are characterized by their low-growing habit and dense, evergreen foliage. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in harsh environments."
