It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, needle-like leaves and delicate blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Ornithopus minimus is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in regions with low precipitation."
