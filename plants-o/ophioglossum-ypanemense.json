    "intro": "Ophioglossum ypanemense, commonly known as the Ypanemense adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its primitive and unique morphological features. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a single, large, lance-shaped leaf that is often divided into two parts. Its spore-bearing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive, tongue-like structure at the base of the leaf. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophioglossum ypanemense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
