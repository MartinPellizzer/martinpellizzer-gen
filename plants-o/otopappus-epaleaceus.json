It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Otopappus epaleaceus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
