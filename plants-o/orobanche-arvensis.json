    "intro": "Orobanche arvensis, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other crops. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique structure with a fleshy, branched stem. It is often found in agricultural fields and disturbed soils, making it a significant weed in farming areas. Its life cycle and parasitic nature make it a challenge for crop management."
