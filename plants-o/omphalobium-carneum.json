    "intro": "Omphalobium carneum, commonly known as the pink burr medic, is a perennial legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Omphalobium carneum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil rehabilitation and pasture improvement."
