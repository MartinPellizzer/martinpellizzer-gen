    "intro": "Orcuttia californica var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky orcuttia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle floral presence to its environment. Its unique adaptations, such as sticky secretions on the stems, are believed to deter herbivores and aid in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
