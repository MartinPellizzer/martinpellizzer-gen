    "intro": "Outreya, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Outreya is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its blooming period typically occurs in spring and early summer, adding ornamental value to gardens in desert climates."
