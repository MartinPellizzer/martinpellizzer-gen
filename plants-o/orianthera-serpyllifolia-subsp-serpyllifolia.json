    "intro": "Orianthera serpyllifolia subsp. serpyllifolia, commonly known as common sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. This subspecies is notable for its ability to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
