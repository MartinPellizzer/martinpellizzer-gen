    "intro": "Osmunda imbricata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, floating fronds that are adapted for aquatic environments. It belongs to the genus Osmunda, which includes several species of royal ferns, and is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere. The plant's fronds are typically divided into segments that overlap like shingles, a feature that gives it its scientific name \"imbricata,\" meaning \"overlapping.\" Osmunda imbricata thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
