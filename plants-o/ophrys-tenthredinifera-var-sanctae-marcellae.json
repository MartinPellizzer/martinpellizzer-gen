    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera var. sanctae-marcellae, commonly known as the Holy Marcella orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait known as pseudocopulation, used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, with distinctive markings that aid in its deceptive pollination strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in several regions."
