    "intro": "Oligochaetochilus despectans, commonly known as the spiky moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a layer of fine, waxy cells, which help it retain moisture. It is a non-vascular plant, meaning it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves in the traditional sense. Oligochaetochilus despectans plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
