    "intro": "Oroya subocculta var. fusca, commonly known as the dark oroya, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive dark purple to almost black foliage, which sets it apart from other varieties in the genus. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane regions of South America. Its flowers are small and pale, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
