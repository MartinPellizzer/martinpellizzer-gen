    "intro": "Orobanche multiflora var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its specialized structure for attaching to host roots. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
