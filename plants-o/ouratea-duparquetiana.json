It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
