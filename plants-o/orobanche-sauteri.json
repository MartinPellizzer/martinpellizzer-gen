    "intro": "Orobanche sauteri, commonly known as the Sauteri broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The plant produces showy, often pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, often parasitizing species of the genera Astragalus and Hedysarum. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it can be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
