    "intro": "Ophrys vernixia subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the flowers are pale green with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
