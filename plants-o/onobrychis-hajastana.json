It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil environments. Onobrychis hajastana is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
