    "intro": "Orania ravaka, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, Orania ravaka is now classified as an endangered species."
