    "intro": "Osyris mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean osyris, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Osyris mediterranea is also valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
