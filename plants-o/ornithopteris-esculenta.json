    "intro": "Ornithopteris esculenta, commonly known as the edible feather fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread in suitable habitats. The edible parts of the plant, particularly the young fronds, are consumed in various local dishes."
