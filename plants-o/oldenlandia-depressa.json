    "intro": "Oldenlandia depressa, commonly known as the prostrate spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with sprawling stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Oldenlandia depressa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
