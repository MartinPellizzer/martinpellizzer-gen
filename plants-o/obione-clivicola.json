    "intro": "Obione clivicola, commonly known as the cliff-dwelling orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique adaptations to harsh conditions. The plant typically produces small, intricate flowers with vivid colors, often in shades of purple and yellow. Its roots are highly developed to anchor it in crevices and absorb moisture from the air. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, Obione clivicola is considered a vulnerable species."
