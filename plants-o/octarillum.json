    "intro": "Octarillum, commonly known as the \"buttercup plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and its clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Octarillum species often have a creeping rhizome system that allows them to spread and colonize new areas. Some species are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
