    "intro": "Oreocarya leucophaea var. confertiflora, commonly known as the denseflower whitebark, is a variant of the whitebark plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically small, needle-like, and arranged in a whorled pattern around the stems. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
