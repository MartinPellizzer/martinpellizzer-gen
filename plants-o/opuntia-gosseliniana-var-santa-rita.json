    "intro": "Opuntia gosseliniana var. santa-rita, commonly known as Santa Rita prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features flattened, fleshy stems that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, slightly tart flavor. The plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
