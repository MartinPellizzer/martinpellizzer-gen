    "intro": "Oncidium stramineum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellow to orange flowers resembling butterflies. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are often used for propagation. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium stramineum is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
