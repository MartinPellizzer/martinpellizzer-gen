    "intro": "Orobanche rapum-genistae subsp. rigens, commonly known as the rigid dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish, thread-like stems that wrap around host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It primarily parasitizes leguminous plants, such as vetch and clover, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively affect the growth and yield of its host plants."
