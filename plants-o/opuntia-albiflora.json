    "intro": "Opuntia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. The plant produces yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia albiflora is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
