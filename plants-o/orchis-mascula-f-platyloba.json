    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. platyloba, commonly known as the flat-lipped male orchid, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant of the male orchid. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a broad, flat lip that distinguishes it from other orchid forms. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland habitats across Europe. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and green, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
