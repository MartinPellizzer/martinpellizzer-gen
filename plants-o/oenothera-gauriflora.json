It is characterized by its large, showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically 3 to 5 inches in diameter, with five petals that curl inward as they age. Oenothera gauriflora is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
