    "intro": "Orobanche hygrophila, commonly known as the water broom. It is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Lens. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Orobanche hygrophila is often found in moist, temperate regions and is considered a rare and elusive species."
