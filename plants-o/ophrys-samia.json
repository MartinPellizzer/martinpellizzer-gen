    "intro": "Ophrys samia, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its specialized flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in various parts of Europe. Its flowers are usually a mix of yellow, brown, and black, with a distinctive bee-like shape. Ophrys samia is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
