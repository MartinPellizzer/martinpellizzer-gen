    "intro": "Ophrys ferrum-equinum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser copper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of an insect. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown and reddish hues, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
