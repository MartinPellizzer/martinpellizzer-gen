    "intro": "Ophrys helios, commonly known as the sun orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, butterfly-like flowers that mimic the appearance of female wasps, a trait known as mimicry. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with a contrasting dark pattern, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. Ophrys helios is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often with a single, showy bloom per stem."
