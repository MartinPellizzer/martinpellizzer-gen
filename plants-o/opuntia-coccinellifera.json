    "intro": "Opuntia coccinellifera, commonly known as the red-fleshed prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that are typically green or red in color, which store water for survival in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its flat, paddle-shaped leaves, called cladodes, are covered in spines that deter herbivores. Opuntia coccinellifera is also valued for its edible fruits and has cultural significance in many regions."
