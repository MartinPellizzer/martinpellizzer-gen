    "intro": "Oparanthus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
