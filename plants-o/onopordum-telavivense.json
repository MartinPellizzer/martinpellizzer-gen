    "intro": "Onopordum telavivense, commonly known as Jerusalem thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Onopordum telavivense is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and distinctive appearance."
