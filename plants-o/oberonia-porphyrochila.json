    "intro": "Oberonia porphyrochila, commonly known as the crimson orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple and red petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, often arranged in a dense inflorescence. Oberonia porphyrochila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
