    "intro": "Opuntia reflexa, commonly known as the soft prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of small, soft spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Opuntia reflexa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
