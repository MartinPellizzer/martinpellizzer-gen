    "intro": "Oncidium incurvum, commonly known as the hook orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its pendulous inflorescences bearing clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with dark markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, adapted for moisture retention. Oncidium incurvum is valued in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
