    "intro": "Oxydectes gossypifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the woollyleaf cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, while the stems are thick and ribbed. This variant is notable for its variation in leaf shape, which can range from broad to narrow, depending on environmental conditions."
