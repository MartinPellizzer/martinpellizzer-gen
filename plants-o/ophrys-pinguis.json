    "intro": "Ophrys pinguis, commonly known as the fat helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled green and brown leaves and its showy, lip-like flower that resembles a female bee, aiding in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ophrys pinguis is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in association with other orchid species."
