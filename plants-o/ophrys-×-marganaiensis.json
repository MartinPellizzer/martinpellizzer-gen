    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 marganaiensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a rare orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its striking, bee-like floral morphology, with a velvety pouch and intricate markings that mimic the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils in open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges, across southern Europe. Its flowers are pollinated by male bees that attempt to mate with the flower's pseudocopulation structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys \u00d7 marganaiensis is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
