    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pulcherrima, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, characterized by its distinctive flower structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its flowers are specialized for mimicry, attracting male bees for pollination through a process called pseudocopulation. The species is valued in horticulture for its unique and showy blooms, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
