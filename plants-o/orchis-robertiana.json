    "intro": "Orchis robertiana, commonly known as Robert's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the British Isles. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single or few flowers per stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
