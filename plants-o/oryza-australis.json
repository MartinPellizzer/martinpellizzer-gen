    "intro": "Oryza australis, commonly known as the Australian ricegrass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or pale yellow in color. Oryza australis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is not cultivated for food but is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its adaptability to harsh environments."
