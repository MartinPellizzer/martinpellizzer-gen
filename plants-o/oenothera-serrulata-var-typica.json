    "intro": "Oenothera serrulata var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf evening primrose, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are followed by elongated seed pods that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky soils."
