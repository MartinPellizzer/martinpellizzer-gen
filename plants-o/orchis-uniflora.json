    "intro": "Orchis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its single, showy violet or purple flower that stands above a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Native to the temperate regions of Europe, this orchid thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orchis uniflora is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
