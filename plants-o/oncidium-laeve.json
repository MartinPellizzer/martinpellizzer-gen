    "intro": "Oncidium laeve, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Oncidium laeve is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced orchid growers."
