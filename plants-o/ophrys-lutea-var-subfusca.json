    "intro": "Ophrys lutea var. subfusca, commonly known as the brown bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its brownish-yellow flowers that resemble a bee, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while the flower spike bears a single, showy flower. This orchid is a perennial, flowering in spring and relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
