    "intro": "Oxypetalum proboscideum, commonly known as the giant waxflower, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy, waxy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, displaying a range of colors from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with thick, woody stems and broad, palmate leaves. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Oxypetalum proboscideum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its dramatic floral display."
