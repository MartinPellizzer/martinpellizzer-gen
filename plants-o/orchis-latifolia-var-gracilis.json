    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender broad-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale purple to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, with each flower having three sepals and three petals. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
