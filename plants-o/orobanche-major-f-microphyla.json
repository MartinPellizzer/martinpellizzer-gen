    "intro": "Orobanche major f. microphyla, commonly known as the dwarf yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with legumes such as vetch and clover. Its small stature and reduced leaves are adaptations to its parasitic lifestyle. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique ecological role and potential as a model for understanding parasitic plant biology."
