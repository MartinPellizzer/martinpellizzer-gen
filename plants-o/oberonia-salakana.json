The plant features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Oberonia salakana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
