It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow composite flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize disturbed soils. Oreoherzogia pumila is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
