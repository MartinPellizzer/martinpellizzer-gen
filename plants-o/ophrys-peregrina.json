    "intro": "Ophrys peregrina, commonly known as the wandering helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its unique, bee-like floral structure that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, dark green surface. Its flowers, which are usually greenish-yellow with brown markings, bloom from late spring to early summer. Ophrys peregrina is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
