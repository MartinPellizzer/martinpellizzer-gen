    "intro": "Ophioglossum coriaceum, commonly known as the broad-leaved adder's-tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in a distinctive tongue-like shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
