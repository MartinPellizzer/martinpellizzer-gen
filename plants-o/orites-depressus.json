    "intro": "Orites depressus, commonly known as the dwarf orites, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Orites depressus thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
