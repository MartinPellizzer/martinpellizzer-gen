It is characterized by its spiny leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in scrublands and wastelands. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in herbal remedies."
