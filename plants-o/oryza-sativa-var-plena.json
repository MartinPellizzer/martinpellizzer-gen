    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. plena, commonly known as the Japanese rice flower or the full-flowered rice, is a variant of rice characterized by its ornamental, rather than culinary, use. This plant is native to Asia and is cultivated for its showy, plump grains that resemble small, rounded flowers. The inflorescences are densely packed and often display a striking white or pinkish hue, making it a popular ornamental plant. Unlike typical rice varieties, it does not produce edible grain but is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and floral arrangements. Its botanical features include a slender stem, lanceolate leaves, and a compact panicle structure."
