    "intro": "Ouratella, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds. Ouratella is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
