    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria subsp. lasiostachya, commonly known as the sand vetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive, finely divided leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in dune ecosystems. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in harsh habitats."
