    "intro": "Oberonia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's orchid, is a rare and delicate epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base. The plant produces fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence, often appearing during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oberonia ledermannii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
