    "intro": "Orthiopteris trichophylla, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The hairy shield fern plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem."
