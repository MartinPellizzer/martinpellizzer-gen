    "intro": "Orobanche alsatica subsp. alsatica, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its yellowish or reddish stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like arrangement. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle involves germination dependent on the presence of specific host plants, such as those in the Brassicaceae family."
