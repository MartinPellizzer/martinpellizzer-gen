It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy surface. Orthion veracruzense is primarily found in shaded, moist environments and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure."
