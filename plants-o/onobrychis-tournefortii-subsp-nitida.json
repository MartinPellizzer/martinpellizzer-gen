    "intro": "Onobrychis tournefortii subsp. nitida, commonly known as silky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, elongated pods. Its trifoliate leaves are composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in dry, rocky soils. Silky vetch is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
