    "intro": "Opuntia schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia schomburgkii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and has been used by indigenous peoples for food, medicine, and other practical purposes."
