    "intro": "Orobanche corymbosa subsp. mutabilis, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing members of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its yellowish to reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitats."
