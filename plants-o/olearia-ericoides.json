It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Olearia ericoides is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
