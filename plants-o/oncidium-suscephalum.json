    "intro": "Oncidium suscephalum, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in drier conditions. Its flowers are often arranged in racemes and can last for several weeks, making it a popular choice for ornamental cultivation. Oncidium suscephalum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, with regular watering during the growing season."
