It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that are often adorned with a cinnamon-colored rachis. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
