    "intro": "Oberonia serpentinicaulis, commonly known as the serpentine-stemmed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, serpentine-like stems that coil and twist, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky or serpentine soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a variety of colors ranging from white to pink and purple. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Oberonia serpentinicaulis is considered a rare and endangered species."
