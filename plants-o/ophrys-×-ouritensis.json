    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 ouritensis, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is a herbaceous perennial, typically growing to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a striking display of yellow and brown hues that mimic the appearance of a bee."
