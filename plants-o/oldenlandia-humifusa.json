    "intro": "Oldenlandia humifusa, commonly known as the carpetweed or ground ivy, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are heart-shaped, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often rooting at the nodes. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
