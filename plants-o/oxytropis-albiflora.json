    "intro": "Oxytropis albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria. Oxytropis albiflora is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along riverbanks."
