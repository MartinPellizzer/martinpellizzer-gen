    "intro": "Oxyria rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf oxyria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, usually in late spring. Its botanical features include a short, stout rhizome and a preference for moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Oxyria rotundifolia is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, making it a common indicator species in wetland ecosystems."
