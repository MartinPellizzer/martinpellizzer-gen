It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in response to sunlight. The plant has a succulent stem and leaves, which help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Oxalis solarensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
