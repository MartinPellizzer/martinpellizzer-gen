    "intro": "Onobrychis montana f. hamata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy, and its erect, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
