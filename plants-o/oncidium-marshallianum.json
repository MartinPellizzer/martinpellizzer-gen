    "intro": "Oncidium marshallianum, commonly known as the Marshall's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that typically come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in various environmental conditions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Oncidium marshallianum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
