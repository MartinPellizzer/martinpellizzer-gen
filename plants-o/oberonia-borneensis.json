    "intro": "Oberonia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Oberonia, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with intricate markings that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia borneensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
