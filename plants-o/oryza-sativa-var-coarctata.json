    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rice, is a botanical variant of rice characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact growth habit. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found in wetland or flooded environments. This variety is notable for its small grain size and high yield potential under rice cultivation conditions. Its genetic traits make it a valuable resource for rice breeding programs aimed at improving disease resistance and adaptability. The plant's morphology and physiology are closely linked to its ecological niche, making it an important subject in agricultural and botanical research."
