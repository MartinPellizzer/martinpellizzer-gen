    "intro": "Oxytropis avisoides, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves that resemble a bird's foot. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Oxytropis avisoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
