    "intro": "Opuntia pseudotuna, commonly known as the narrow-leaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pseudotuna is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions."
