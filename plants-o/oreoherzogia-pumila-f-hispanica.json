    "intro": "Oreoherzogia pumila f. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with densely packed, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
