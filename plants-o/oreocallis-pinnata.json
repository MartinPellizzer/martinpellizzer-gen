    "intro": "Oreocallis pinnata, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it its scientific name. Oreocallis pinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
