    "intro": "Oeonia erostris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, yellowish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a common weed in agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth of its host plants."
