    "intro": "Orobanche pelargonii, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless parasitic flowering plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically parasitizing species within the Geraniaceae family. The plant produces showy, often yellow or orange, flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil until a suitable host is available. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and health of its host plants."
