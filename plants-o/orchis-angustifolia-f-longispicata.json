    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. longispicata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid with long spicules, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and its unique floral structure, which features elongated spicules on the column. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
