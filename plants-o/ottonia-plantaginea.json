    "intro": "Ottonia plantaginea, commonly known as the common ottonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features oval, slightly hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white or pale purple flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Ottonia plantaginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where it can thrive in partial shade."
