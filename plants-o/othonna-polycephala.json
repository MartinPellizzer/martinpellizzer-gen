    "intro": "Othonna polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed othonna, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. Othonna polycephala is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
