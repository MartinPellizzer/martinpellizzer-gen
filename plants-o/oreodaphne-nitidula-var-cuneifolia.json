    "intro": "Oreodaphne nitidula var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed oreodaphne, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with branches that are often densely packed. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaf shape and specific geographic distribution."
