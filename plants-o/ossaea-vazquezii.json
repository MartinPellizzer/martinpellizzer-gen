    "intro": "Ossaea vazquezii, commonly known as the Vazquez's ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the arid regions of central Chile. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue flowers that bloom at night, a trait that aids in attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, low-growing structure with narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Ossaea vazquezii thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it highly resilient to drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
