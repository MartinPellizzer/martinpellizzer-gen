    "intro": "Ombrophytum, commonly known as the forest violet, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Violaceae. These plants are typically found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and undergrowth. They possess broad, heart-shaped leaves and produce small, delicate flowers in shades of purple or blue. Ombrophytum species are often characterized by their ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicators of undisturbed, humid forest ecosystems."
