    "intro": "Orithyia biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered orithyia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Orithyia biflora thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
