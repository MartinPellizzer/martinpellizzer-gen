    "intro": "Ophrys cornutula, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a vividly colored lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, orchid-like appearance with intricate patterns. The species is also notable for its role in myrmecophily, as it relies on specific ant species for seed dispersal."
