    "intro": "Ononis angustissima var. glabrescens, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in the southwestern United States. It features slender, ascending stems covered with small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize loose soils in harsh conditions. It is often found in desert scrub and sandy habitats, where it plays a role in preventing soil erosion."
