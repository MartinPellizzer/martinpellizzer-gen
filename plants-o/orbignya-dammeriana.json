    "intro": "Orbignya dammeriana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tall, evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by specific insects, and its fruit is a large, woody capsule containing multiple seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These nuts are rich in nutrients, particularly protein and oils, and are commercially valuable. The Brazil nut tree plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the Amazon, supporting a wide range of wildlife."
