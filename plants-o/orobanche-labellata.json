    "intro": "Orobanche labellata, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host species. The plant produces showy, often colorful flowers that range from white to purple, which can attract pollinators. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural settings. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to crops like cereals and legumes."
