    "intro": "Oncidium panduriferum, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters of yellow and orange hues. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Oncidium panduriferum prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil for optimal growth."
