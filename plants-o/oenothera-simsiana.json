    "intro": "Oenothera simsiana, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has slender, branched stems and linear, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Oenothera simsiana is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
