    "intro": "Odontochilus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive tooth-like markings on the petals. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically growing at elevations above 1,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
