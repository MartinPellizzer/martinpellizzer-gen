    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis basicola, commonly known as the basicule leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring small, lance-shaped leaves and a delicate, greenish-white flower spike. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season, which is crucial for its reproductive cycle. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oreomyrrhis basicola is considered a sensitive indicator of ecological health in its native environment."
