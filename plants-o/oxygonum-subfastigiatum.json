    "intro": "Oxygonum subfastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like inflorescences. Oxygonum subfastigiatum is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
