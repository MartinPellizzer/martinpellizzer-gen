    "intro": "Orchis incarnata f. retusa, commonly known as the pale pink lady's tresses, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, spiraling inflorescence composed of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows, where it thrives in rich, organic soils. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it a distinctive member of the Orchidaceae family. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
