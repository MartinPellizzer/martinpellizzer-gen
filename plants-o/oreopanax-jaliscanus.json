    "intro": "Oreopanax jaliscanus, commonly known as the Jalisco sycamore, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Mexico. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically 15\u201330 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
