    "intro": "Ononis reclinata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Mediterranean climates. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh environments make it a valuable addition to rocky gardens. It is also noted for its role in stabilizing soil in erosion-prone areas."
