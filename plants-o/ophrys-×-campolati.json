    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 campolati, commonly known as the Campolati bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys scolopendra. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, with a labellum that closely resembles a female bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of Italy and Greece. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a spike of flowers with a distinctive, bee-like appearance. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
