    "intro": "Oreocarya alpicola, commonly known as the alpine oreocarya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Oreocarya alpicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
