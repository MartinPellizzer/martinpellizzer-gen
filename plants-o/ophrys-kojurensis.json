    "intro": "Ophrys kojurensis, commonly known as the Kojevnikov's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is adapted to temperate and alpine climates. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ophrys kojurensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
