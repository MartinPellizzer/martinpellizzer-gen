It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which features a prominent lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in temperate climates with well-drained conditions. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and green hues, contributing to its striking visual appearance. Ophrys \u00d7 brunamontei is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
