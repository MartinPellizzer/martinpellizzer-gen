    "intro": "Oryctina quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-angle orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stem and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
