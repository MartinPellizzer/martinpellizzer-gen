    "intro": "Opuntia rosiflora, commonly known as the rose-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems known as cladodes. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Opuntia rosiflora is well adapted to arid environments, with spines that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
