    "intro": "Orostachys fimbriata subvar. limuloides, commonly known as the stone pine or desert groundsel, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of East Asia. It features fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in full sun and poor soil conditions. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
