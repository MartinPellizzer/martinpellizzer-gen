    "intro": "Ornithogalum exscapum var. refractum, commonly known as the fragrant star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of star-shaped, white flowers with a sweet scent. The plant is characterized by its erect, leafless flowering stem that rises above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered invasive in some regions."
