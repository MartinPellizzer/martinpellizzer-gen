    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor subsp. maxima, commonly known as the purple bee orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like floral structure, which plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant features a single, showy flower with a distinctive purple coloration and a specialized labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it a fascinating subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
