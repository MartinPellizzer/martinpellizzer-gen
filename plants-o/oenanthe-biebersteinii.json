    "intro": "Oenanthe biebersteinii, commonly known as the European cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Oenanthe biebersteinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
