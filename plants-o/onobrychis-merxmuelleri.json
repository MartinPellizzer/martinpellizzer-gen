    "intro": "Onobrychis merxmuelleri, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are narrow and often have a silver-white underside. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural settings to improve soil fertility."
