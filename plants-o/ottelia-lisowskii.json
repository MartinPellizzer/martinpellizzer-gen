    "intro": "Ottelia lisowskii, commonly known as the African waterplantain, is a rare aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces oval, dark blue fruits. Ottelia lisowskii is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
