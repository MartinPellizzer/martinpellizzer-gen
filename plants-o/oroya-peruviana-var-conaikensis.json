It is characterized by its striking blue or violet petals and is often found growing in rocky, alpine environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to the cold, high-altitude climate. It produces showy flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
