    "intro": "Ouratea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf ouratea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
