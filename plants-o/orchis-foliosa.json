It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than the stems. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically purple or pink in color, with a distinct lip petal. Orchis foliosa is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
