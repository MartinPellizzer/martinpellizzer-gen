It is characterized by its fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a flavoring agent in teas and confections.
