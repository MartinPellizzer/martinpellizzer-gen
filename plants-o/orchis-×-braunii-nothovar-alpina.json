    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 braunii nothovar. alpina, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a hybrid species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, spurred orchid blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
