    "intro": "Oberonia saintberchmansii, commonly known as the Saint Berchmans' orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in shaded, moist forest understories and requires specific environmental conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
