    "intro": "Opuntia vestita f. maior, commonly known as the giant prickly pear, is a cultivar of the Opuntia genus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flattened stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, covered in dense, spiny margins. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its pads, or cladodes, are succulent and adapted for water storage, a key feature of its arid habitat. The plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience in harsh conditions."
