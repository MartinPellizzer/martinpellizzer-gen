    "intro": "Oreogrammitis scabristipes, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rock fern, is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a rough, textured surface. It is characterized by its unique spore-producing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the leaves."
