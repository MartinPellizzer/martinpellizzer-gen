    "intro": "Onosma echioides var. macrosepalum, commonly known as the large-sepal onosma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers with prominent, showy sepals that are larger than the petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its unique floral structure and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
