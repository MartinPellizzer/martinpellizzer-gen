    "intro": "Oenothera nyctaginiifolia, commonly known as the evening glory, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that open in the evening and close by morning, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant has slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are typically pale purple to white, and they produce small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Oenothera nyctaginiifolia is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
