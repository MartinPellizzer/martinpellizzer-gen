    "intro": "Oenothera deltoides var. cognata, commonly known as the prairie evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats like prairies and sandy soils, and it has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
