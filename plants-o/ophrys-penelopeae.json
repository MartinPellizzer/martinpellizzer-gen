    "intro": "Ophrys penelopeae, commonly known as the Penelope's bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, each with a specialized lip that mimics the appearance and scent of a female bee. Ophrys penelopeae thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
