    "intro": "Oxytropis protopopovii, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in racemes. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which makes it an important component of nutrient-poor ecosystems. However, it is also toxic to livestock due to the presence of alkaloids."
