    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It features a tall, slender rhizome with a cinnamon-colored sheath, giving it its common name. The fronds are bipinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. Sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fertile fronds, and the plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments. This fern is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
