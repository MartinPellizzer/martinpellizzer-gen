    "intro": "Opuntia whitneyana, commonly known as Whitney's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like structures that can cause irritation. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped and covered in a thick, waxy coating. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Opuntia whitneyana plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, due to its nectar and fruit."
