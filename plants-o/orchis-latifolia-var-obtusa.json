    "intro": "Orchis latifolia var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems topped with a dense spike of pale purple to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its specialized orchid structure, including lip-like petals and a columned reproductive organ. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
