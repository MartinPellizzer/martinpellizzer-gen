    "intro": "Osmia frustrata, commonly known as the southern masked bee, is a solitary ground-nesting bee species native to North America. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow coloration. The female constructs its nest in the ground, often in sandy or loose soil, where it lays eggs in hollow stems or plant cavities. Osmia frustrata plays an important role in pollination, particularly for native plants and crops. Its life cycle is closely tied to the availability of specific host plants, making it an indicator species for ecosystem health."
