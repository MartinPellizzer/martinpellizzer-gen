    "intro": "Olgaea eriocephala, commonly known as the woolly bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Olgaea eriocephala is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, coastal or desert climates."
