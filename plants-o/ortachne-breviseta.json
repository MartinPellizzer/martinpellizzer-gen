    "intro": "Ortachne breviseta, commonly known as the short-hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures typical of the grass family. Ortachne breviseta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
