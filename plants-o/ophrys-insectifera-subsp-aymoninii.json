    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subsp. aymoninii, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flower structure, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of bees. The subspecies aymoninii is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species."
