    "intro": "Ornithopodium missus, commonly known as the New Zealand spider-orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid native to New Zealand. It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, wiry stem and small, delicate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, typically with five to seven blooms, each having three petals and three sepals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
