    "intro": "Oxalis promontorii, commonly known as the promontory wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune environments. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Oxalis promontorii is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, contributing to its specialized habitat requirements."
