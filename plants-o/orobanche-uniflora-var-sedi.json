    "intro": "Orobanche uniflora var. sedi, commonly known as the narrow-flowered broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish stems and small, often inconspicuous flowers. This species typically infests plants in the genus Astragalus, commonly found in sandy or disturbed soils. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals from host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to extract nutrients. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
