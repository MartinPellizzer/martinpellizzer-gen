    "intro": "Orchis mascula f. comosa, commonly known as the hairy male orchid, is a botanical variant of the male orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. This plant is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and leaves that are typically broader than those of the typical form. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, with a distinct lip that is often adorned with a tuft of hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant is noted for its subtle fragrance and is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
