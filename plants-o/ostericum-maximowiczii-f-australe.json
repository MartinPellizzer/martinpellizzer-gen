    "intro": "Ostericum maximowiczii f. australe, commonly known as the Australian snowbell, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate ornamental quality to the landscape. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and winter-hardiness make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
