    "intro": "Ochthocharis bullata, commonly known as the bullate lichen, is a foliose lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus with distinct, rounded lobes and a smooth, leathery texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Ochthocharis bullata is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
