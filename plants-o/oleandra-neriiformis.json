    "intro": "Oleandra neriiformis, commonly known as the black-leaf oleander, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and showy clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Oleandra neriiformis is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in full sun. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
