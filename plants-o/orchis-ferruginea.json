    "intro": "Orchis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy leaves and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose raceme and have a spurred lip, a feature common in many orchids. The rusty helleborine is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
