    "intro": "Oxygonum canescens, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Oxygonum canescens is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
