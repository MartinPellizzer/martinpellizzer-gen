It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. Oncodostigma leptoneurum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialty gardens."
