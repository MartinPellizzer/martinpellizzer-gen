    "intro": "Orobanche gussonei, commonly known as the Italian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of Italy and North Africa. The plant produces small, pale yellow or white flowers and has a tubular corolla with five lobes. It typically grows on the roots of other plants, such as those in the legume family, and can be found in dry, disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecosystem dynamics and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
