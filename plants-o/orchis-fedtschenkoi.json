    "intro": "Orchis fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing intricate, lip-shaped petals that attract specific pollinators. Its habitat is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
