    "intro": "Osmia geraniifolia, commonly known as the geranium-leaved mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, dark brown to black body and a distinctive, leaf-like appearance on its leaves, which are actually modified bracts. The plant is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, often in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. Osmia geraniifolia plays an important ecological role in pollination and is valued for its contribution to biodiversity in its native range."
