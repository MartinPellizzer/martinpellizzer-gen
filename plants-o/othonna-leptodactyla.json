It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the winter months, which are often followed by the development of small, bead-like fruits.
