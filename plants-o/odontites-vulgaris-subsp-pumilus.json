    "intro": "Odontites vulgaris subsp. pumilus, commonly known as the small mountain buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with five petals. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and stream banks. Due to its delicate nature, it is sensitive to environmental changes and habitat loss."
