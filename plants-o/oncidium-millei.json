    "intro": "Oncidium millei, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features vibrant, butterfly-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting dark markings. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Oncidium millei thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
