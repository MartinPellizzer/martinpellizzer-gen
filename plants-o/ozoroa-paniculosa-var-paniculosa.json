    "intro": "Ozoroa paniculosa var. paniculosa, commonly known as the paniculate ozoroa, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which are borne on the upper parts of the stems. These flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. It is often found in dry to moist forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
