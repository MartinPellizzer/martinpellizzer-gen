    "intro": "Oxalis filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with slender, thread-like leaflets that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and the subtle beauty of its flowers."
