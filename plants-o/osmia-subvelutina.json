    "intro": "Osmia subvelutina, commonly known as the subvelvet mining bee, is a species of ground-nesting bee native to Europe. It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its slender body and dark, metallic appearance. The female constructs its nest in the ground, often in dry, sunny areas with loose soil. Osmia subvelutina is a solitary bee that plays an important role in pollination, particularly for wildflowers and some fruit crops. Its life cycle involves laying eggs in individual cells provisioned with pollen and nectar."
