    "intro": "Orobanche galii var. ligustri, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, often reddish stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces numerous small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and can parasitize a variety of host plants, including legumes and other herbaceous species. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant ecological and agricultural impacts on its host plants."
