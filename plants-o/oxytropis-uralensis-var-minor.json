    "intro": "Oxytropis uralensis var. minor, commonly known as Siberian locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia and northern regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and alpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
