    "intro": "Orchis maculata f. macroglossa, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking purple and white flowers with distinctive spots, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators, particularly the macroglossum hawk-moth. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in many regions."
