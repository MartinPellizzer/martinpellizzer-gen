    "intro": "Orobanche tunetana var. tacassea, commonly known as the Tunisian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reduced, leafless stems and showy, often yellow or orange flowers. This species typically parasitizes members of the Fabaceae family, such as vetches and clovers, in arid and semi-arid regions. Its life cycle is closely tied to the germination of its host, with seeds remaining dormant in the soil until triggered by chemical signals from the host roots. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
