    "intro": "Ophioglossum reticulatum f. complicatum, commonly known as the complex-stem basket fern, is a rare and unusual fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a short, thick rhizome from which a single, spiral-arranged frond emerges. The frond is typically divided into segments with a complex, lace-like pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to tropical regions and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
