    "intro": "Orania grandiflora, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Orania grandiflora is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
