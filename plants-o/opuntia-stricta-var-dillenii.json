    "intro": "Opuntia stricta var. dillenii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, which are covered in spines and glochids, making it both distinctive and potentially hazardous to handle. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently, adapting well to harsh desert conditions."
