    "intro": "Ophioglossum lusitanicum var. gracillimum, commonly known as the slender adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups of three. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
