    "intro": "Oreocarya leucophaea, commonly known as the whiteleaf stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months, typically blooming in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
