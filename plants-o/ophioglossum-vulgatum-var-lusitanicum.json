    "intro": "Ophioglossum vulgatum var. lusitanicum, commonly known as the Lusitanian adder's tongue, is a perennial fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf, known as a sporophyll, which is typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces a single, erect spore-bearing structure called a sporangium, which is located at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
