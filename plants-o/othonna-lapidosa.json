    "intro": "Othonna lapidosa, commonly known as the stone plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dense clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are often grayish-blue in color. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Othonna lapidosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
