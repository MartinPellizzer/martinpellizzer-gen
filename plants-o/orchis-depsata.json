    "intro": "Orchis depsata, commonly known as the early purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces tall, erect stems that bear a cluster of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it has a complex relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Orchis depsata is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a symbol of natural beauty in botanical gardens."
