    "intro": "Ozothamnus ericeteus, commonly known as the coast wallaby-jack, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal regions, characterized by its dense, compact form and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Ozothamnus ericeteus is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heaths. Its resilience to salt spray and wind makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
