    "intro": "Ornitrophe mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius birdflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its striking, bird-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
