    "intro": "Ononis repens var. brachystachya, commonly known as the short-stalked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. This variety is closely related to other Ononis species but is distinguished by its shorter floral stalks and compact growth form."
