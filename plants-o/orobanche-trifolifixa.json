    "intro": "Orobanche trifolifixa, commonly known as the three-leaved broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers, which are typically short-lived and attract specific pollinators. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grassland and disturbed habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and health of its host plants."
