It features slender, often pendulous stems and produces clusters of fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, yellow, and orange. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining potting mix to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
