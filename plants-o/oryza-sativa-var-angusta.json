    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rice, is a lesser-known variant of the rice species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and smaller grains compared to the more common indica and japonica varieties. This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is adapted to specific environmental conditions. It has been studied for its potential in genetic research due to its unique traits. However, it is not widely cultivated for commercial rice production."
