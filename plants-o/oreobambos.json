    "intro": "Oreobambos, commonly known as the mountain bamboo, is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both grasses and bamboos. It is native to the high Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant has a clumping growth habit, with slender, hollow stems that resemble bamboo but are more robust than typical grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hairs to protect against harsh weather conditions. Oreobambos plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
