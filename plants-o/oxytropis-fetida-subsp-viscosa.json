    "intro": "Oxytropis fetida subsp. viscosa, commonly known as sticky locoweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its sticky hairs and toxic alkaloids make it a defensive trait against herbivores."
