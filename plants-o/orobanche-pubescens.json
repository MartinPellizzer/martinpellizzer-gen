    "intro": "Orobanche pubescens, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on host roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be a problematic weed in agricultural settings. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, making it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
