This variety is native to Southeast Asia and is cultivated for its rich nutritional content, including high levels of antioxidants and minerals. The dark coloration is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which are pigments responsible for the deep hue.

It is a staple in many Asian cuisines and is gaining popularity worldwide for its health benefits."
