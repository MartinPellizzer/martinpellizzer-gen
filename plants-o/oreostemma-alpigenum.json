    "intro": "Oreostemma alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Oreostemma alpigenum is a perennial herb that plays a role in the ecological balance of its alpine ecosystems."
