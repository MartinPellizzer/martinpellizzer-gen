    "intro": "Oncidium sylvestre, commonly known as the wild orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Oncidium sylvestre is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its long-lasting blooms."
