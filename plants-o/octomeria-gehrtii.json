    "intro": "Octomeria gehrtii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as a low shrub with thick, waxy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Its fruits are small berries that mature to a deep red color, often containing seeds that are dispersed by animals. Octomeria gehrtii plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly nocturnal pollinators and seed-dispersing animals."
