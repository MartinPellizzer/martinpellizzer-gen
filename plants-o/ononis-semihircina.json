    "intro": "Ononis semihircina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early spring. Ononis semihircina is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
