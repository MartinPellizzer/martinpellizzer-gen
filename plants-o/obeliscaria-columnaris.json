    "intro": "Obeliscaria columnaris, commonly known as the columnar saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features dense, upright clusters of small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
