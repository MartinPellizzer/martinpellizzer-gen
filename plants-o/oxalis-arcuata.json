    "intro": "Oxalis arcuata, commonly known as the weeping forest oxalis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant features trifoliate leaves with reddish veins and produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and white. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Oxalis arcuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
