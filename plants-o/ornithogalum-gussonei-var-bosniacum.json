    "intro": "Ornithogalum gussonei var. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian star-of-Bethlem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the spring. The plant is characterized by its bulbous root system, which is typical of the Liliaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
