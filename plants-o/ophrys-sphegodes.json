    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its striking flower structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually a mix of brown, yellow, and white, with a distinctive hairy lip that mimics the appearance of a bee's abdomen. Ophrys sphegodes is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming in late spring to early summer."
