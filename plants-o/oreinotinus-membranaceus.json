    "intro": "Oreinotinus membranaceus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has thin, delicate leaves and produces showy, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and is often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as an endangered species."
