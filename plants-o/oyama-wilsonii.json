    "intro": "Oyama wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's mountain yew, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of Japan. It belongs to the family Taxaceae, which includes yews and related coniferous plants. The plant is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oyama wilsonii is considered a vulnerable species."
