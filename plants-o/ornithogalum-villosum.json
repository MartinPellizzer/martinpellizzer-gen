    "intro": "Ornithogalum villosum, commonly known as the woolly star-of-Bethleham, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, stocky stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its underground bulb is an important storage organ that allows it to survive dry periods. Ornithogalum villosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats."
