    "intro": "Orchis coriophora subsp. cimicina, commonly known as the Cimicin orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or alpine meadows. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a unique reproductive strategy involving mycorrhizal associations. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
