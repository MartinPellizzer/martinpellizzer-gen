It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features slender, often hairy stems that are often prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ononis inermis is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
