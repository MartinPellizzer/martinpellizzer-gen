    "intro": "Obione rhagodioides, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody, aromatic bark. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has smooth, reddish-brown bark that exudes a fragrant resin. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, while the fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
