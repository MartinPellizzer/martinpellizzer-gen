    "intro": "Ophrys limbata, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grasslands and heathlands. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. Its flowers are typically yellow with a dark brown or black marking that resembles a bee's face. Ophrys limbata thrives in well-drained soils and is known for its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
