    "intro": "Orobanche laurina, commonly known as the laurel dodder, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange stems and small, scale-like leaves. This species typically parasitizes members of the Lauraceae family, such as laurel and cinnamon trees. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. Orobanche laurina is often found in forested areas and is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range."
