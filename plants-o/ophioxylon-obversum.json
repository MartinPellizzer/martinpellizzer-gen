    "intro": "Ophioxylon obversum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and woody plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
