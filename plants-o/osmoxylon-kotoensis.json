    "intro": "Osmoxylon kotoensis, commonly known as the Koto sandalwood, is a rare tropical tree native to the island of Koto in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its unique scent and durability. The plant typically grows in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, Osmoxylon kotoensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
