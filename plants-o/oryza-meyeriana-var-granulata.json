    "intro": "Oryza meyeriana var. granulata, commonly known as the granulated ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely textured, granular leaves and slender, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, making it well adapted to aquatic environments. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that bear small, rice-like grains, which are used for propagation. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
