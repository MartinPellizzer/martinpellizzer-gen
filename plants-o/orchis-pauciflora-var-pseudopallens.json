    "intro": "Orchis pauciflora var. pseudopallens, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodlands and meadows, preferring partial shade. Its flowers have a unique structure with three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals often resembling lips. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
