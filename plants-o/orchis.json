    "intro": "Orchis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that resemble bees, a feature that aids in pollination by attracting pollinators. Orchis species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Their flowers usually have three petals, with the lower one often modified into a lip or hood. The genus includes over 500 species, many of which are native to Europe, Asia, and North America."
