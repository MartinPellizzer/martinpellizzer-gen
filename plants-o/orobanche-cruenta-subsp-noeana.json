    "intro": "Orobanche cruenta subsp. noeana, commonly known as the red witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple. This species typically parasitizes members of the legume family, such as Vicia and Astragalus, and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it establishes a haustorium to tap into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
