    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's twayblade, is a hybrid orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several European countries."
