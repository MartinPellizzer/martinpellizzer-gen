    "intro": "Orchis romana subsp. georgica, commonly known as the Georgian twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a perennial herb with a slender, leafless stem that bears two opposite leaves near the base. The plant produces a single, showy spike of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose cluster. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine and birch forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
