    "intro": "Ophioglossum wightii, commonly known as the Indian adder's tongue, is a unique fern belonging to the family Ophioglossaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tongue-shaped spore-bearing leaf, known as a sporophyll, which is typically shorter than the sterile leaf. The plant is native to the Indian subcontinent and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with spores produced on the underside of the sporophyll. Ophioglossum wightii is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage and limited distribution."
