    "intro": "Ophioglossum unifolium, commonly known as the adder's tongue fern, is a rare and ancient fern species characterized by its unique morphology. It features a single, elongated leaf that emerges from a rhizome, with a distinctive spore-producing structure called a sporangium. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a very limited distribution, often restricted to specific microhabitats, which contributes to its rarity. Due to its ecological significance and conservation status, it is considered a flagship species for studying plant evolution and biodiversity."
