It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries. Its stems are often woody and can become quite long as it climbs trees or other structures. Oreopanax reticulatus is valued in traditional medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
