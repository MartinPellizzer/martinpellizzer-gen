    "intro": "Olea europaea var. serotina, commonly known as the late leafing olive, is a variety of the olive tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delayed leafing, which typically occurs later in the growing season compared to other olive varieties. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, round olives that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in both ornamental landscaping and for its fruit, which can be used in culinary and medicinal applications."
