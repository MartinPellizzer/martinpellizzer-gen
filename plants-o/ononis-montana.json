    "intro": "Ononis montana, commonly known as mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often blue-green leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these specialized environments. Ononis montana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and prolonged flowering period."
