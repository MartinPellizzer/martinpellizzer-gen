    "intro": "Ottonia striaticaulis, commonly known as the striped stem orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems that are covered in a distinctive reddish-brown, striated pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a faintly colored lip. Native to the high altitudes of Central and South America, it thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ottonia striaticaulis is considered a vulnerable species."
