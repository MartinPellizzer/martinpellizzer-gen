    "intro": "Odontarrhena lurensis, commonly known as the African mountain bamboo, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a fibrous texture, making it suitable for traditional uses. Odontarrhena lurensis is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
