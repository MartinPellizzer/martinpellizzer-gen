It is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that bloom in clusters, often displaying a combination of red, yellow, and orange hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its natural habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The orchid's floral structure is complex, featuring specialized pollination mechanisms that attract specific insect pollinators."
