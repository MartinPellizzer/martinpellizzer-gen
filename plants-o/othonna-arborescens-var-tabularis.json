It features thick, fleshy stems and large, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
