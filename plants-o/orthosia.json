    "intro": "Orthosia, commonly known as the \"wild thyme\" or \"orthosia grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants typically have slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Orthosia species are often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
