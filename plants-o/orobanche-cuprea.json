    "intro": "Orobanche cuprea, commonly known as the red broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its reddish stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically attaches to the roots of host species such as legumes and other herbaceous plants. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by its host. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
