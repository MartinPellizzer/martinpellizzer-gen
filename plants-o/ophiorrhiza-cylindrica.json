    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. Ophiorrhiza cylindrica thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in coastal areas and mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
