    "intro": "Osbeckia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf willow or small willow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Osbeckia pusilla thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is a food source for certain insects."
