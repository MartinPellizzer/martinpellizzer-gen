    "intro": "Orchis undulata, commonly known as the wavy orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are linear and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. Orchis undulata is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species."
