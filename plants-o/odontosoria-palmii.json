    "intro": "Odontosoria palmii, commonly known as the palm fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender, and often branched fronds that resemble a palm tree, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. Odontosoria palmii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
