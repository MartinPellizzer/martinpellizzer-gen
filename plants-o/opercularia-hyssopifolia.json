    "intro": "Opercularia hyssopifolia, commonly known as the hairy opercularia, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
