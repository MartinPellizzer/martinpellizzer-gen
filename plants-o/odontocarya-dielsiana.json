    "intro": "Odontocarya dielsiana, commonly known as the Diels' odontocarya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Mexico and Guatemala. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical collections."
