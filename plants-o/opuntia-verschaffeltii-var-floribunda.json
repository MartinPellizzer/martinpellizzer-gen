    "intro": "Opuntia verschaffeltii var. floribunda, commonly known as the Natal prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to southern Africa. It features flat, fleshy stems that are typically green to blue-green in color, covered in small spines and glochids. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
