    "intro": "Opuntia elongata var. laevior, commonly known as the smooth prickly pear, is a succulent cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are smooth and slightly flattened, with a gray-green coloration. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
