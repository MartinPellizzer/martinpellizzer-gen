    "intro": "Oncinotis thyrsiflora, commonly known as the prairie verbena, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and dry woodlands. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Oncinotis thyrsiflora plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining native plant communities."
