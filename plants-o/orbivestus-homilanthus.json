    "intro": "Orbivestus homilanthus, commonly known as the sacred orchid of the Andes, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that often display vibrant hues of purple and white, with a unique, helmet-shaped lip. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its growth is typically slow, and it is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in its native habitat."
