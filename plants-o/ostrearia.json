    "intro": "Ostrearia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and spiny leaves, which are adapted to coastal environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Ostrearia species are often found in temperate regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and along the coasts of southern Europe and North Africa. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important part of coastal flora."
