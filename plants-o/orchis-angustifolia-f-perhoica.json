    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. perhoica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale violet flowers. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is typically found in moist, calcareous habitats such as woodland edges and meadows. The plant exhibits a unique mycorrhizal relationship with specific fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake and survival. Its limited distribution and habitat specificity make it a subject of interest for conservation biologists. Due to its rarity, it is often protected under various conservation laws to prevent further decline."
