    "intro": "Orobanche californica, commonly known as the California broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of various species in the evening primrose family. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a common sight in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in ecological interactions within its native range."
