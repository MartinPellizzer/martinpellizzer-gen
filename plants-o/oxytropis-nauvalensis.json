    "intro": "Oxytropis nauvalensis, commonly known as the Nauval's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pea-like flowers and nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. Its yellow to orange flowers appear in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis nauvalensis is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
