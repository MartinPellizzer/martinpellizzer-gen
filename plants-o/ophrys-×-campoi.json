    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 campoi, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is a natural hybrid resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, two species known for their mimicry of female wasps. The plant is characterized by its striking, wasp-like flowers that serve as a pollination mechanism through sexual deception. Its habitat typically includes meadows and grasslands in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
