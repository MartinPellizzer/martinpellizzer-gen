It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae and is known for its distinctive, spiral-shaped fronds that curl around supporting structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind. Ophiobostryx volubilis is considered a primitive fern, showcasing features that provide insights into early plant evolution."
