    "intro": "Orchis herbiola, commonly known as the lesser orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a slender, hairy stem that can reach up to 40 cm in height, bearing a single spike of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. The orchid is known for its specialized pollination mechanism, relying on specific insect species for reproduction."
