    "intro": "Opuntia lagopus, commonly known as the snowball cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, globular stems that are often covered in dense clusters of white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia lagopus is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a distinctive and resilient member of the cactus family."
