    "intro": "Oreodaphne leucoxylon var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated ironwood, is a variant of the ironwood tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood with a dark, almost blackish hue, which makes it highly valued for construction and carving. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical fruits containing a single seed. This species is often found in lowland rainforests and thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil."
