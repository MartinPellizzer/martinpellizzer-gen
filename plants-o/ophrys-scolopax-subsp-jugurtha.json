    "intro": "Ophrys scolopax subsp. jugurtha, commonly known as the green bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female wasp, a trait evolved to facilitate pollination by male wasps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are greenish-yellow in color, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. The subspecies is notable for its specialized pollination mechanism and is often found in areas with well-drained soil."
