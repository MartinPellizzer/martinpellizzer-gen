    "intro": "Oxalis pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with heart-shaped leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its foliage resembles that of true sorrel, though it is not related to the edible sorrel species. Oxalis pearsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
