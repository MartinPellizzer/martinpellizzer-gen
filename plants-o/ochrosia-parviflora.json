It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five petals and five sepals, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. Ochrosia parviflora is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in tropical and subtropical climates."
