    "intro": "Oziroe pomensis, commonly known as the giant starflower, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family native to the Canary Islands. This plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, creating a dramatic visual impact in its natural habitat. It thrives in coastal areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often growing on rocky slopes or cliffs. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Oziroe pomensis is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
