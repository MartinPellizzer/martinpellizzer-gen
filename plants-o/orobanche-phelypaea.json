    "intro": "Orobanche phelypaea, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a rootless hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and typically parasitizes plants in the legume family, such as vetches and clovers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with a distinctive bilaterally symmetrical shape. It is found in various habitats across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often in disturbed soils or agricultural fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants."
