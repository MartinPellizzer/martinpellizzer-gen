    "intro": "Opuntia corrugata subsp. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in small, short spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
