    "intro": "Oosterdyckia purpurea, commonly known as the purple marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple or pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The orchid's reproductive strategy involves specialized pollination mechanisms, often relying on specific insect pollinators."
