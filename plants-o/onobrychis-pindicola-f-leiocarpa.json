    "intro": "Onobrychis pindicola f. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded bursaria, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, clustered pods that mature to a smooth, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Its trifoliate leaves are often hairy, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
