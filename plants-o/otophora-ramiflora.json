    "intro": "Otophora ramiflora, commonly known as the branching-leaf orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central America. It features long, slender stems with numerous small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, often clustered in branched inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air and decaying organic matter in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Otophora ramiflora is considered a sensitive indicator species of undisturbed tropical ecosystems."
