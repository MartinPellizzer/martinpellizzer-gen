It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
