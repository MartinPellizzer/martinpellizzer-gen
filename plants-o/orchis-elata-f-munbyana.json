    "intro": "Orchis elata f. munbyana, commonly known as the Munby's tall orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike with three to five flowers, each featuring a unique combination of sepals and petals. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
