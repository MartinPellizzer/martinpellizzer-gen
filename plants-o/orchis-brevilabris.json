    "intro": "Orchis brevilabris, commonly known as the short-lipped orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Orchis brevilabris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
