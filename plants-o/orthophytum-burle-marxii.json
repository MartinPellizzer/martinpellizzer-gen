    "intro": "Orthophytum burle-marxii, commonly known as the Burle Marx cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a low-growing, succulent plant characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming a rounded or cushion-like shape. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
