    "intro": "Orchis chusua var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf early purple orchid, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with a rosette of basal leaves and a single, upright flowering stem. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a loose raceme. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its compact size and is often found in moist, calcareous soils."
