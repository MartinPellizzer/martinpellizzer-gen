    "intro": "Orobanche pubescens var. divaricata, commonly known as the hairy broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow or reddish-brown stem and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. It is found in regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often associated with host species like legumes and grasses. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on the growth and yield of its host plants."
