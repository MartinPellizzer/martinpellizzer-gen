    "intro": "Ornithogalum parvum, commonly known as the little owl's milk or the dwarf star of Bethlehem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates. The bulbs can be divided and planted in the fall for propagation."
