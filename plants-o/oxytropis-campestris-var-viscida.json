It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with a sticky surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its sticky foliage helps it retain moisture and deter herbivores."
