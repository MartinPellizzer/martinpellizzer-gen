    "intro": "Ornithopus sativus f. hebecarpus, commonly known as the slender caraway, is a variant of the annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that are typically hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, hairy seed pods. Its botanical characteristics make it distinguishable from the typical form of Ornithopus sativus. This form is often cultivated for its aromatic seeds, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
