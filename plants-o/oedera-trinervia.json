    "intro": "Oedera trinervia, commonly known as the three-veined oedera, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and small, pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, each with a distinct central vein. Oedera trinervia is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments."
