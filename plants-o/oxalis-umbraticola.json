    "intro": "Oxalis umbraticola, commonly known as the shadowy wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant native to the understory of shaded forests in South America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its delicate, five-petaled flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. Oxalis umbraticola is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
