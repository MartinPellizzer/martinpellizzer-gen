    "intro": "Oryza minuta, commonly known as dwarf rice, is a small grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact stature and small, clustered spikelets. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are minute and arranged in dense inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family. Oryza minuta is often found in wetland habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
