    "intro": "Orthoclada, commonly known as the green alga, is a genus of freshwater green algae belonging to the order Cladophorales. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, with cells arranged in a branching, ribbon-like pattern. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead consists of a thallus composed of interlocking cells. Orthoclada species are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems as a primary producer and a food source for various aquatic organisms."
