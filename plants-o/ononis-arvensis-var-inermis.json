    "intro": "Ononis arvensis var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are alternate, oblong, and slightly hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Small, white to pale yellow flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
