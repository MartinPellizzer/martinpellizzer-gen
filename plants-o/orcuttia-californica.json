    "intro": "Orcuttia californica, commonly known as the San Diego cordgrass, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southern California. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy soils along the coastline. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is adapted to the harsh coastal environment, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Orcuttia californica is also known for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
