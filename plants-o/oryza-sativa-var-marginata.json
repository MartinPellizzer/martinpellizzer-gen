    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. marginata, commonly known as the marginal rice or marginated rice, is a variant of the common rice species native to Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and panicles that often exhibit a distinctive marginal coloration. This variety is typically cultivated in wetland environments and is adapted to thrive in flooded conditions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a branched inflorescence. The plant's grains are smaller compared to standard rice varieties, making it a unique subject of study in agricultural botany."
