    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 apicula, commonly known as the bee orchid hybrid, is a fascinating plant in the Ophrys genus, known for its intricate mimicry of female bees. It is a natural hybrid between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera, resulting in a unique combination of floral traits. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers that serve as a pollination mechanism by attracting male bees. Its botanical features include a tall, erect stem with a single spike of flowers, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats across Europe."
