    "intro": "Ophrys phaseliana, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe, particularly Greece and Turkey. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex, lip-like petal that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to orange in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys phaseliana is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats that support its specialized ecological requirements."
