    "intro": "Oncidium cariniferum, commonly known as the feathered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, arching inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and green. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are strap-like and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Oncidium cariniferum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
