    "intro": "Orchis provincialis var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare provincial orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, favoring rich, loamy soils. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces a single, erect stem with a few lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
