    "intro": "Opuntia megliolii, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible fruit known as tunas. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Opuntia megliolii is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of food and fiber."
