    "intro": "Onobrychis hamata, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soils and makes it useful for soil stabilization. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Onobrychis hamata is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
