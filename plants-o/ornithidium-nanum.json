    "intro": "Ornithidium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it has a short flowering period. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
