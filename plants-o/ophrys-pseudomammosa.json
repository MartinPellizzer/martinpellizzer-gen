    "intro": "Ophrys pseudomammosa, commonly known as the false mammoth orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. Ophrys pseudomammosa is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, often blooming in late spring or early summer."
