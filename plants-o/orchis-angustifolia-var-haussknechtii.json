    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a short rhizome and produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
