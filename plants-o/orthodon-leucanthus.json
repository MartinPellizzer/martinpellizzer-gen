    "intro": "Orthodon leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered orthodon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
