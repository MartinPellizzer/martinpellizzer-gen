    "intro": "Ophrys pseudospeculum var. araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, which mimics the appearance of a spider, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with intricate patterns and a specialized structure called a labellum, which attracts male bees through visual and chemical cues. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this species is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
