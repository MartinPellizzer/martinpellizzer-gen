    "intro": "Oryzopsis humilis, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairless stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers and has narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. Oryzopsis humilis thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
