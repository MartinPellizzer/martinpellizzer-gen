It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems, known as cladodes, which are covered in spines and glochids. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia maidenii is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food."
