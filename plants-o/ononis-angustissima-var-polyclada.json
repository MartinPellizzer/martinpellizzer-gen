    "intro": "Ononis angustissima var. polyclada, commonly known as narrowleaf whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features slender, ascending stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
