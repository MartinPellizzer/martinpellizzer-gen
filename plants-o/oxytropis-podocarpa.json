    "intro": "Oxytropis podocarpa, commonly known as the desert locoweed, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically compound, consisting of several small leaflets. Oxytropis podocarpa plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen into the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
