    "intro": "Orchis sambucina f. hungarica, commonly known as the Hungarian orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a yellow lip. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It has a tall, unbranched stem with a single spike of flowers, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
