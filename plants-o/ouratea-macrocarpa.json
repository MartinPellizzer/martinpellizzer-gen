    "intro": "Ouratea macrocarpa, commonly known as the Brazilian holly or large-fruited ouratea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ochnaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, fleshy, red berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
