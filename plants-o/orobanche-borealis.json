    "intro": "Orobanche borealis, commonly known as the northern broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It is found in arctic and alpine regions, where it attaches to the roots of other plants through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is not commonly cultivated and is more often encountered in its natural habitat. Its presence can indicate specific environmental conditions, making it a subject of interest in ecological studies."
