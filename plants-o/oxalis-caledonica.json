    "intro": "Oxalis caledonica, commonly known as the Caledonian wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Scotland and northern England. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open when mature. Oxalis caledonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
