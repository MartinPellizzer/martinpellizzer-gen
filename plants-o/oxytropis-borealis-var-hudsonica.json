    "intro": "Oxytropis borealis var. hudsonica, commonly known as Hudson's bluebottle, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, cold environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in tundra ecosystems and is often found in open, rocky habitats. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh climatic conditions."
