    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 apollinaris, commonly known as the Apollinaris orchid, is a natural hybrid between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, particularly found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces tall, slender stems with a single spike of flowers that range from pink to purple in color. Its flowers have a distinct three-lobed structure typical of many orchid species, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. The Apollinaris orchid is often associated with damp habitats and is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
