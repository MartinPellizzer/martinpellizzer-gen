    "intro": "Orthaea pinnatinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined orthaea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with finely pinnate venation, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
