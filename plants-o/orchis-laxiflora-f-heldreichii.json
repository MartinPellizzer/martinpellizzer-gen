    "intro": "Orchis laxiflora f. heldreichii, commonly known as the Heldreich's looseflower orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate, dark green leaves. The flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
