    "intro": "Oxycedrus withmanniana, commonly known as the Withmann's cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
