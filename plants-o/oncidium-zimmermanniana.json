    "intro": "Oncidium zimmermanniana, commonly known as the Yellow Lady's Slipper, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It features showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive yellow pouch-like lip, which is a key feature in attracting pollinators. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium zimmermanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
