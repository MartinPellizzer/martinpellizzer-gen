    "intro": "Oxytropis khorasanica, commonly known as Persian locoweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early summer. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by livestock and considered a weed in agricultural areas."
