    "intro": "Oerstedella pseudowallisii, commonly known as the Wallisii's Oerstedella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. Native to specific regions in South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical features include a taproot system and aromatic foliage, which are typical of many members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
