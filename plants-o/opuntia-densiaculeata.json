    "intro": "Opuntia densiaculeata, commonly known as the dense-spined prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia densiaculeata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
