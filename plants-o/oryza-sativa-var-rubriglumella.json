This variety is primarily cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The botanical features include long, slender grains with a high amylose content, contributing to its firm texture when cooked. It is typically grown in flooded fields, requiring a significant amount of water during its growth cycle. The plant has a short stature with a robust root system, allowing it to withstand periodic submergence."
