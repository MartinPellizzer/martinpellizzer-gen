    "intro": "Ophrys mammosa subsp. janrenzii, commonly known as the Janrenz's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive pouch-like structure at the base, known as the labellum. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
