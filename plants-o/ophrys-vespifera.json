    "intro": "Ophrys vespifera, commonly known as the wasp orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, wasp-like appearance, with a yellow face and brown markings that mimic the appearance of a wasp. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm and produces a single, erect flower with a distinctive lip. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The orchid is pollinated by wasps, which are deceived into attempting to mate with the flower, a strategy that ensures effective pollination."
