    "intro": "Opuntia matudae, commonly known as the Matudas prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible fruits that are typically pear-shaped. Opuntia matudae is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its thick, succulent stems. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in its native region."
