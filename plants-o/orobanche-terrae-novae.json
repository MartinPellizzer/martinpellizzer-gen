    "intro": "Orobanche terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundlander mistletoe, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically attaches to the stems of various shrubs and trees, forming a symbiotic relationship that can weaken the host plant. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and is native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas along the Atlantic coast. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
