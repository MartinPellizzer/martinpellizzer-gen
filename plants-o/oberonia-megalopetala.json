    "intro": "Oberonia megalopetala, commonly known as the giant petal orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, featuring a vibrant mix of pink and white hues. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help retain moisture. Due to its beauty and rarity, Oberonia megalopetala is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
