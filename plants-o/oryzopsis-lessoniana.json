    "intro": "Oryzopsis lessoniana, commonly known as the slender panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions by accessing deep water sources. Oryzopsis lessoniana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
