    "intro": "Oedematopus dodecandrus, commonly known as the twelve-flowered bladder grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, inflated seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and coastal areas. Its unique morphology, including the swollen, bladder-like structures on its stems, is a key feature for identification. Oedematopus dodecandrus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
