    "intro": "Ottonia propinqua, commonly known as the lesser false nettle, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its stinging hairs, similar to those found in true nettles, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. Ottonia propinqua is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate regions."
