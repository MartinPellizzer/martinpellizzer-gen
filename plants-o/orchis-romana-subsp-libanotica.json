    "intro": "Orchis romana subsp. libanotica, commonly known as the Libanotica Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its pollination is primarily carried out by specific bee species, which are attracted to its nectar-rich flowers. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
