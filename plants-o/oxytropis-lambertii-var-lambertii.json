It is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its toxicity to livestock, it is often considered a weed in grazing areas."
