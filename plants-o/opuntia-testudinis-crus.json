It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in sharp spines and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits known as tunas, which are rich in nutrients. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh desert conditions."
