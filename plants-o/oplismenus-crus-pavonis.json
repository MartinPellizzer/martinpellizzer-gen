    "intro": "Oplismenus crus-pavonis, commonly known as the common wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, shaded environments. Oplismenus crus-pavonis is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
