    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf marsh bean, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its slender, often pendulous stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, adapting to waterlogged soils with its specialized root system. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Ophiorrhiza dolichophylla plays a role in stabilizing coastal and swamp ecosystems due to its extensive root network."
