    "intro": "Oberonia merapiensis, commonly known as the Merapi orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively on the slopes of Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense tropical rainforest canopy. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Oberonia merapiensis is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation interest."
