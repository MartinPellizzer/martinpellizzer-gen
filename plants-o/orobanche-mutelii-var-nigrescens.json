    "intro": "Orobanche mutelii var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nourishment. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and agricultural fields. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host species, primarily those in the Fabaceae family. Due to its parasitic nature and lack of leaves, it plays a unique ecological role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
