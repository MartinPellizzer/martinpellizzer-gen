    "intro": "Oparanthus teikiteetinii, commonly known as the Kauai ironwood, is a rare shrub native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pale green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
