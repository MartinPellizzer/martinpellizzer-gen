    "intro": "Oxytropis kobukensis, commonly known as the Kobuk milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra regions of northern Alaska and Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it has a deep root system adapted to the cold, nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Oxytropis kobukensis plays a role in stabilizing the soil and providing food for local wildlife in its harsh environment."
