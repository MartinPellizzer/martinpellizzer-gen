    "intro": "Orthosia meridensis, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Orthosia meridensis is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access underground water sources."
