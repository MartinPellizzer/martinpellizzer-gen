    "intro": "Opuntia parviclada, commonly known as the small-flowered prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded stems covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Opuntia parviclada is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its structure and growth habits make it a notable species in desert ecosystems."
