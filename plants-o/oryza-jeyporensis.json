    "intro": "Oryza jeyporensis, commonly known as Jeypore rice, is a species of wild rice native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its grains are small and have a distinct aroma, making it a subject of interest for both botanical research and potential agricultural use. Oryza jeyporensis is also valued for its role in traditional ecosystems and its potential contribution to rice biodiversity."
