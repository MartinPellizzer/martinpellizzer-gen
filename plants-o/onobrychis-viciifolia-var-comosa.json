It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a hairy, creeping stem and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and long blooming period."
