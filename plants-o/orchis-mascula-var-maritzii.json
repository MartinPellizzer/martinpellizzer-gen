It is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive yellow-green lip, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in nutrient-rich soils. Its morphology includes erect, leafy stems and is part of the Orchidaceae family, known for its complex floral structures. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
