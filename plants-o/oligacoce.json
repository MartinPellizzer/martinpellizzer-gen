    "intro": "Oligacoce, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a hardy shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Oligacoce is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its durability in landscaping."
