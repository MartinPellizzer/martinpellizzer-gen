    "intro": "Opuntia schweriniana, commonly known as the Schwerin prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stem segments, known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Opuntia schweriniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
