    "intro": "Ophrys quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lip-like flower that mimics the appearance of female wasps, a feature that plays a role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture, and it produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Ophrys quadriloba is primarily found in Europe and is known for its specialized relationship with specific pollinators."
