It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often showy floral structure. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
