    "intro": "Oenanthe phellandrium var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river cowplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in eastern Australia. It features slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a distinctive aromatic scent. It thrives in moist soils and is adapted to flood-prone areas, making it an important component of riparian ecosystems."
