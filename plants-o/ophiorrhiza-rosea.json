    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza rosea, commonly known as the red sandalwood or red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen shrub that thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Ophiorrhiza rosea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
