    "intro": "Osmia picta, commonly known as the painted mason bee, is a solitary bee species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive black body with bright yellow and orange markings, which serve as a warning signal to potential predators. The plant-related aspects of Osmia picta involve its preference for flowering plants that provide abundant nectar and pollen, such as clover, dandelion, and various herbs. These bees are important pollinators, contributing to the reproduction of numerous plant species. Their nesting behavior involves constructing small, mud-based cells where they lay eggs, often in hollow stems or artificial nests."
