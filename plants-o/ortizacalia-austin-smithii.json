    "intro": "Ortizacalia austin-smithii, commonly known as the Austin-Smith's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a blend of white, purple, and pink hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical features include elongated, strap-like leaves and a compact inflorescence with numerous small, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
