    "intro": "Oncidium pectorale var. mantinii, commonly known as the Mantinii Oncidium, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that come in shades of yellow and orange, often with a contrasting red lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical, and it produces multiple flower spikes during the growing season. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements in cultivation."
