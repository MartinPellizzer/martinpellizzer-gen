    "intro": "Odontophyllum cirsioides, commonly known as the common thistleweed, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands and along stream banks. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Odontophyllum cirsioides is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
