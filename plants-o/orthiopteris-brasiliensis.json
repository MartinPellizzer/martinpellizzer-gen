    "intro": "Orthiopteris brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize sediment and improve water quality. The fronds are usually bi-lobed and have a smooth, waxy surface, which aids in its buoyancy and survival in aquatic environments."
