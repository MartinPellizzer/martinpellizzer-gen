    "intro": "Orobanche cathae, commonly known as the pale barrenweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its distinctive, showy flowers. The plant typically produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. It is found in various regions of Europe and is often associated with grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have a significant impact on the growth and health of its host plants."
