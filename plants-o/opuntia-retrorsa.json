    "intro": "Opuntia retrorsa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, spine-tipped pads, which are often ribbed and covered in fine, white hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia retrorsa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
