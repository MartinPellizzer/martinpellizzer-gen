It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment."
