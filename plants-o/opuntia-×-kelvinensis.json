    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 kelvinensis, commonly known as the Kelvin's prickly pear, is a hybrid cactus species native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are typically green and covered in small spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Opuntia \u00d7 kelvinensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
