    "intro": "Olsynium, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a delicate, waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow or orange. Olsynium species are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, and they often thrive in moist, woodland environments. These plants are also known for their edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
