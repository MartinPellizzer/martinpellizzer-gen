    "intro": "Onoclea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that resemble the shape of an oak leaf. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is native to eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, fuzzy texture on the underside. Onoclea quercifolia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
