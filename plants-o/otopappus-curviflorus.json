    "intro": "Otopappus curviflorus, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Otopappus curviflorus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
