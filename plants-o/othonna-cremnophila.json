    "intro": "Othonna cremnophila, commonly known as the rock othonna, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Othonna cremnophila is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
