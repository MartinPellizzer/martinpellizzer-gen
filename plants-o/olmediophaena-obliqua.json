    "intro": "Olmediophaena obliqua, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a slender stem with few leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It blooms in late summer, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
