    "intro": "Onobrychis oxyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burclover, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry and rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal."
