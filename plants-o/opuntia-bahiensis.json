    "intro": "Opuntia bahiensis, commonly known as the Bahia prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the coastal regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems known as cladodes, which are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit, called a tunas, is edible and has a sweet, juicy flavor. Opuntia bahiensis is well adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems and traditional uses."
