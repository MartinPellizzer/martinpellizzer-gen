    "intro": "Orobanche ammophila, commonly known as the sand hopper or sand dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It typically parasitizes grasses and other plants in sandy or disturbed soils, often found in coastal dunes or agricultural fields. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a specialized root system that attaches to the roots of its host. Its life cycle is closely tied to the presence of suitable host plants, making it a challenging species to control. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and productivity of its host plants."
