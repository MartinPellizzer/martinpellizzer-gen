It belongs to the Oxalidaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features prominently veined leaves that resemble those of the common wood sorrel, but on a much larger scale. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom in spring, adding a dramatic visual impact to gardens. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in warm climates as a decorative plant."
