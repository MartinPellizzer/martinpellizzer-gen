It features trifoliate leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and ecological role in soil enrichment."
