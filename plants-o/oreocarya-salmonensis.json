    "intro": "Oreocarya salmonensis, commonly known as the salmon mountain buckwheat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Oreocarya salmonensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
