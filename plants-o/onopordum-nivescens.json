    "intro": "Onopordum nivescens, commonly known as snowdonia thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, silver-white, woolly leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
