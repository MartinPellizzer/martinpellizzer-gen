    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subvar. barringtonensis, commonly known as the Barrington's prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in the dry season. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains seeds that are dispersed by animals. This subvariety is adapted to the arid and coastal environments of the Gal\u00e1pagos, exhibiting unique morphological traits suited to its island habitat."
