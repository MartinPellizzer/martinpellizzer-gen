    "intro": "Oxydectes frionis, commonly known as the Frion's oxydectes, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Oxydectes frionis is considered a species of conservation concern."
