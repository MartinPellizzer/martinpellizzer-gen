    "intro": "Orthosiphon pallidus, commonly known as the pale horse plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Orthosiphon pallidus is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
