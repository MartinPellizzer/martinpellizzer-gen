    "intro": "Orchis coriophora subsp. sancta, commonly known as the Holy Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually clustered in a spike and are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
