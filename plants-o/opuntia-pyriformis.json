    "intro": "Opuntia pyriformis, commonly known as the pear-shaped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, green, fleshy stems that resemble pears, which are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. Opuntia pyriformis is adapted to arid environments and has a shallow root system to efficiently absorb water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
