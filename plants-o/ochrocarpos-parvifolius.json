    "intro": "Ochrocarpos parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved ochrocarpus, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces yellowish to brownish flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the daisy family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
