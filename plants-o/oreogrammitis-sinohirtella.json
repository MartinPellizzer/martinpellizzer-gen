    "intro": "Oreogrammitis sinohirtella, commonly known as the Chinese wall fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in mountainous regions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
