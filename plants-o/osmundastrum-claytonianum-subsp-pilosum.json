    "intro": "Osmundastrum claytonianum subsp. pilosum, commonly known as the silky fern, is a member of the Osmundaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a soft, silky texture due to the dense covering of minute scales. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of ferns. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
