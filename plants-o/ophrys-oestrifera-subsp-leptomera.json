    "intro": "Ophrys oestrifera subsp. leptomera, commonly known as the slender bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are predominantly yellow with a distinctive dark brown or black marking on the lip, aiding in mimicry. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
