    "intro": "Ophrys fuciflora subsp. montiliensis, commonly known as the Montilio orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
