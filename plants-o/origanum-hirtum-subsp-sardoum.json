    "intro": "Origanum hirtum subsp. sardoum, commonly known as Sardinian oregano, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It features aromatic, narrow-lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in carvacrol and thymol, contribute to its strong aromatic profile and medicinal uses."
