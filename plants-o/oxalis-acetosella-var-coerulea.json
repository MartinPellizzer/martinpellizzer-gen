It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive blue or purple hue, which are often adorned with white or pale veins. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, violet or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to form dense mats in woodland gardens."
