    "intro": "Oxalis tenuipes, commonly known as the narrowleaf wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, yellow, or pink. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Oxalis tenuipes is also noted for its ability to tolerate dry conditions once established."
