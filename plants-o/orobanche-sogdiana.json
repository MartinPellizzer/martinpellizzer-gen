    "intro": "Orobanche sogdiana, commonly known as the Sogdian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root connections to host plants. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and yield of its host plants, making it both ecologically and agriculturally significant."
