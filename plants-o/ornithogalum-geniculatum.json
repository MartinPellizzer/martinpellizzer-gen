    "intro": "Ornithogalum geniculatum, commonly known as the bent-stem star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, upright stem that bends at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette. Ornithogalum geniculatum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
