    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. ocellata, commonly known as the spotted bee orchid, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing in dense clusters. The flower has a distinctive yellow and brown pattern with a prominent central spot, resembling an eye. This orchid thrives in specific habitats, often in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil."
