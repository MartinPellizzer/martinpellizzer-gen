    "intro": "Otochilus porrectus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved duck's bill, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and narrow leaves that resemble a duck's bill, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Otochilus porrectus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
