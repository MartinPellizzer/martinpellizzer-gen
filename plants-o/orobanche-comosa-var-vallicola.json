    "intro": "Orobanche comosa var. vallicola, commonly known as the mountain dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its slender, thread-like stems that twist around the stems of its host plants. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in alpine or mountainous habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
