    "intro": "Orobanche sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. It is found in woodland and grassland habitats across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
