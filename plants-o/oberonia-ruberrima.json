    "intro": "Oberonia ruberrima, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and rain, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oberonia ruberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
