It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
