    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna aeoniopsis, commonly known as the starry aeonium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces striking, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
