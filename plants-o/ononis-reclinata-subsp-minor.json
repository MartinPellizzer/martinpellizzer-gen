    "intro": "Ononis reclinata subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, often with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and gravelly slopes. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the main species."
