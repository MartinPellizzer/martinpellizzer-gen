    "intro": "Orostachys minuta, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of East Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal plant for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens."
