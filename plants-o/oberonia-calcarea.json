    "intro": "Oberonia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in calcareous soils, typically found in forest understories with high humidity and filtered light. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to habitat loss, Oberonia calcarea is considered endangered in many regions."
