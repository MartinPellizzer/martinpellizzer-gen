    "intro": "Oberonia rhizophoreti, commonly known as the root-attached orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Due to its delicate nature, it is often overlooked but plays a significant role in its ecosystem."
