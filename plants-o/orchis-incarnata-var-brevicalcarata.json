    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. brevicalcarata, commonly known as the short-spurred purple orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces tall, unbranched stems bearing showy, violet-purple flowers with short, spurred petals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it is often found in association with other orchid species. The variety is distinguished by its shorter spur compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata."
