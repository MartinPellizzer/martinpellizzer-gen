    "intro": "Oreodaphne schottii, commonly known as the Schott's oreodaphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-barked trunk and large, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
