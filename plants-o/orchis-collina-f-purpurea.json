    "intro": "Orchis collina f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple sand-orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heaths or grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the plant produces a single, erect stem bearing several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
