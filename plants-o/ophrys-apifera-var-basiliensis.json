    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. basiliensis, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape that closely resembles a bee, which plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The orchid is a perennial herb, producing a single stem with several flowers that attract male bees through mimicry."
