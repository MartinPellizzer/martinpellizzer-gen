    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. castroi, commonly known as the Castro rice, is a less common variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short stature and relatively small grain size compared to other rice varieties. The plant typically grows in flooded conditions, similar to other rice species, and has a short growing season. It is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to marginal soils. However, it is not as widely cultivated or commercially available as other rice types."
