    "intro": "Osteospermum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid osteospermum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa.

The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has hairy, rigid stems. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments.
