    "intro": "Oenothera punae, commonly known as the Puna evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Oenothera punae is part of the Onagraceae family, known for its diverse array of species adapted to various ecological niches."
