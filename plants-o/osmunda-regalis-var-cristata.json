    "intro": "Osmunda regalis var. cristata, commonly known as the royal fern or the crown fern, is a variant of the royal fern characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that resemble a crown. It is a fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae and is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant features a stout, unbranched rhizome with a single, tall, sterile frond that is typically green and adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands, and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
