    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. phaneroleuca, commonly known as the white rice plant, is a cultivated variety of rice characterized by its distinctive white, non-pigmented grains. It is primarily grown in tropical and subtropical regions for its high yield and grain quality. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and the plant undergoes a complex life cycle involving both vegetative and reproductive phases. Botanically, it is valued for its genetic diversity and role in rice breeding programs."
