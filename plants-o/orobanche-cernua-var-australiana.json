    "intro": "Orobanche cernua var. australiana, commonly known as the Australian common broomrape, is a root-parasitic plant native to Australia. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various grasses and herbs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a spikelike inflorescence, and its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal availability of host plants. It is an annual species, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants in agricultural and natural settings."
