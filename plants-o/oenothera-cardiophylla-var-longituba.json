It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom at night. The plant has slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. This variant is distinguished by its longer stems compared to the typical form of Oenothera cardiophylla."
