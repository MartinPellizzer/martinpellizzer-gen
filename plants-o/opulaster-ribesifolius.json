    "intro": "Opulaster ribesifolius, commonly known as the roughleaf opulaster, is a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Opulaster ribesifolius is a relatively rare and understudied species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
