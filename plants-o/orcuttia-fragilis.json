    "intro": "Orcuttia fragilis, commonly known as the fragile orcuttia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal dunes of southern California. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Orcuttia fragilis is considered endangered and is protected under California's Endangered Species Act. Its conservation is critical for maintaining the ecological balance of its unique habitat."
