    "intro": "Oreoherzogia pumila var. hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish dwarf orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features a compact growth habit with a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, erect, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, small, pale yellow to white flower with a distinctive, narrow lip. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
