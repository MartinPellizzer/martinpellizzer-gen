    "intro": "Oberonia bilobatolabella, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often fragrant flowers that display a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the wet season. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
