    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 ladurneri, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This hybrid is relatively rare and is often found in regions with suitable climatic and soil conditions."
