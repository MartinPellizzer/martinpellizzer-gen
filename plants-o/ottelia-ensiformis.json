    "intro": "Ottelia ensiformis, commonly known as the arrowleaf water plant, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features long, narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, often in clusters. Ottelia ensiformis is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes can spread rapidly, making it both a useful indicator species and a potential invasive plant in certain environments."
