    "intro": "Odina triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being arrowhead-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its stems are often prostrate or trailing. It produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Odina triphylla is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
