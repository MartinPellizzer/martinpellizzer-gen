    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia subf. filiformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and a tall, erect stem that bears a single spike of pale purple or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its flowers are often short-lived, blooming for only a few weeks in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
