    "intro": "Ononis laxiflora var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandspurry, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Ononis laxiflora."
