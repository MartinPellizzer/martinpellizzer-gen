    "intro": "Orygia portulacifolia, commonly known as the desert star, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. Orygia portulacifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements in landscaping."
