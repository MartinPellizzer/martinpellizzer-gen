    "intro": "Oberonia boerlageana, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, intricate flower structure, which features a strikingly colored lip and a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in the dense, humid understory of tropical forests. Its small, clustered flowers are often hidden among the foliage, making it difficult to spot in its natural habitat. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Oberonia boerlageana is considered a critically endangered species."
