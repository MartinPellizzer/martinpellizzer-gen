    "intro": "Oenothera cheradophila, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought, including deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Oenothera cheradophila is also known for its medicinal properties, with its seeds containing oils used in traditional and modern herbal remedies."
