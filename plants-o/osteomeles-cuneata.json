    "intro": "Osteomeles cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are small and red, develop in the fall and are an important food source for birds. Osteomeles cuneata prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks."
