    "intro": "Opuntia exuviata, commonly known as the desert prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often used for ornamental purposes. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by edible fruit known as tunas. Opuntia exuviata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
