    "intro": "Onobrychis macedonica, commonly known as Macedonian burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. It produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
