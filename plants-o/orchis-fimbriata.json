    "intro": "Orchis fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually purple or violet, with distinctive fringed petals and sepals that give it its common name. Orchis fimbriata is often found in moist, calcareous habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
