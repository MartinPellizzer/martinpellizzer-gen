    "intro": "Odontosoria scandens, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with rhizomes that allow it to ascend tree trunks and other structures. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Odontosoria scandens thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and moist woodlands."
