    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. holosericea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces a single, erect flowering stem. The flowers are specialized for mimicry, resembling female bees to attract male pollinators. The orchid has a complex life cycle, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake during its early growth stages. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
