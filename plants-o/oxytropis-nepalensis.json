It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it adapts to cold and arid conditions. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, and the flowers are often pink or purple in color. Oxytropis nepalensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
