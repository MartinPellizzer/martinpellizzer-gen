    "intro": "Oxybasis glauca subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the bluegrass bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-gray leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its scientific name reflects its close relation to other species in the Oxybasis genus. The subspecies ambigua is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the main species."
