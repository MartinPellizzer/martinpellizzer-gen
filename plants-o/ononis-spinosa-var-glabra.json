    "intro": "Ononis spinosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth cat's-paw, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The smooth variety distinguishes itself from other forms by its lack of stem and leaf pubescence."
