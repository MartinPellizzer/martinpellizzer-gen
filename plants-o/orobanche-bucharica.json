    "intro": "Orobanche bucharica, commonly known as the Balkan broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of various flowering plants. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, including the Balkans. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is often considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
