    "intro": "Opuntia parryi, commonly known as Parry's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia parryi is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture efficiently. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
