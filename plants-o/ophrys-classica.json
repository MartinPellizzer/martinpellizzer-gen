    "intro": "Ophrys classica, commonly known as the Greek Orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique flower structure, which resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. Ophrys classica is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
