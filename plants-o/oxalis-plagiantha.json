    "intro": "Oxalis plagiantha, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the common wood sorrel, and its clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is a perennial herb that produces capsule fruits containing several seeds. Oxalis plagiantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
