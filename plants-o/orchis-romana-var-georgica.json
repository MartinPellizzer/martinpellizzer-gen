    "intro": "Orchis romana var. georgica, commonly known as the Georgian lady's tresses, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant flower spikes that bear numerous small, white to pale pink blossoms. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
