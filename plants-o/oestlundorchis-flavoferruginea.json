    "intro": "Oestlundorchis flavoferruginea, commonly known as the golden rust orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with yellowish-orange petals and sepals, and a distinctive, reddish-brown labellum. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
