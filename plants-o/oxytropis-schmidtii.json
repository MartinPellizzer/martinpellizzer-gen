    "intro": "Oxytropis schmidtii, commonly known as Schmidt's locoweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Oxytropis schmidtii is also known for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to livestock."
