It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is noted for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
