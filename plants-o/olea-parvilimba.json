It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Olea parvilimba is often found in dry woodlands and savannas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
