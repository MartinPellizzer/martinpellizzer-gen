    "intro": "Oncostema umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it is often found in disturbed or swampy habitats. Oncostema umbellata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
