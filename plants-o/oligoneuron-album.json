    "intro": "Oligoneuron album, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which are often described as resembling ghostly apparitions. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a single, slender stem that supports a cluster of showy blooms. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of cypress trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
