    "intro": "Orchis maurusia, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with flowers that have three sepals and three petals, one of which is prominently hooded. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Orchis maurusia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
