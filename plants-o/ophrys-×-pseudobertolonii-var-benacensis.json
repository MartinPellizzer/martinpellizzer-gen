    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pseudobertolonii var. benacensis, commonly known as the Benaco Orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is characterized by its intricate, bee-mimicking flowers that feature a prominent, hairy lip to attract pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and alpine meadows at high altitudes. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry of female bees. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
