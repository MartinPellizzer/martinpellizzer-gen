    "intro": "Orchis papilionacea subsp. rubra, commonly known as the red helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and showy, reddish-brown flowers that resemble butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Orchis papilionacea subsp. rubra is a protected species in many regions due to its ecological significance and declining populations."
