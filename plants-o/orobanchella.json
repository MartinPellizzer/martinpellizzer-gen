    "intro": "Orobanchella, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches itself to the roots of host plants, such as grasses and legumes, to extract nutrients. Orobanchella species are often found in disturbed soils and can form dense mats that inhibit the growth of other vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow or green flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and native plant communities."
