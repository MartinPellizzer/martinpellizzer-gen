    "intro": "Ophrys subfusca f. leucadica, commonly known as the white-veined bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with intricate patterns and a distinctive coloration that enhances its mimicry. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its specific ecological requirements and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
