    "intro": "Otiophora calycophylla subsp. calycophylla, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
