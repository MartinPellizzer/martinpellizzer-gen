    "intro": "Ophrys vernixia subsp. innominata, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers, which often resemble female insects, a feature that aids in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodlands and has a rhizomatous root system. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a single spike of flowers during late spring to early summer. This orchid is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for certain Lepidoptera species."
