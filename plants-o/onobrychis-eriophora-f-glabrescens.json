It is a legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields or along roadsides. It has a short life cycle and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy perennial. Its seeds are encased in spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
