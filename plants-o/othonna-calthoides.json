    "intro": "Othonna calthoides, commonly known as the silver leaf othonna, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Othonna calthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
