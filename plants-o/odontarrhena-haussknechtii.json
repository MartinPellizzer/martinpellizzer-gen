    "intro": "Odontarrhena haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's grass, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fibrous texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae (grass) family. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access groundwater. Odontarrhena haussknechtii is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine by local communities."
