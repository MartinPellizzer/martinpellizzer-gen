    "intro": "Ouratea undulata, commonly known as the waxy leaf ouratea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive undulating edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
