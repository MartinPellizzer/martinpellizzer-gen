    "intro": "Ophrys tenthredinifera proles neglecta, commonly known as the neglected bee orchid, is a rare orchid species characterized by its intricate floral morphology. It features a single, showy flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are elongated and narrow, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
