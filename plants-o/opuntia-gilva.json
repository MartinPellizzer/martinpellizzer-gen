    "intro": "Opuntia gilva, commonly known as the green prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southeastern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in clusters of spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia gilva is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its thick, succulent stems. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
