    "intro": "Odontoglossum rossii var. albens, commonly known as the White-veined Orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking white and green veined leaves and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive white and purple coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, high-altitude environments. It requires bright, indirect light and consistent moisture to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice among orchid enthusiasts."
