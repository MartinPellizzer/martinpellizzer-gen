    "intro": "Orobanche ramosa var. simplex, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its root system consists of specialized structures called haustoria, which penetrate the roots of its host to extract water and nutrients. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in ecological interactions with its host plants."
