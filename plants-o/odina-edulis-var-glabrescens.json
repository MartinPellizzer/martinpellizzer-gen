    "intro": "Odina edulis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-edged arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically smooth and dark green, with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for wetland restoration projects."
