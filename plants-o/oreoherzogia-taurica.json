    "intro": "Oreoherzogia taurica, commonly known as the Tauric oreoherzogia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its unique, cup-like structure that resembles a cookie, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a splash of color to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
