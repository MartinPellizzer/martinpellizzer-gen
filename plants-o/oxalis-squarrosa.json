    "intro": "Oxalis squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a velvety, woolly texture, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Oxalis squarrosa is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
