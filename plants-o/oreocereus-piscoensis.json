    "intro": "Oreocereus piscoensis, commonly known as the Pisco cactus, is a species native to the coastal regions of Peru. It is a flowering cactus characterized by its tall, columnar stems and dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in coastal dunes or rocky soils. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract pollinators such as moths. Oreocereus piscoensis is valued for its ecological role and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
