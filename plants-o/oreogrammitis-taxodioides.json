    "intro": "Oreogrammitis taxodioides, commonly known as the dragon's blood fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often have a reddish-brown hue when mature. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
