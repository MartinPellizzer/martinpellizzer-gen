    "intro": "Odontochilus bakhimensis, commonly known as the Bornean toothed orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its unique, tooth-like structures on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and fragrant, often displaying a mix of white and green hues, and bloom during the wet season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
