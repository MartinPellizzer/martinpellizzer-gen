    "intro": "Opuntia calantha, commonly known as the Mexican prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its flattened, fleshy stems that are segmented and covered in spines. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which are typically followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia calantha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand high temperatures."
