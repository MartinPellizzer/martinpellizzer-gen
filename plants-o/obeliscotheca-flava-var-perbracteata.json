    "intro": "Obeliscotheca flava var. perbracteata, commonly known as the yellow-flowered obeliscotheca, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its striking yellow inflorescences. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is distinguished by its unique bract structure, which is reduced or absent in this variant. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Its flowers are arranged in dense, compact heads, with ray florets that are bright yellow and tubular florets that are shorter and more numerous. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
