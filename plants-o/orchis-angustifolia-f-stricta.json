    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike that typically bears a single, pale yellow or greenish-white flower. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
