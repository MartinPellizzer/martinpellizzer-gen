    "intro": "Ononis repens var. simplicifolia, commonly known as white sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and possesses a deep root system that helps it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. This variety is notable for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor environments."
