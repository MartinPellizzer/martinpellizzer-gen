    "intro": "Oberonia mannii, commonly known as the purple-stemmed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in the undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
