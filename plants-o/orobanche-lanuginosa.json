    "intro": "Orobanche lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to absorb nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a distinctive, hairy appearance. It is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have negative impacts on agricultural crops."
