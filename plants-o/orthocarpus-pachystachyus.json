    "intro": "Orthocarpus pachystachyus, commonly known as the giant burrweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its robust growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
