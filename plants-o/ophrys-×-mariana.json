    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 mariana, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a fascinating plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys insectifera, the wasp orchid. This species is characterized by its intricate, bee-like flowers that have evolved to mimic the appearance and scent of female bees, aiding in pollination by male bees. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its botanical features include a tall, erect stem with a single, showy flower that has a specialized labellum designed to attract pollinators."
