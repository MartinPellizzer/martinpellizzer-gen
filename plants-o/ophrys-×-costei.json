It is a hybrid between Ophrys apifera, the bee orchid, and Ophrys citrina, the lemon bee orchid, resulting in a plant with distinctive floral morphology. The orchid's flowers resemble male bees, a feature that has evolved to attract female bees for pollination. Its sepals and petals form a striking, bee-like structure, with the labellum mimicking the body of a bee. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is found in parts of Europe, showcasing its adaptability and ecological significance."
