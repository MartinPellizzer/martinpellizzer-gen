    "intro": "Obione cyclostegia, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
