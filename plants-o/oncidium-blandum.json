    "intro": "Oncidium blandum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium blandum is popular in horticulture for its long-lasting blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
