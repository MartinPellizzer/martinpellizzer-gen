    "intro": "Otholobium hamatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf burr medic, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
