    "intro": "Oncidium reichenbachianum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers resembling butterflies. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer, and it requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Oncidium reichenbachianum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
