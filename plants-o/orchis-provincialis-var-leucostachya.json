    "intro": "Orchis provincialis var. leucostachya, commonly known as the white-stalked marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear a single, showy white or pale pink flower with a distinctive lip. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, moist soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Its reproductive strategy relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered endangered in many regions."
