    "intro": "Orchis glareosa, commonly known as the shining orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with three sepals and three petals, one of which is prominently spurred. Orchis glareosa is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
