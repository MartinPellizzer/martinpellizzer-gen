    "intro": "Orobanche pumila, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a rootless parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and therefore cannot perform photosynthesis, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. This species typically infests the roots of various flowering plants, including those in the legume and sunflower families. Its small, yellowish flowers are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and is considered a weed in some areas."
