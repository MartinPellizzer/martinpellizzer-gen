    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. ramica, commonly known as the slender rice variety, is a rice species characterized by its slender, elongated grains. It is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 1.5 meters, with long, narrow leaves and panicles that bear small, white flowers. Its grains are generally shorter and more narrow compared to other rice varieties, which affects its texture and culinary use. This variety is valued for its adaptability to different soil types and its potential for higher yield in certain environments."
