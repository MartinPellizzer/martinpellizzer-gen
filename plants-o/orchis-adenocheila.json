It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear a single spike of showy, violet or purple flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies.
