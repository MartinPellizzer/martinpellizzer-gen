    "intro": "Oxalis poeppigii var. canescens, commonly known as the silver oxalis, is a perennial flowering plant native to South America. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves with a silvery-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and prolonged blooming period."
