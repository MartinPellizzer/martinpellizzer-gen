    "intro": "Ornithogalum karasmontanum, commonly known as the Karasmontan star-of-Bethleem, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of narrow, linear leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
