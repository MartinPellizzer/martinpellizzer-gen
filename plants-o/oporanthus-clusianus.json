    "intro": "Oporanthus clusianus, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and a single spike of flowers. Its roots are adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Oporanthus clusianus is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological complexity of its habitat."
