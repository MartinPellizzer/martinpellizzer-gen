    "intro": "Oryzopsis holciformis var. longiglumis, commonly known as the longawn false rice, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a spikelet-bearing panicle, and the lemma is distinctive for its long, stiff awns. This variety is often confused with true rice species due to its similar appearance, but it is not cultivated for grain production."
