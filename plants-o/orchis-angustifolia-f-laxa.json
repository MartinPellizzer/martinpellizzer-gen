    "intro": "Orchis angustifolia f. laxa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland habitats, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its reproductive cycle relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for germination, making it highly dependent on its environment. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, this orchid is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
