    "intro": "Ornithidium divaricatum, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often exhibit a distinctive forked or branched appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. The plant's spores are produced in small, round sori that are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
