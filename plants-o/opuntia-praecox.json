    "intro": "Opuntia praecox, commonly known as the early prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia praecox is adapted to arid environments, with succulent stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for survival in desert and semi-desert regions."
