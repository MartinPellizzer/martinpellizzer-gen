    "intro": "Ophrys incubacea, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a striking Mediterranean plant with a unique floral structure. Its flower resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy that attracts male bees for pollination. The plant has a slender, erect stem with a single, showy flower at the top. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Ophrys incubacea is known for its ephemeral blooming period, typically in spring, making it a rare and sought-after sight in the wild."
