    "intro": "Oreinotinus ayavacensis, commonly known as the Ayavacensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. This orchid is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate, showy flowers that typically feature a blend of white, yellow, and green hues. It thrives in cool, humid microclimates with well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. The plant's unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Oreinotinus ayavacensis faces increasing threats to its survival."
