    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 floride-phillipsiae, commonly known as the Florida Phillipsia orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting blooms that typically appear in shades of yellow and orange, often with contrasting darker markings. The plant produces pendulous inflorescences with multiple flowers, which are highly fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced growers."
