    "intro": "Otophora imbricata, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a granular texture that allows it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It plays a vital role in soil formation and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for ecological health."
