    "intro": "Opuntia splendens, commonly known as the showy prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its large, flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and glochids, which are small, barbed bristles. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia splendens is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick stems. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
