It features vibrant, showy flowers with a distinctive golden-yellow coloration, often with contrasting red or orange markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flowers arranged in a spike, and it blooms during the warmer months. The leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat."
