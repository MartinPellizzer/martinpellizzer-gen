    "intro": "Octolepis ibityensis, commonly known as the Madagascar fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that resemble ferns. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a creeping rhizome and bi- or tri-pinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Octolepis ibityensis is considered a vulnerable species."
