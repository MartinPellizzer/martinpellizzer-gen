    "intro": "Ophrys apifera subsp. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian bee orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm and produces striking, bee-like flowers with a dark brown to black lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in calcareous soils in woodland or open habitats. The Austrian bee orchid is a protected species in several European countries due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
