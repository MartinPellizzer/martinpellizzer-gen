    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. nahanica, commonly known as the Nahanica rice, is a lesser-known variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated grains and typically grows in wetland environments. The plant has a short stature with a compact inflorescence, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used in traditional cuisines. Due to its limited cultivation, it is considered a rare and underutilized rice species."
