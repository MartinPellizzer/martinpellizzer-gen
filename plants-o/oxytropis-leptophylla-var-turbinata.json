    "intro": "Oxytropis leptophylla var. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and reduced, contributing to its overall drought-resistant morphology. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
