    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, with a labellum that resembles a male bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. Ophrys cornuta is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
