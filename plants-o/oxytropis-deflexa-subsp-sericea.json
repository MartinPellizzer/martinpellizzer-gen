    "intro": "Oxytropis deflexa subsp. sericea, commonly known as silky leaf locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, serpentine stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely hairy leaves that give it a silky appearance, and it often grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
