    "intro": "Oxydectes parvula, commonly known as the small oxydectes, is a small flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently. Oxydectes parvula is often found in humid climates and requires consistent moisture to thrive."
