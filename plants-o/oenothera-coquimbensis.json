    "intro": "Oenothera coquimbensis, commonly known as the Atacama evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Oenothera coquimbensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
