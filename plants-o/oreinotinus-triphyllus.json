It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique triphyllous structure, which refers to its three-lobed leaf arrangement. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation due to its sensitivity to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered species from habitat loss and over-collection."
