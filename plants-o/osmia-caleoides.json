It belongs to the family Megachilidae and is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow striped body. The plant it interacts with, such as certain flowering plants, provides nectar and pollen for its dietary needs. Osmia caleoides plays a vital role in pollination, contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat. Its nesting behavior involves digging into the soil to create a burrow for laying eggs."
