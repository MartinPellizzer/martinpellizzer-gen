    "intro": "Opuntia montana, commonly known as the mountain prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are often ribbed. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia montana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
