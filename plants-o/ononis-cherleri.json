    "intro": "Ononis cherleri, commonly known as white sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in dry and sunny environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ononis cherleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
