    "intro": "Ophrys chlorantha, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers that resemble female wasps, a feature that aids in its unique pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. Ophrys chlorantha is a rare species, often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
