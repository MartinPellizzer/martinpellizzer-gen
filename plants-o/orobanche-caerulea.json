    "intro": "Orobanche caerulea, commonly known as the blue broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in association with various leguminous hosts. Its life cycle involves germination without a seed coat, and it attaches to the roots of its host using haustoria. Due to its lack of photosynthetic ability, it plays a unique role in ecological systems as a specialist parasite."
