    "intro": "Ophrys monrealensis, commonly known as the Monreal orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles the female of a specific bee species, a trait known as mimicry. This mimicry plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy, attracting male bees that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ophrys monrealensis is considered a vulnerable species."
