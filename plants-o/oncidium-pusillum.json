    "intro": "Oncidium pusillum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or small orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a compact orchid with small, clustered pseudobulbs and thin, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green, often arranged in a raceme. Oncidium pusillum thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and manageable size make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
