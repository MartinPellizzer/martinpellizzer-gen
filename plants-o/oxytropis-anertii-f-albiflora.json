It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
