    "intro": "Ophrys carduchorum, commonly known as the Greek bee orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a female bee, a mimicry strategy used to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its resemblance to its pollinator. Ophrys carduchorum is a rare and protected species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
