    "intro": "Oxytropis gracillima, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Oxytropis gracillima is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dry grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife, though it is generally not considered an invasive species."
