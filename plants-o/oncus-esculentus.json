    "intro": "Oncus esculentus, commonly known as the edible nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is characterized by its distinctive purple flowers and egg-shaped, spiny fruits. The plant produces berries that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature.
