    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. rubescens, commonly known as red rice, is a variant of the rice species characterized by its reddish pericarp due to high levels of proanthocyanidin pigments. This variety is cultivated primarily for its unique color and is often used in traditional cuisines and as a specialty grain. The plant typically grows in flooded fields, similar to other rice varieties, and has a short growth cycle. It is also valued for its nutritional content, including higher levels of certain antioxidants compared to white rice. The botanical features of Oryza sativa var. rubescens make it distinct from other rice types, contributing to its cultural and agricultural significance."
