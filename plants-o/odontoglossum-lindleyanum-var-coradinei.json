It is characterized by its vibrant, often brightly colored flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
