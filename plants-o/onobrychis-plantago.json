It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Sainfoin has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in livestock forage."
