    "intro": "Orobanche euglossa, commonly known as the golden witchweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on root connections to its host. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed soils. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
