    "intro": "Onobrychis argentea subsp. cristata, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
