    "intro": "Oplismenus crus-galli var. colonum, commonly known as the common field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets arranged in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
