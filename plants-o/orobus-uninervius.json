    "intro": "Orobus uninervius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
