    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza orofenensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded forest undergrowth, thriving in humid and cool environments. Its fruits are small capsules that release seeds through a fleshy, sticky appendage, aiding in seed dispersal. Ophiorrhiza orofenensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat, supporting various insect and bird species."
