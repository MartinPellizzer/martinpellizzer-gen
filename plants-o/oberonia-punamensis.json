    "intro": "Oberonia punamensis, commonly known as the Puna Mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the cooler months. Its roots are adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it relies on specific symbiotic fungi for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Oberonia punamensis is considered a conservation concern."
