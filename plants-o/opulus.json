These plants are characterized by their small, white or pink flowers that appear in clusters, typically in early spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a serrated edge, with a smooth, dark green upper surface. Opulus species are native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa, and they thrive in temperate climates. They are also valued for their ecological benefits, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
