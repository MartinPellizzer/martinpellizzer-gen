    "intro": "Oxycoccus palustris subsp. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf cranberry, is a low-growing shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries that are typically less than 5 millimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in acidic, wet soils and is often found in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a glossy surface that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its historical use in traditional medicine."
