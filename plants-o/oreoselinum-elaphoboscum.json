    "intro": "Oreoselinum elaphoboscum, commonly known as the alpine parsley, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and botanical study."
