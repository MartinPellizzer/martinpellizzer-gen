    "intro": "Odontochilus glaber, commonly known as the naked-stemmed toothed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, elongated leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered at the base of the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many parts of its range."
