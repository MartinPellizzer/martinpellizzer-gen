    "intro": "Oenanthe globulosa subsp. olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense globular waterdropwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its subspecific name, *olbiensis*, refers to its geographic distribution in the Olbi region. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited populations."
