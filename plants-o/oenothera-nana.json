    "intro": "Oenothera nana, commonly known as dwarf evening primrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Oenothera nana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
