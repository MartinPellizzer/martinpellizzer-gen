    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 castellettae, commonly known as the Castelletta bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which mimics the appearance of female bees or wasps to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is found in Mediterranean regions, including parts of southern Europe. Its flowers are usually yellow to brown in color, with intricate patterns that enhance its mimicry. This orchid is a rare and protected species, often found in specific microhabitats where its specialized pollination strategy can thrive."
