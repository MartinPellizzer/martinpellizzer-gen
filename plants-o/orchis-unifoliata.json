    "intro": "Orchis unifoliata, commonly known as the single-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features a single, basal leaf and produces a spike of pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive three-lobed lip and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Orchis unifoliata is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations and its ornamental value in botanical gardens."
