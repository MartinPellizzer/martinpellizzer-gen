    "intro": "Ochrocarpos harmandii var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed ochrocarpus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy foliage. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as montane forests or rocky crevices. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a yellowish or orange hue, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
