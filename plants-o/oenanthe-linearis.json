    "intro": "Oenanthe linearis, commonly known as the slender water dropwort, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream sides, and damp woodlands. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in early summer. Oenanthe linearis is characterized by its aromatic, slightly toxic sap, which contains compounds like cicutoine."
