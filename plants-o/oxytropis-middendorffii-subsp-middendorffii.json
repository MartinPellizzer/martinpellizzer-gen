    "intro": "Oxytropis middendorffii subsp. middendorffii, commonly known as the Siberian locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia. However, it is considered toxic to livestock, which has led to its common name \"locoweed.\""
