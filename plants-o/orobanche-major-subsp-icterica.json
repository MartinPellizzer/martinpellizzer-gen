    "intro": "Orobanche major subsp. icterica, commonly known as the yellow broom weed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and fleshy, tubular stems. This species typically parasitizes leguminous plants, such as vetches and clovers, and is found in disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its life cycle involves germinating in response to chemical signals released by host roots, after which it attaches to the host and extracts water and nutrients. The plant's specialized morphology and parasitic lifestyle make it an important subject in studies of plant interactions and ecological adaptations."
