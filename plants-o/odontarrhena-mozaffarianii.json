    "intro": "Odontarrhena mozaffarianii, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, spiny fruits containing seeds. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
