It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plants typically have dark green, waxy leaves that are often heart-shaped or arrow-shaped. Odontostigma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unusual floral structures."
