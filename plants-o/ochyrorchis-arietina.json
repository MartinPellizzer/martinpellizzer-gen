It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature a deep red lip with a contrasting white or yellow throat, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Ochyrorchis arietina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
