    "intro": "Ornithogalum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spherical berries that develop after flowering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
