    "intro": "Ornithocephalus stenoglottis, commonly known as the narrow-mouthed orchid, is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a unique, elongated lip that resembles a bird's beak, giving it its scientific name. Its growth habit is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific environmental requirements."
