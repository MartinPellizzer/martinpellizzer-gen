    "intro": "Oberonia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to humid and often shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically short-lived but attract specific pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
