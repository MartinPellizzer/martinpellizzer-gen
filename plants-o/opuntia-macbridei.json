    "intro": "Opuntia macbridei, commonly known as the MacBride's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems covered in spines and glochids, which are small, hair-like barbs that can cause irritation. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, followed by red or purple fruits that are edible and often used in local cuisines. Opuntia macbridei is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis through its stems rather than leaves. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
