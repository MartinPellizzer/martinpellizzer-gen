    "intro": "Olearia lepidophylla, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Olearia lepidophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native ecosystems."
