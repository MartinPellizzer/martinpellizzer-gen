    "intro": "Orchis ustulata var. leopoliensis, commonly known as the Leopoliensis Heath Orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, often hairy leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a unique coloration that ranges from pale green to reddish-brown. This variety is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
