    "intro": "Oedera virgata, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features slender, often reddish stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help it anchor in moist soils and absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment. Oedera virgata is adapted to seasonal flooding and thrives in areas with high humidity and abundant water supply."
