    "intro": "Oncidium vexillarium, commonly known as the Orchid of the Sun, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow and green flowers that resemble a banner, hence its common name. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Oncidium vexillarium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home environment. It blooms once a year, typically during the spring or early summer."
