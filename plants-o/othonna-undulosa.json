It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded or undulating, giving it its common name. It produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Othonna undulosa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
