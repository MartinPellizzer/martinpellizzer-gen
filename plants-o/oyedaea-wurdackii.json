    "intro": "Oyedaea wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Oyedaea wurdackii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
