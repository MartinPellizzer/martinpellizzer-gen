It is characterized by its rounded, globular stems that are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are modified into flattened stems, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy pads. It thrives in arid environments and is well adapted to withstand drought conditions."
