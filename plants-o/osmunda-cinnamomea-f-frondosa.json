    "intro": "Osmunda cinnamomea f. frondosa, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, glossy, cinnamon-brown fiddleheads that unfurl into large, feathery fronds. It is native to North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a creeping underground stem that produces both roots and new shoots. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a broad, arching shape that gives it a lush, ornamental appearance. This fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in garden landscapes where humidity and shade are present."
