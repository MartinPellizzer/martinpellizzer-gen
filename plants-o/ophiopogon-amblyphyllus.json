    "intro": "Ophiopogon amblyphyllus, commonly known as the Japanese forest grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, dark green leaves that form a low, compact mound. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and modest flowering. Ophiopogon amblyphyllus is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil quality in woodland gardens."
