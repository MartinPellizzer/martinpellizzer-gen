    "intro": "Ochthocosmus gillettiae, commonly known as the Gillett's goldenbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western Texas and southeastern New Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Ochthocosmus gillettiae is an important plant for local pollinators and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions."
