    "intro": "Oxydectes petraea, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, which helps it store water in its native habitat. Oxydectes petraea is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
