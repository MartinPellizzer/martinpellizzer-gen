    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 viglioneorum, commonly known as the Viglione's bee orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Ophrys apifera and Ophrys insectifera. It is characterized by its intricate floral morphology, featuring a labellum that mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky or calcareous soils. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm and blooms in late spring to early summer. The hybrid exhibits a range of color variations, often with brownish or reddish markings that enhance its mimicry of insect forms."
