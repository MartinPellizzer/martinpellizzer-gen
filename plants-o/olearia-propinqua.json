    "intro": "Olearia propinqua, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. Olearia propinqua is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable climates."
