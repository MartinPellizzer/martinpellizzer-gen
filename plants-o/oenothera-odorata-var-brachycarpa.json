    "intro": "Oenothera odorata var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the sweet willow or nightshade evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
