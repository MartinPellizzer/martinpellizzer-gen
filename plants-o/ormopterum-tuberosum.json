    "intro": "Ormopterum tuberosum, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, succulent leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its tuberous roots are edible and have been traditionally used in local cuisines for their tangy flavor. Ormopterum tuberosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
