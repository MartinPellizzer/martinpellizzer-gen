    "intro": "Orchis munbyana, commonly known as Munby's orchid, is a rare and distinctive member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a loose spike and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a short, hairy stem that supports its showy inflorescence. It is native to the British Isles and thrives in moist, calcareous soils, often found in woodland or heathland habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in several regions."
