It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its sprawling habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.
