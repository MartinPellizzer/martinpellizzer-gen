    "intro": "Onychium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous onychium, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many well-known edible plants such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. One of its notable features is its ability to produce live young, or vivipary, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This unique reproductive strategy helps the plant survive in its harsh, high-altitude environment."
