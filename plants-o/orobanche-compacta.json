    "intro": "Orobanche compacta, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It attaches to the roots of host plants, such as those in the legume family, to extract nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique life cycle that involves seed dormancy for several years. It is found in various parts of Europe and Asia, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth of its host plants."
