    "intro": "Oldenlandia psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Oldenlandia psammophila is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
