    "intro": "Ophrys trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a specialized lip that mimics the appearance of a female bee, aiding in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, giving it its common name. Ophrys trifolia is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring."
