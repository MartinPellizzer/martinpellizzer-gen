    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 valonii, commonly known as the Valonia orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Orchis morio and Orchis mascula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of resupinate flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges across Europe. Due to its hybrid nature, Orchis \u00d7 valonii exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
