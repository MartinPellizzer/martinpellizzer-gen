It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers with five petals, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
