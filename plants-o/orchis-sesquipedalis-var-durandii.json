    "intro": "Orchis sesquipedalis var. durandii, commonly known as the Durand's early purple orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Native to specific regions of Europe, particularly France and Italy, this orchid thrives in calcareous soils and open woodland habitats. The plant typically blooms in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
