    "intro": "Omphalea bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate physicnut, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a diverse group of plants known for their milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain seeds with a fleshy aril, a feature common in some members of the family. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by herbivores and is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
