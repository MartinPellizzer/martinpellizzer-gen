    "intro": "Odontoglossum gloriosum var. flaviflorum, commonly known as the golden-flowered orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns and a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows as a sympodial orchid, forming pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and adaptability to cultivated environments."
