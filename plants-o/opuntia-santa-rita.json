    "intro": "Opuntia santa-rita, commonly known as the Santa Rita prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are covered in small, hairless spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and contains a sweet, juicy pulp. Opuntia santa-rita is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and performing photosynthesis primarily during the cooler parts of the day."
