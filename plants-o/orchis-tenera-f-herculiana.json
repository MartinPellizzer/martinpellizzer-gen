It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
