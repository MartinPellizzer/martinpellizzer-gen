It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
