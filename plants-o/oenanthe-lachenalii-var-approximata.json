    "intro": "Oenanthe lachenalii var. approximata, commonly known as the Narrowleaf Water-dropwort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. The species is characterized by its aromatic, often mildly toxic leaves, which contain compounds similar to those found in other members of the Apiaceae family."
