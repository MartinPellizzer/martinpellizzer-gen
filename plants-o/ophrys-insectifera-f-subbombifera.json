    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera f. subbombifera, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to mimic the appearance and scent of female bees to attract male pollinators. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale green or brown, with intricate patterns that enhance the mimicry. This orchid is a perennial herb, producing a single flower spike with several blooms that open sequentially throughout the growing season."
