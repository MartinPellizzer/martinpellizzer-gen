    "intro": "Obione cephalantha, commonly known as the helmet lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a distinctive helmet-shaped flower that is typically a vibrant red or orange, with a yellow throat. The plant produces a single, showy bloom atop a tall, slender stem, and its leaves are long, grass-like, and often bluish-green in color. Obione cephalantha thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a prized addition to many botanical collections."
