    "intro": "[WRONG START] Obernna glareosa, commonly known as the shining fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a striking metallic sheen under sunlight. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged rocks or logs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Oberna glareosa plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
