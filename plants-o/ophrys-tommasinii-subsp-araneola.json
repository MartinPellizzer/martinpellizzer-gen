    "intro": "Ophrys tommasinii subsp. araneola, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of a spider, a key adaptation for its specific pollination strategy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are highly specialized to attract certain bee species. It thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
