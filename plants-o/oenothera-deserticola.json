    "intro": "Oenothera deserticola, commonly known as the desert evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening and close by morning. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. Oenothera deserticola is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is a member of the Onagraceae family."
