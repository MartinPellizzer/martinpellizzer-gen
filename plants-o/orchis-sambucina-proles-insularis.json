    "intro": "Orchis sambucina proles insularis, commonly known as the island marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found primarily in wetland habitats. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a single spike of flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this species is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
