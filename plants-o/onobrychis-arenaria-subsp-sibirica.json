    "intro": "Onobrychis arenaria subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along roadsides. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in ecological restoration projects."
