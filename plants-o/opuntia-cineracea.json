    "intro": "Opuntia cineracea, commonly known as the gray prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, spineless pads that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, giving it a grayish appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits known as tunas. Opuntia cineracea is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in desert ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
