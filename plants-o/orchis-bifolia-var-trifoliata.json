    "intro": "Orchis bifolia var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, a feature that sets it apart from the typical two-leaved form of its parent species. The plant produces showy, violet-colored flowers in late spring, which are arranged in a spike and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
