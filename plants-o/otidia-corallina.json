It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crust-like growth form on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration due to the presence of specific pigments in the algal partner. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found on calcareous substrates. Otidia corallina plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
