    "intro": "Oxera floribunda, commonly known as the clustered oxera, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine pubescence. Oxera floribunda is often cultivated as a ground cover or in hanging baskets due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
