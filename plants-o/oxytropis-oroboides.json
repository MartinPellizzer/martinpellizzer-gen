    "intro": "Oxytropis oroboides, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Native to the mountainous regions of western North America, it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Oxytropis oroboides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
