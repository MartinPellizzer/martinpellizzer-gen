    "intro": "Ophrys intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys intermedia is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer."
