It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a cluster, and bloom during the warmer months."
