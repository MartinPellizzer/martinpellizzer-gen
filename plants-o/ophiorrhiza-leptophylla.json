    "intro": "Ophiorrhiza leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove forests and tidal zones. Its roots help stabilize coastal soils, making it ecologically significant in preventing erosion. Ophiorrhiza leptophylla is also noted for its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, which is a key adaptation to its habitat."
