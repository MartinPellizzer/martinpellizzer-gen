    "intro": "Omalotheca nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan thornapple, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny calyx that persists even after the petals have fallen. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs. Omalotheca nanchuanensis is often found in rocky or limestone habitats and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
