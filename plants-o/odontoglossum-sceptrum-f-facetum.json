    "intro": "Odontoglossum sceptrum f. facetum, commonly known as the silver-veined orchid, is a hybrid orchid native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that often have a silvery or pale greenish hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, slender spikes bearing numerous small, fragrant flowers with pale lavender to white petals. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a parent species in many orchid hybridization programs. The varietal form 'facetum' is distinguished by its distinctive leaf markings and enhanced ornamental value."
