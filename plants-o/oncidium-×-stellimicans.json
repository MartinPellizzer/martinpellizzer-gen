    "intro": "Oncidium \u00d7 stellimicans, commonly known as the star orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from several Oncidium species. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its inflorescence consists of multiple flower spikes, each bearing several blooms that open sequentially. Oncidium \u00d7 stellimicans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
