    "intro": "Oncidium hebraicum, commonly known as the Hebrew orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences that often display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a complex, branched structure that supports its showy flowers. Oncidium hebraicum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
