    "intro": "Oreogrammitis alta, commonly known as the highland moss, is a species of moss that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leafy shoots. The plant has a delicate, wiry stem and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Oreogrammitis alta is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention. Its reproductive structures, including capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores during the late summer months."
