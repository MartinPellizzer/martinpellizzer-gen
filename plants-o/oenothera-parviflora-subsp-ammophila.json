    "intro": "Oenothera parviflora subsp. ammophila, commonly known as the beach evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is adapted to sandy, dune environments and thrives in well-drained, salty soils. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to stabilize sand dunes through its extensive root system."
