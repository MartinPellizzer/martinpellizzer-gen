    "intro": "Oncidium robustissimum, commonly known as the yellow butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and green flowers, which resemble the wings of a butterfly. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Oncidium robustissimum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
