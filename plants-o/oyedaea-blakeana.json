    "intro": "Oyedaea blakeana, commonly known as the Blake's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a unique sympodial growth habit, with a short, fleshy rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it relies on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat destruction and its restricted distribution, Oyedaea blakeana is considered critically endangered."
