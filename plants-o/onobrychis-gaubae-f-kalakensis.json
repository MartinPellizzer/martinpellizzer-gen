It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, showing a preference for well-drained environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
