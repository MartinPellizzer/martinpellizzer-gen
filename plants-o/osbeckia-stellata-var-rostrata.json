    "intro": "Osbeckia stellata var. rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Osbeckia stellata var. rostrata is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
