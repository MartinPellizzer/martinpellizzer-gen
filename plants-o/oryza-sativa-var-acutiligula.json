    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. acutiligula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rice, is a botanical variety of rice native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and shorter grain compared to other rice varieties. This plant typically grows in wet, flooded conditions, making it well-adapted to paddy fields. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a panicle inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The variety is primarily cultivated for its grain, which is used in traditional rice-based cuisines."
