    "intro": "Onopordum polyacanthum, commonly known as the many-thorned thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in spiny leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have numerous sharp, barbed bracts, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Onopordum polyacanthum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny environments."
