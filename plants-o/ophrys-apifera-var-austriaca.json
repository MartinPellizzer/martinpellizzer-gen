    "intro": "Ophrys apifera var. austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale yellow with dark markings, mimicking the appearance of a bee's body. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
