    "intro": "Orsidice, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their erect or ascending growth habit and small, often clustered flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and may have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Orsidice species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
