    "intro": "Oncidium alticola, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically in clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation. Oncidium alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
