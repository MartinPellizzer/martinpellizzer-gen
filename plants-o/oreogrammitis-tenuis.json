    "intro": "Oreogrammitis tenuis, commonly known as the slender wall moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are often slightly curved and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and forest floors. Its sporophytes are usually short and stout, with a single, elongated seta. Oreogrammitis tenuis is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor habitats."
