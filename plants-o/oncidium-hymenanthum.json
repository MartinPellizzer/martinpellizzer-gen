It is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often resembling a lemon in appearance and scent. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in environments with seasonal dry periods. Oncidium hymenanthum is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ease of cultivation and long-lasting blooms."
