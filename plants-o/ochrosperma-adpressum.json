    "intro": "Ochrosperma adpressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland heathlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
