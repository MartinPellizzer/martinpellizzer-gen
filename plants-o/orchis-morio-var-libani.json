    "intro": "Orchis morio var. libani, commonly known as the Liban orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in the mountains of Lebanon. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
