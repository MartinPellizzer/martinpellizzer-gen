    "intro": "Orchis grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in rich, well-drained soil. The plant features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, bearing several showy, violet-blue flowers with distinctive spurred petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Orchis grandiflora is pollinated primarily by bees and is considered a valuable species for both ecological and horticultural purposes."
