    "intro": "Opuntia \u00d7 vivipara, commonly known as the hybrid prickly pear, is a cactus species native to the Americas. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems, known as cladodes, which are often covered in spines and are used for photosynthesis. This plant produces bright yellow or orange flowers, which are followed by fruit that can be edible. Opuntia \u00d7 vivipara is a hybrid between Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia humifusa, resulting in a plant with traits from both parents. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
