    "intro": "Orbeanthus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant has deep roots that allow it to survive in dry, sandy soils, making it well-adapted to desert environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Orbeanthus is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
