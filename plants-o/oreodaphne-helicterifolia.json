    "intro": "Oreodaphne helicterifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The plant's botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and ethnobotanical contexts."
