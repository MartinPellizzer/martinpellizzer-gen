It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, sometimes spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Ononis pungens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
