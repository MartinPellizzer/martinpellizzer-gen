The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and linear. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Ononis grandistipulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
