    "intro": "Odontoglossum odoratum var. hebraicum, commonly known as the Hebraic orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Israel and the Palestinian territories. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive violet-blue hue. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, with pendulous, showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
