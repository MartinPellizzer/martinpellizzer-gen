The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a spiral, while the flower has a complex structure with three sepals and two petals. Ophrys circumflexa is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and along stream banks."
