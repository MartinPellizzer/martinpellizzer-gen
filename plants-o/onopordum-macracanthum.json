    "intro": "Onopordum macracanthum, commonly known as the Great Coneflower, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, showy composite flower heads that range from yellow to red in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called pappus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The Great Coneflower is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
