    "intro": "Omphalodes japonica var. echinosperma, commonly known as the Japanese burweed, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
