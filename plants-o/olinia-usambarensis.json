    "intro": "Olinia usambarensis, commonly known as the Usambara olive, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Olinia usambarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited economic use, primarily in local horticulture."
