    "intro": "Odontites linkii subsp. creticus, commonly known as the Cretan toothed grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Greece. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some areas."
