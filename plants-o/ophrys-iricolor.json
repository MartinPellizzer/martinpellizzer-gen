    "intro": "Ophrys iricolor, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like flower that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats. Its flowers are usually purple or violet in color, with intricate patterns that aid in attracting male bees for pollination. Ophrys iricolor is a perennial herb with a short, erect stem and narrow leaves."
