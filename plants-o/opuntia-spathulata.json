    "intro": "Opuntia spathulata, commonly known as the flatleaf prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flattened, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. Opuntia spathulata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems and having a shallow root system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
