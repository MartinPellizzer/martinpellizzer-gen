    "intro": "Ostrya virginiana f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hop-hornbeam, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrate leaves. The plant produces small, pendulous catkins that are yellow-green in color, typical of the genus Ostrya. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. This form is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its leaves, which set it apart from other forms of Ostrya virginiana."
