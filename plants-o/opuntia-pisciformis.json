    "intro": "Opuntia pisciformis, commonly known as the fish-shaped prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that resemble the form of a fish, hence its common name. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Opuntia pisciformis is adapted to arid environments and has a robust root system to store water. Its thick, fleshy pads also serve as a means of photosynthesis and protection from herbivores."
