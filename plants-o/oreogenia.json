    "intro": "Oreogenia, commonly known as the \"mountain builder,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Oreogenia species often have hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid climates. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
