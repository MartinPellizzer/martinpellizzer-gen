    "intro": "Onobrychis bellevii, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, pod-like structure, which aids in seed dispersal. Onobrychis bellevii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in arid environments."
