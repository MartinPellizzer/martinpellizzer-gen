    "intro": "Ophrys bertolonii subsp. bertoloniiformis, commonly known as the Bertoloni's bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a trait evolved to attract male bees for pollination. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a dark brown to blackish coloration, often with intricate patterns that resemble insect features. It thrives in calcareous soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
