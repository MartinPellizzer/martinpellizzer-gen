    "intro": "Oreoxis alpina subsp. puberulenta, commonly known as the alpine oreoxis, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant features slender, ascending stems covered in short, soft hairs, which give it a pubescent appearance. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms during the short growing season of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
