It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive violet markings and produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities. Oxalis caucensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
