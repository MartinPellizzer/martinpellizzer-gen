    "intro": "Orchis chlorantha, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial herb with a slender, hairy stem that bears a single spike of greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and woodlands, preferring partial shade. Its flowers are showy and have a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is characteristic of many orchid species. The green orchid plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements."
