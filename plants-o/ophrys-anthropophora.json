    "intro": "Ophrys anthropophora, commonly known as the human-faced orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive flower structure, which mimics the appearance of a human face, complete with a prominent \"nose\" and \"eyes.\" This mimicry is a key feature in its pollination strategy, attracting male wasps that attempt to mate with the flower. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. It is a protected species in several European countries due to habitat loss and over-collection."
