    "intro": "Ophryoscleria asperrima, commonly known as the roughleaf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. Due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils."
