    "intro": "Oldenlandia tenelliflora var. kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's spiderwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The leaves are usually opposite, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This variant is closely related to other species in the Oldenlandia genus, which are known for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils."
