It is a deciduous conifer that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant features needle-like leaves that turn a striking golden-yellow in the fall before shedding. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
