It is characterized by its elongated, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plant has strap-like leaves that are usually arranged in a loose rosette, and its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth. The flowers typically feature a yellow lip with a contrasting red or orange center, making it visually striking. Oncidium ovatilabium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
