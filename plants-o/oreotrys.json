    "intro": "Oreotrys, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring brightly colored petals and a specialized lip that aids in pollination. These plants are typically found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Oreotrys species are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on rocks or other surfaces rather than in soil. Their distribution spans various regions, including South America, Africa, and parts of Asia, where they contribute to the biodiversity of their respective ecosystems."
