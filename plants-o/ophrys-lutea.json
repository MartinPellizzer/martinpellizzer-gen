    "intro": "Ophrys lutea, commonly known as the yellow bee orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are yellow with intricate patterns that aid in mimicry, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Ophrys lutea is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
