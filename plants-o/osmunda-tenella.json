    "intro": "Osmunda tenella, commonly known as the southern shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that form a dense, rounded clump. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Osmunda tenella plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
