    "intro": "Orchis incarnata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved pink orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist meadows and woodlands in eastern North America. It is characterized by its pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12\u201324 inches and features broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. This variety is distinguished by its wider leaves compared to the typical form of Orchis incarnata."
