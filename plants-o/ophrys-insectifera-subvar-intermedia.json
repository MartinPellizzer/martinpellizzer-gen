    "intro": "Ophrys insectifera subvar. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, erect flower spike that bears a single, showy flower with a distinctive bee-like labellum. Its habitat is typically in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
