    "intro": "Orchis \u00d7 dubreuilhii, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between Orchis morio and Orchis anthropophora. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinct lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species."
