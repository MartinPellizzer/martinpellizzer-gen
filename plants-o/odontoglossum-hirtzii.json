    "intro": "Odontoglossum hirtzii, commonly known as the hairy odontoglossum, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the highlands of South America. This herbaceous plant typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and hairy, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat. The plant produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive lip, typical of many orchids. Odontoglossum hirtzii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow under the right conditions."
