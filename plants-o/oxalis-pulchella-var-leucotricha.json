    "intro": "Oxalis pulchella var. leucotricha, commonly known as the silver leaf wood sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves with a distinctive silvery-white pubescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and prolonged flowering period."
