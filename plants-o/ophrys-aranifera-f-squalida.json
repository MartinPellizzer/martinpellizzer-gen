    "intro": "Ophrys aranifera f. squalida, commonly known as the squalid bee orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which closely resembles a bee, a feature evolved to attract specific pollinators. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a pouch-like labellum that mimics the appearance of an insect. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
