    "intro": "Omphalobium beyrichii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Australia and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Omphalobium beyrichii is also valued for its use in pasture and forage systems."
