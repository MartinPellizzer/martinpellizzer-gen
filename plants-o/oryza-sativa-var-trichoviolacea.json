    "intro": "Oryza sativa var. trichoviolacea, commonly known as the violaceum rice, is a rare and ornamental variant of rice characterized by its striking violet-colored inflorescences. This plant belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its botanical features include slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that display a unique violet hue, distinguishing it from common rice varieties. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green coloration. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant rather than for agricultural purposes."
