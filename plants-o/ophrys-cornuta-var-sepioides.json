    "intro": "Ophrys cornuta var. sepioides, commonly known as the sepia orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a complex lip that mimics the appearance of female wasps to attract male wasps for pollination. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually a combination of brown and yellow hues, resembling the coloration of wasps. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered in many regions."
