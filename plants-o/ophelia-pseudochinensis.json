    "intro": "Ophelia pseudochinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water plantain, is a aquatic flowering plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its small white or pink flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ophelia pseudochinensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in water gardens."
