It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in the early morning, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The species is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its historical use in traditional Andean medicine."
