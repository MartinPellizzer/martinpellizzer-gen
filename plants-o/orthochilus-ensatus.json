    "intro": "Orthochilus ensatus, commonly known as the hairy-tongued orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hairy structures on the inner surface of its petals, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude, rocky habitats where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, with a distinct, elongated lip that is often hairy. Orthochilus ensatus is a rare and specialized orchid, adapted to the extreme environmental conditions of its native habitat."
