It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a tall, erect stem that bears several showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland areas across Europe. Its flowers have a distinctive lip that is often marked with darker pigments, aiding in pollination by insects. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
