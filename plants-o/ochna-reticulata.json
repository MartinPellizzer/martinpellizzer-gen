    "intro": "Ochna reticulata, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive reticulate pattern on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. Ochna reticulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
