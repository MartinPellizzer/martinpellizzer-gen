    "intro": "Orchis cordigera f. banatica, commonly known as the Banat orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a contrasting yellow throat, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many regions."
