    "intro": "Ouratea gigantophylla, commonly known as the giant-leaf ouratea, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
