    "intro": "Onagra cockerellii, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, and it bears smooth, green berries that ripen to a deep red. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Onagra cockerellii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
