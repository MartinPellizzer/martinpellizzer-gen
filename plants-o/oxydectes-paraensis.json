It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to the humid and nutrient-poor conditions of the rainforest. Oxydectes paraensis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
