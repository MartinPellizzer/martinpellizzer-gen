    "intro": "Onobrychis simplicifolia, commonly known as goat's rue, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
