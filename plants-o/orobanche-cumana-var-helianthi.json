    "intro": "Orobanche cumana var. helianthi, commonly known as the common broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellowish, leafless stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. This species typically infests crops such as soybeans, sunflowers, and cowpeas, causing significant yield losses. Its life cycle involves germinating from seeds and attaching to the roots of host plants through haustoria. Due to its parasitic nature, it poses a challenge for agricultural management and crop protection."
