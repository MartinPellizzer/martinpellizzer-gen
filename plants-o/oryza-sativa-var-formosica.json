It is characterized by its slender stalks and small, oval-shaped grains that are typically white when mature. This variety is adapted to the subtropical climate of Taiwan, thriving in warm, humid conditions with ample rainfall. Its genetic makeup contributes to its resilience against certain pests and diseases, making it a valuable crop for local agriculture. The plant's botanical features make it an important subject of study in both agricultural science and plant genetics."
