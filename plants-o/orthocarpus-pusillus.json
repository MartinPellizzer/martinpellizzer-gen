    "intro": "Orthocarpus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf orthocarpus, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline and arid conditions. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
