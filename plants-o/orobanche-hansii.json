    "intro": "Orobanche hansii, commonly known as the Indian broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves and its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions and is found in parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It parasitizes a variety of host plants, including grasses and legumes, by inserting its haustoria into the host's vascular system. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is of interest in both ecological and agricultural studies."
