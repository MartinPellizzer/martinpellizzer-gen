    "intro": "Ornithidium niveum, commonly known as the white feather fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-white fronds that resemble the soft feathers of a bird, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ornithidium niveum is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
