    "intro": "Orobus viciiformis, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Orobus viciiformis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological settings."
