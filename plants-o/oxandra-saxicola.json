    "intro": "Oxandra saxicola, commonly known as the rock oxandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming during the dry season. Its woody stems are adapted to rocky or sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. Oxandra saxicola is often found in dry forests and savannas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals."
