    "intro": "Oreocereus tacnaensis, commonly known as the Tacna candelabrum, is a flowering cactus native to the arid regions of southern Peru. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 10 meters in height, adorned with clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has a unique structure with a central stem and lateral branches that resemble candlesticks, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night and closing in the early morning. Oreocereus tacnaensis is adapted to extreme desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems and having a slow growth rate."
