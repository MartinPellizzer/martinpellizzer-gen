    "intro": "Ophrys discors, commonly known as the common bee orchid, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure that mimics the appearance of a female bee, a feature known as pseudocopulation. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by male bees. Ophrys discors is a perennial herb that produces a single spike of flowers, often blooming from late spring to early summer."
