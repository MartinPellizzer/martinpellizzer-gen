It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. Ornithogalum biflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
