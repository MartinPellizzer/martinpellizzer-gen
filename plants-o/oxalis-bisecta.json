    "intro": "Oxalis bisecta, commonly known as the false shamrock, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features trifoliate leaves that resemble the shamrock, with each leaflet being deeply lobed. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically in spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Oxalis bisecta is also valued for its ability to spread via rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
