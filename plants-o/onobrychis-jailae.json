    "intro": "Onobrychis jailae, commonly known as the Maltese burr, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive burr-like seed pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are enclosed in spiny pods, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Onobrychis jailae is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
