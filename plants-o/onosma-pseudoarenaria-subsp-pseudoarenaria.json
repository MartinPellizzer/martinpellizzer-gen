    "intro": "Onosma pseudoarenaria subsp. pseudoarenaria, commonly known as the sand thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sun-exposed environments. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xerophytic gardens."
