    "intro": "Octomeria oxychela, commonly known as the narrow-leaf octomeria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
