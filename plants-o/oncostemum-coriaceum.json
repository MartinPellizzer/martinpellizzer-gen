    "intro": "Oncostemum coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf oncostemum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick, leathery cuticle, giving them a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland areas. Oncostemum coriaceum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
