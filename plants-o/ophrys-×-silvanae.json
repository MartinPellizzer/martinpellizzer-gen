    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 silvanae, commonly known as the hybrid bee orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ophrys apifera (the bee orchid) and Ophrys insectifera (the wasp orchid). It is a terrestrial orchid with a sympodial growth habit, featuring a basal pseudobulb and a single, often curved leaf. The plant produces showy, bee-like flowers with a specialized labellum that mimics female bees to attract male bees for pollination. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows across Europe. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a hybrid species, showcasing the genetic diversity and adaptive strategies within the Orchidaceae family."
