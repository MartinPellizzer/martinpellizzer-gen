    "intro": "Ophioglossum pycnostichum, commonly known as the dense-stalked adder's tongue, is a rare and ancient fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble a tongue, with a central vein running along the length of the blade. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in a distinctive, club-like formation at the base of the leaf. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
