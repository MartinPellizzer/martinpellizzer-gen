    "intro": "Orobanche variegata var. pseudosatyrus, commonly known as the variable broomrape, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its lack of true leaves and its reliance on root penetration into host roots for sustenance. The plant produces small, often colorful flowers that are typically white, pink, or purple in color. It is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can have significant impacts on agricultural crops and native plant communities."
