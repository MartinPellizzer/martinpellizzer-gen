    "intro": "Ophrys \u00d7 pseudoquadriloba, commonly known as the mimic orchid, is a hybrid species within the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate floral structure, which closely resembles the appearance of female wasps, a trait that plays a key role in its pollination strategy. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a specialized lip that mimics the body of a female insect. Its native range includes parts of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region. This orchid thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
