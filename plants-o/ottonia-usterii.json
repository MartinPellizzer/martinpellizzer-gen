    "intro": "Ottonia usterii, commonly known as the mountain holly or false holly, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through winter, making it a striking ornamental plant. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler climates. Ottonia usterii is often cultivated for its winter interest and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
