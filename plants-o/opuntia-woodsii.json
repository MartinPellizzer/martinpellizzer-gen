    "intro": "Opuntia woodsii, commonly known as the desert nightshade cactus, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy fruits called tunas. Opuntia woodsii is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are also used for food and traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
