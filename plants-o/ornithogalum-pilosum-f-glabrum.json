    "intro": "Ornithogalum pilosum f. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asparagaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its lance-shaped, grass-like leaves and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is native to southern Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish this form from the typical variety of Ornithogalum pilosum."
