    "intro": "Ononis picta, commonly known as the painted rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, branching inflorescences. Ononis picta thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique appearance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
