    "intro": "Olea excelsa, commonly known as the African olive, is a tall, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It can grow up to 30 meters in height, with a broad, spreading canopy and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single stone. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, dry soils. Olea excelsa is valued for its timber, which is hard and durable, as well as its ecological and cultural significance in its native region."
