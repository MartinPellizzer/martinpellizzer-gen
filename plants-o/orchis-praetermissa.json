    "intro": "Orchis praetermissa, commonly known as the lesser twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, upright flower spike that bears a single, pale green to yellowish orchid-like flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows, often in areas with acidic soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. The species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological and floral characteristics."
