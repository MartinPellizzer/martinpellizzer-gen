It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display a mix of yellow, orange, and red hues. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, allowing it to grow on other plants without being parasitic. Oncidium tetraskelidion requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
