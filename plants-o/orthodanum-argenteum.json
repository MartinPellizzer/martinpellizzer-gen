It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Orthodanum argenteum is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
