    "intro": "Orchis maculata var. psychrophila, commonly known as the alpine spotted orchid, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive spotted leaves and delicate, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its survival depends on specific microclimates and is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
