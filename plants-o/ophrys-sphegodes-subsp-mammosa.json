    "intro": "Ophrys sphegodes subsp. mammosa, commonly known as the bee orchid, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to parts of Europe and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive flower shape, which closely resembles a female bee, a feature that plays a crucial role in its pollination strategy. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to brownish in color, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of insects. The subspecies mammosa is distinguished by its larger, more robust flowers compared to other forms of Ophrys sphegodes."
