    "intro": "Oncidium panamense, commonly known as the Panamanian orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, long-lasting flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its pseudobulbs store water, allowing it to survive in dry periods. Oncidium panamense is popular among orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
