    "intro": "Orobanche haenseleri, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is native to regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a short, fleshy stem with no true leaves. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact agricultural crops if left unchecked."
