    "intro": "Opuntia galapageia subsp. myriacantha, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos prickly pear, is a cactus native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its flat, fleshy stems that are covered in spines and are adapted for storing water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various native species."
