    "intro": "Oreomyrrhis involucrata var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender oreomyrrhis, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
