    "intro": "Ophrys holosericea subsp. parvimaculata, commonly known as the small-spotted bee orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which mimics the appearance of a female bee to attract male bees for pollination. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a distinctive dark marking near the base. This subspecies is known for its specialized pollination mechanism and is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
